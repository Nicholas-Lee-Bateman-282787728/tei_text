            William Clarke, First Chief Justice of Indiana Territory*
            
            CLARENCE E. CARTER
            
            William Clarke was distinguished as the first Chief Justice of Indiana Territory. During the time of
                    his brief tenure of that office, the territory in question included not only the present state of
                    Indiana, but also 
                  Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin
               ,
                    and a portion of the present state of 
                        Minnesota
                    . Clarke was therefore the first Chief Justice of the states mentioned as well as of
                    Indiana.
            A veil of mystery conceals the antecedents and early life of Justice Clarke. Intensive investigation
                    has, for example, failed to disclose any facts concerning either the date or place of his birth. No
                    evidence is available which connects him with other contemporary families of the same name. The
                    circumstances connected with his formal education are unknown. Evidence concerning the date and
                    place of his marriage like-wise appears to have disappeared. The present study must therefore be
                    confined to the last six years of his life; even for these years our information is meagre.
            Clarke's first appearance in public life was his appointment on December 22, 1796, by
                    President Adams, as 
                        United States
                     District Attorney For 
                        Kentucky
                    .1 According to his commission2 he was appointed
                    to the office as from the state of 
                        Kentucky
                    , which was apparently his residence at the time of that appointment and until his
                    removal to Indiana Territory in 1800. From the slight amount of his correspondence now extant, it
                    would appear that his domicile until near the end of 1800 was in Bourbon County, a fact also
                    substantiated from his subscriptions as "formerly of Bourbon [County]

                    the county mentioned, to assume charge of the sale of his lands and the recovery of money from
                    persons indebted to him.3
            
            In regard to the circumstances connected with the appointment of Clarke as District Attorney, an
                    unnamed writer of an obituary notice in the 
                  
                            Kentucky
                         Gazette (
                        Lexington
                    ), December 2, 1802, refers to his selection for that post in the following language:
                        
                        At a period when the government had become somewhat unpopular in this state by the novelty
                            and oppressive aspect of the excise law, the post of District attorney of the 
                                United States
                             for 
                                Kentucky
                             was offered to several gentlemen of the profession, and refused. It was
                            tendered to Mr. Clarke, and accepted, from an opinion, which he afterwards communicated to
                            the author hereof, that there was very little wisdom in refusing to exercise an office under
                            the administration of our country, whose errors we could not reform by a mere refusal.
                    
            
            The significance of the statement in the above tribute becomes evident when viewed in relation to
                    Clarke's experience during his four years as federal prosecutor. From the beginning of his
                    term of office, he was confronted with opposition in high places.
            The enemies Clarke made were numerous and politically powerful, which may explain in part his failure
                    to receive consideration for appointment to further office in 
                        Kentucky
                    . His most persistent opponent, as disclosed by the fragmentary materials which have
                    been preserved, was Harry Innes, Federal District Judge, in whose court Clarke appeared in behalf of
                    the 
                        United States
                    . An early evidence of this dissension and mutual suspicion is found in an excerpt from
                    a letter of Judge Innes to John 
                  Brown, United States
                Senator from 
                        Kentucky
                    , dated March 18, 1797: 
                  
                     
                        I have some reason to believe that the Atto Clarke has written to the Secy. of the
                                    Treasury informing that I had refused to allow some witnesses who had attended the
                                    Court in behalf of the U. States & requesting money for the
                                    purpose—it was in the case of Steele, prosecuted for assaulting a revenue
                                    officer—Will you be so good as to enquire the matter & if he has
                                    written anything disrespectfully of me, be pleased to obtain an extract of his
                                    letter, and send it to me. I did refuse to make the allowance (because they 
                              
                                 3 Deed Book E. 569, July 29, 1801-Sept. 12, 1801
                                            (Bourbon County, 
                                                Kentucky
                                            ).
                           
                                     had not been summoned) for their mileage. If he
                                    compels me to state the facts, his ignorance will be very conspicuous.4
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            One explanation of the unrelenting animus of Innes towards Clarke, aside from a possible political
                    one, may be found in the latter's frequent motions for new trials of cases decided against
                    the 
                        United States
                     by federal juries, and in his appeals from the verdicts of juries. One type of
                    legislation involved concerned the right of the 
                        United States
                     to receive duties, in addition to penalties, on stills which had not been duly entered.
                    For example, in July, 1799, Judge Innes rendered a decision on a motion by the District Attorney for
                    a new trial in the case of James Morrison v. William Trimble,5
                    in which the motion was denied.6 Again, as late as June 30, 1800, there is found
                    a motion by Clarke to set aside a verdict in the Federal District Court because of
                    "manifest error" in the proceedings, a motion quickly denied by Innes. These
                    episodes doubtless prompted Innes to report to Senator 
                        Brown
                    , March 5, 1800, that James Morrison was also "well convinced of
                    Clarke's incompetency & wishes to get rid of him."7
            
            There were other incidents which contributed to widen the breach between Clarke and Innes. In the
                    course of his official duties, Clarke reported to the Secretary of the Treasury, in a letter which
                    has not been found, his view of the facts concerning the issues involved in the various revenue
                    cases. This provoked Judge Innes to ascertain through Thomas T. Davis, then a Representative in
                    Congress from 
                        Kentucky
                     and later Clarke's successor as Judge in Indiana Territory, whether the
                    District Attorney had reflected in any way upon the Court. In an answer to a letter of inquiry from
                    Davis, dated January 18, 1800,8 the Secretary of the Treasury wrote on February
                    25, 1800: 
                  
                     
                        On reviewing Mr Clarks correspondence, I find, that several
                                    questions relative to the interpretation of the Revenue Laws, have been decided by
                                    the Judge contrary to the opinion of the District Attorney—In particular
                                    it is understood to have been decided, that the 
                                        United States
                                     can recover no duties on Stills, which have not been duly
                                    entered— … As the decision of the Judge must be conclusive, in
                                    case it shall not be controuled by a Superiour Judicial

                                     Tribunal, it will I presume be sufficient for me
                                    to assure you, that the representations of the District Attorney, have ever been
                                    temperate and respectful;—it was his duty to give information of the
                                    result of the suits instituted by direction of this Department, and in the mode of
                                    communicatting this information he has certainly given no cause of Offence to the
                                    Judge or any other Individual.9
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            If his fellow 
                        United States
                     officials in 
                        Kentucky
                     did not highly esteem the District Attorney, the latter held an equally uncomplimentary
                    opinion of the administration of justice in the District Court in which he served. Writing from
                    Bourbon County to Secretary of State Timothy Pickering on February 15, 1800, in regard to a pending
                    proposal in Congress to reorganize the Federal Courts, he observed that such legislation would be
                    highly beneficial so far as 
                        Kentucky
                     was concerned: 
                  
                     
                        Should this bill pass into a law, of which I hope there is little doubt, for the
                                    necessity of some such measure has been here long severely felt, perhaps it will
                                    contemplate the appointment of another Judge—Should this be the case, I
                                    hope no person will be appointed to that important Office whose political sentiments
                                    are at war with the necessary measures of Government. The embarrassments we labour
                                    under here, chargeable to that source, are such that the recital would scarcely be
                                    credited, and should an improper appointment take place, upon the present occasion,
                                    it would rivet the system so completely that the evils resulting therefrom would be
                                    incalculable—I think I may with safety pronounce that the obstacles to be
                                    surmounted in executing the laws of the 
                                        United States
                                     in this district, are more than in all the other States of the Union
                                    together—In fact, where the Government is concerned, the law has got into
                                    such an alarming state of uncertainty that I cannot, with safety, undertake to give
                                    an opinion—10
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            No direct proof has been found to indicate that the opposition to Clarke was on political grounds;
                    there is evidence, however, that his political sympathies were of the Federalist persuasion. The
                    letter quoted above would seem to bear such an interpretation. That he owed both his appointment as
                    District Attorney of 
                        Kentucky
                     and as Chief Justice of Indiana Territory to a Federalist administration is plain. In a
                    second letter,11 the only other one in Clarke's

                            the conclusion that Judge Clarke was a Federalist and probably an ardent one. The expression
                            "friends to Government", found in the second letter, was in common use
                            among strong Federalists.
               
                     hand which has come to light, there is indication that he was not
                    in sympathy with the prevailing Republican sentiment in 
                        Kentucky
                    . The letter is of sufficient significance in this connection to be published in full.

                        Sir I was duly honored with your Letter of the 27 of October on the 24th Ulto, covering two copies of the pamphlet respecting the
                                    perfidy and Violence of the French Government in subverting the Republic of 
                                        Geneva
                                    —I thank you for the Communication and will use due diligence
                                    to give this piece of useful information an extensive circulation—
                        When the Mail arrived, by which I received this Letter, I was then starting for 
                                        Mason
                                     Court, where the press of Hunter & Beaumont is kept, from
                                    whence the paper called the Mirror issues—thinking this
                                    would be a good opportunity of putting the boasted impartiality of their paper to
                                    the test, I took a copy of the pamphlet with me and got one of their Subscribers to
                                    make application to have it published for general information, but the Answer
                                    returned was "that, upon its being accompanied with forty dollars, it would
                                    be printed"—Some of the friends to Government were for making up
                                    this sum, but the Majority would not gratify them with the payment of a single
                                        dollar*—
                        I will make the same application at the press of Mr Bradford and
                                        Mr Steward—

                                    they also refuse, it will be the cause of several withdraw [ing] their subscriptions
                                    from the support of papers that by being thus conducted, would pervert the very end
                                    of their institution—I am, with respect and

                     by that body two days later.14 His second, or
                    permanent, commission was dated December 12, 1800.15 A prolonged, and in general
                    an unsuccessful, search has been made in the 
                        Washington
                     archives and elsewhere for papers disclosing the circumstances leading to the
                    appointment, especially with respect to the character of the recommendations which may have been
                    presented in support of the nomination. The first hint that Clarke was under consideration for the
                    Indiana position is contained in a letter from Secretary of State John Marshall to President Adams,
                    August 26, 1800: 
                  
                     
                        I enclose you a letter from the Governor of Indiana respecting the appointment of
                                    judges. … I recollect a conversation with you on this subject at this

                                    Clarke the present attorney for the 
                                        United States

                                        determination.16
                        
                     
                  
                To this letter, the President, writing from 
                  Quincy, Massachusetts
               ,
                    September 5, 1800, replied: 
                  
                     
                        I should rather have waited, till nominations could be made to the senate when we
                                    might have had opportunity to make more Inquiries but as Mr
                                    Harrison seems so anxious, and you seem to be satisfied, I am willing to appoint
                                        Mr William Clarke, Majour Henry 
                                        Vanderburgh
                                     and Mr John Griffin.17
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            Under the provisions of the Ordinance of 1787, which was the fundamental law of all the early
                    territories of the 
                        United States
                    , the tenure of the supreme judges was during good behavior.18
                    Consequently there was a certain security for Clarke in regard to his new position, even though he
                    was in all probability a Federalist. He reached 
                        Vincennes
                     late in 1800 and there took the oath of office from Governor Harrison on January 10,
                    1801; he in turn administered the oath of office to Harrison on the same date.19
                    His salary, however, began with the date of his appointment, as was customary in the case of the
                    members of the judiciary as contrasted with administrative officials. The annual salary of a
                    territorial judge was eight hundred dollars; Clarke's

                     first installment of pay was for the period from October 10, 1800
                    to June 30, 1801, in the sum of $580.43.20 The records of the court
                    during his incumbency disclose but slight information concerning his career, other than that he
                    presided at each session of that body beginning March 3, 1801, until November 11, 1802 inclusive,
                    except for the session days of September 16, 17, and 20, 1802.21
            
            The members of the superior court of the territories constituted also, together with the governor,
                    the legislative branch during the first or temporary stage of territorial government. In addition to
                    his judicial duties as first Judge of Indiana Territory, therefore, Clarke participated in the
                    making of the laws in the early part of the first stage of government. In the first session of the
                    legislature, January 2, 1801, to January 26, 1801, seven laws and three resolutions were passed and
                    signed by Governor Harrison and by one or more of the judges, including Clarke in every instance. In
                    the second session, January 30, 1802 to February 5, 1802, two additional acts were passed which he
                    also signed.22
            
            Clarke likewise signed a petition to Congress, Dec. 31, 1801, as a member of a board of trustees
                    chosen for establishing a seminary of learning at 
                        Vincennes
                    , to be called Jefferson Academy, praying for a donation of land in furtherance of that
                        project.23
            
            Aside from his judicial and legislative activities, the fact is now disclosed that Clarke was heavily
                    engaged in mercantile pursuits. In an inventory and appraisal of his estate at the time of his
                    death, there are listed stocks of merchandise which no ordinary householder would have possessed.24 Selecting at random, the following items indicate the character of the goods:
                    3000 saddlers tacks, 4500 needles, 274 gallons of whiskey, 400 gun flints, 11 pairs of spurs, 17
                    curry combs, 112 brass thimbles, one gross of shoemakers awls, 64 yards of 
                        London

            In the same documents there appears an account current with one George Clarke, possibly of 
                        Louisville
                    , or 
                  Danville, Kentucky
               , in the sum of $4907.81, which includes
                    an item of cash paid by George Clarke for transporting goods from 
                        Baltimore
                     to

                    to $35.00, also was allowed to Jean Baptiste Barrois.26 It is
                    unnecessary to adduce further evidence to prove the statement concerning the Chief
                    Justice's mercantile interests.27
            
            In the papers mentioned, are likewise found listed the various other personal possessions of Judge
                    Clarke, such as household effects, slaves,28 horses, and cows. But the most
                    interesting and perhaps the most significant group of entries comprises a catalogue of the books in
                    his private library. Since descriptions of a frontier lawyer's library for the late
                    eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries are exceedingly rare, there is abundant justification for
                    reproducing in this paper the list in question.29 The bibliographic
                    identification of certain of the books has not been ascertained, but in the main it has been
                    possible to place

                            outstanding debts amounted to between two and three thousand dollars. It is not without
                            significance that Clarke was in a position to cash the drafts of territorial officials. On
                            one occasion he cashed a draft of John Rice Jones on the Postmaster General for the sum of
                            $50.46, and, on the same day, Aug. 28, 1802, he cashed Governor
                            Harrison's draft for $250.00 and Secretary John Gibson's for
                            $187.50.

            Clarke's career as Chief Justice was terminated by his sudden death at 
                        Vincennes
                     on November 11, 1802. "The last stages of his illness were so rapid that he
                    had no time to receive the last sacrements [sic] of the Christian
                        religion."31 He had presided at the session of the General Court,
                    which met on that day, pursuant to his own order of September 22, 1802.32 He
                    died intestate, leaving a wife, Elizabeth Harveis Clark,33 and small daughter,
                    Louise. Frances Harveis, a second daughter, was born two weeks after her father's
                        decease.34 On the day following his death, Judge Clarke's burial
                    occurred at St. Francis Xavier cemetery in 
                        Vincennes

                        Clarke visited McKee's office on November 11 and received an injection. Dr. McKee had
                        visited Clarke on November 5, 7, 9, and 10, 1802, each time prescribing opiates and other

                        is an account of Thomas Coulter against the estate for boarding Judge Clarke, Mrs. Clarke, and
                        the latter's sister, from August 22 to September 15, 1801. There are other references,
                        in the records mentioned, to "Miss Sally", which must refer to Sarah Harvey
                        (Harveis), who apparently made her home with the Clarke family.

            A Stumbling Block in Midwestern Genealogy*
            
            GILBERT H. DOANE
            
            In the last sixteen years the writer has lived in three midwestern states: 
                  Michigan, Nebraska
               , and 
                        Wisconsin
                    . During that period he has met hundreds of midwesterners with whom he has discussed
                    genealogy and specific problems in ancestry. It seems to him that nine out of every ten people to
                    whom he has talked about genealogy have one or more lines of ancestry going back through 
                        Vermont
                    , and at least half of those lines are blocked with a progenitor who "came from 
                        Vermont
                    " or lived and died there. Thus it seems to him that 
                        Vermont
                     has become a stumbling block to those in the Middle West, and especially in the Great
                    Lakes basin, who are attempting to trace their ancestry back to immigrants from across the ocean.
                    This paper is an attempt to sum up in a general way what has been learned about 
                        Vermont
                     genealogy in twenty-three years of poking around in the printed and unprinted records
                    of that state, in a desire to help researchers find the clues which will enable them to carry back
                    their lines another generation or two and, so to speak, get them out of 
                        Vermont
                     and into one of the other New 
                        England
                     states.
            As one's experience in genealogical research grows, one realizes more and more how essential
                    it is to efficient procedure to have some knowledge of the history of the community in which the
                    problem arises. The man or woman who can most easily solve a problem in ancestry is he or she who
                    knows the most of the historical background of that problem. That background is nothing more nor
                    less than the history of the town or region in which those ancestors lived—not so much
                    the political history as the social and economic history, for political history grows out of social
                    and economic history just as family history is part and parcel of social and economic history.
            
               
                        Vermont
                     is the northwestern state in New 
                        England
                    . Its eastern boundary is the Connecticut River—in fact
                    the middle of the Connecticut River, for the Supreme Court of the 
                        United States
                     has only this past year settled a boundary dispute which has existed for one hundred
                    forty-six years between 
                        New Hampshire
                     and 
                        Vermont
                    . Its northern edge, the

                            Annual Indiana History Conference in the State Library and Historical Building, 
                                Indianapolis

                     international boundary for about one hundred twenty-five miles
                    between the 
                        United States
                     and 
                        Canada
                    , is spotted with customhouses whose main activity seems to be the annoyance of tourists
                    driving back and forth to and from 
                        Montreal
                     and Quebec. Lake Champlain forms most of the western boundary, although there is an
                    imaginary line for seventy-five miles or so between the southern tip of the Lake and the 
                        Massachusetts
                     line, the southern boundary of the state. 
                        Vermont
                     is a small state, hardly bigger than the largest county in 
                        Nebraska
                    , and but a pocket handkerchief when compared with 
                        Texas
                    . Of course, if it were ironed out, for it is very mountainous, it would probably be
                    almost as big as Indiana. Its population has never exceeded 360,000, except possibly on Labor Day or
                    Thanksgiving Day, when all the folks are back from 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Boston
                     to spend the holiday and see what the old place looks like. Yet out of this little
                    state comes, in proportion to its population, a larger percentage of notable Americans than any
                    other state in the Union can boast.
            Strange as it may seem, 
                        Vermont
                     has had more or less the same history as any of the states here in the Great Lakes
                    basin, for it was explored and settled by the French (it differs in that the French settlements were
                    not permanent, although a very few of the French names persist). As a matter of fact, the same man
                    who sailed into 
                        Plymouth
                     harbor on an exploring trip sixteen years before the Pilgrims landed there, was the
                    first white man to go into this territory of the Green Mountains. Samuel Champlain, born in the
                    small seaport town of Brouage in Saintonge, a province of western 
                        France
                    , spent his early days acquiring knowledge of the sea and navigation. He made many
                    voyages and exploring expeditions to the new world of America. On one of these, in 1608, he
                    established the first French colony on American soil at Quebec, which, incidentally, is an Algonquin
                    name meaning "narrowing of the stream." He spent that entire year exploring the
                    surrounding country. The following summer he set forth on another of these trips, and in July, 1609,
                    according to his journal, he went up the Richelieu River, where he encamped on the second of that
                    month. His journal tells of meeting some savages in canoes, and then goes on to say: "We
                    left the next day, continuing our course in the river as far as the entrance to the lake.
                    … The next day we entered the lake, which is … perhaps 50 or 60 leagues long.
                    There I saw four beautiful  islands 10, 12 and 15 leagues long,
                    which formerly had been inhabited by savages, like the River of the Iroquois; but they had been
                    abandoned since they had been at war with one another. … " Champlain proceeded
                    southward along the west side of the lake, touching at many points now well known, such as
                    Plattsburg. He thus became the first white man to look at the Green Mountains, or, as he called
                    them, the verts monts. The islands he speaks of are now known as Isle La Motte,
                    North Hero, and South Hero, all part of the present state of 
                        Vermont
                    ; Vermonters almost always speak of them as "the Islands."1
            
            Following the establishment of French colonies along the Saint Lawrence Valley and the planting of
                    English colonies along the New 
                        England
                     coast, hunters and traders quickly took advantage of the old Indian trails through the
                    Green Mountains. Dealers in furs followed these ancient pathways which have become today the paved
                    roads over which thousands of tourists pass each year. Sometimes these French and Indian parties
                    were friendly; at other times they were bent upon mischief, and raids upon the settlements in
                    Masschusetts and 
                        New Hampshire
                     resulted. Thus, with the French and their Indian allies to the north and west of the
                    region and the English on the south and east, the territory became a sort of no man's land.
                    In 1665 or 1666, the first settlement, and that of a military nature, was made when the French,
                    under Captain de La Motte, built Fort St. Anne on Isle La Motte. This was not, however, a permanent
                    settlement, as it was destroyed in 1670.2 There appears to have been no attempt
                    to establish homes and till the soil, although seigniories along the lake shore as far south as 
                        Burlington
                     were granted by the French government.
            The first permanent settlement was made at Fort Dummer on the Connecticut River,
                    by people from 
                        Massachusetts
                    . This fort, in reality a simple blockhouse, was built near the present town of
                    Brattleboro in 1724, just one hundred and four years after the settlement of 
                        Plymouth
                    . This section of the country then belonged to the colony of 
                        Massachusetts
                    , having been purchased a few years previously from the colony of 
                        Connecticut
                     by William Dummer, Anthony Stoddard, William Brattle, and John White. A few years

                    present town of Westminster, one of the most beautiful in the state, with many of its houses built
                    before the Revolutionary War.3
            
            Thus began the settlement of 
                        Vermont
                     and thus began the controversy over the ownership of the territory. It will be noticed
                    that the first township granted by the government of 
                        Massachusetts
                     comprised territory formerly owned by 
                        Connecticut
                    . 
                        Connecticut
                     had originally acquired this land as a grant from 
                        Massachusetts
                     in return for territory ceded to that state. In 1740, the dispute regarding the
                    boundary line between 
                        Massachusetts
                     and 
                        New Hampshire
                     was settled by the Crown, and the present line established. Thus this infant town in 
                        Vermont
                    , then called merely Number One, came under the jurisdiction of the governor of 
                        New Hampshire
                    . In the following year, 1741, a new provincial governor was sent out from 
                        England
                    , one Benning Wentworth, who was to have much to do with the subsequent history of 
                        Vermont
                    .
            It had always been understood that the province of 
                        New York
                     was bounded on the east by the western edges of 
                        Connecticut
                     and 
                        Massachusetts
                    , and consequently, when the boundary between 
                        New Hampshire
                     and 
                        Massachusetts
                     was settled by the Crown, it was supposed by the government of 
                        New Hampshire
                     that its western boundary was a continuation of that line. According to that, the
                    territory of the Green Mountains lay in the province of 
                        New Hampshire
                    .
            Acting on this supposition, Governor Wentworth concluded that the unsettled region between the
                        Connecticut River and Lake Champlain offered him a chance to make some
                    money on the side by selling grants therein. With this in mind, he began to advertise this land, and
                    in 1749 made his first grant in that territory. This was the town of Bennington, a tract of land six
                    miles square, six miles north of the 
                        Massachusetts
                     line and twenty miles east of the Hudson River. In the next fifteen years, he made
                    approximately one hundred thirty such grants, and the territory became known as the 
                        New Hampshire
                     Grants, a name which stuck to it for over a generation.
            The Royal Governor of 
                        New York
                     differed from His Majesty's Governor of 
                        New Hampshire
                     and claimed that the

                     … (
                                Albany
                            , N. Y., 1868), 3-4.
               
                     boundary between the Province of 
                        New York
                     and the Province of 
                        New Hampshire
                     followed the Connecticut River, and therefore the privilege of
                    granting the lands in that region belonged to him. He, too, acted in accordance with his views and
                    likewise granted several townships in that territory.
            The majority of the grantees under Governor Wentworth were people earnestly seeking new homes and
                    land of their own, so they, their relatives, or friends, immediately began to settle upon the land
                    which they bought. On the other hand, the 
                        New York
                     grants were purchased by speculators and were settled, if at all, by hirelings, or by
                    people who bought land of the speculating grantees. The result was a controversy which ultimately
                    disturbed even the King's Council in 
                        London
                    . First 
                        New York
                     and then 
                        New Hampshire
                     petitioned the King for jurisdiction, each governor continuing meanwhile to make his
                    grants. Finally, in 1764, the King in Council decreed that the Connecticut
                    River should form the boundary between the two provinces.
            By that time, however, many a 
                        New Hampshire
                     grantee had been living upon the land purchased long enough to get a portion of it into
                    arable condition. When a rival claimant came along from 
                        New York
                     and tried to oust him, trouble ensued. The 
                        New Hampshire
                     grantee did not propose to pay for his land twice, the New Yorker proposed to get that
                    for which he had paid. Hot and furious waxed the controversy, but the Yorkers were outnumbered,
                    since Governor Wentworth had several years start of the 
                        New York
                     Governor in his real estate business. A few years before the outbreak of the
                    Revolution, the famous Allen brothers, Ethan and Ira, not to mention their cousins, Seth Warner and
                    Remember Baker, had settled in the Grants, In defending their land titles, they organized the
                    well-known Green Mountain Boys, becoming, at least in the eyes of the government of 
                        New York
                    , an outlaw band, their coonskin caps and leather jerkins a symbol of hardihood that has
                    persisted to this day.
            The English government decided first one way and then the other in the matter of jurisdiction, giving
                    authority over the 
                        Vermont
                     area first to 
                        New York
                     and then to 
                        New Hampshire
                    . The settlers, disgusted with the vacillating policy of the Crown, fought off their
                    rivals. A price was placed upon the head of Ethan Allen by the government of 
                        New York
                    . Allen, a roistering but very resourceful fellow, was  highly amused and issued a rival proclamation in which he jeered at the Governor. About this time
                    the Revolutionary War broke out, and the news of 
                        Lexington
                     and 
                        Concord
                     flashed through the colonies. Allen, strange as it may seem, armed with a commission
                    from the Colony of 
                        Connecticut
                    , gathered his band, attacked and captured Fort Ticonderoga, and the Grants forgot for a
                    moment their private difficulties in the defence of the country against the British. However, not
                    even the magnitude of the Revolution could eclipse the smaller revolution in the Grants. And thus
                    the Vermonters at this early date stuck to their own knitting and declined to be stampeded into a
                    national landslide.
            Even before the Revolution broke, the 
                        New Hampshire
                     grantees had been meeting in conference to determine what should be done to secure
                    their land titles. Various meetings were held at various places, generally in the home of one or
                    another of the grantees who held their land under the jurisdiction of the governor of 
                        New Hampshire
                    . Later they even petitioned the Continental Congress to help them in the matter, but to
                    no avail, for the balance of power in Congress was held by representatives of states who favored 
                        New York
                    . Finally, a convention of representatives of the various towns in the Grants was called
                    to sit at Westminster on January 15, 1777. At this convention, which was attended by such famous
                    Vermonters as Thomas Chittenden, who became first governor of the state, Ira Allen, Jonas Fay, and
                    many others of fine caliber, the matter was settled. It was at this convention that the Declaration
                    of Independence of the State was framed and ordered published! Some of the towns did not send
                    representatives, but sent proxy votes for the formation of a new state. In the words of the records
                    of the Convention: 
                        This Convention, whose members are duly chosen by the free voice of their constituents in the
                            several towns, on the New-Hampshire Grants, in public meeting assembled, in our own names,
                            and in behalf of our constituents, do hereby proclaim and publicly declare that the district
                            of territory comprehending and usually known by the name and description of the 
                                New Hampshire
                             Grants, of right ought to be, and is hereby declared forever hereafter to be
                            considered as a separate, free and independent jurisdiction or state; by the name, and
                            forever hereafter to be called, known and distinguished by the name of NEW CONNECTICUT; and that the inhabitants that at present are, or
                            that hereafter may become resident, either by procreation or emigration, within said  territory, shall be entitled to the same privileges,
                            immunities and enfranchisements as are allowed; and on such condition, and in the same
                            manner, as the present inhabitants in future shall or may enjoy; which are, and forever
                            shall be considered, to be such privileges and immunities to the free citizens and denizens
                            as are, or, at any time hereafter, may be allowed to any such inhabitants of any of the free
                            and independent states of America; And that such privileges and immunities shall be
                            regulated in a bill of rights, and by a form of government, to be established at the next
                            adjourned session of this convention.
                     In the language of this document one can detect the 
                        Vermont
                     spirit of independence which has persisted to this day, even through November, 1936.
            The provisions of this manifesto were then incorporated in a more formal Declaration of Independence,
                    which was duly published in the 
                  
                            Connecticut
                         Courant, then the leading newspaper of New 
                        England
                    . It should be noted that in this declaration the territory was given the name
                    "New 
                        Connecticut
                    ." At another convention, sitting on June 4, 1777, the name was officially
                    changed to 
                        Vermont
                    , a name suggested by a Dr. Thomas Young, of 
                        Philadelphia
                    . This name, derived from the French "verts monts,"
                    meaning "green mountains," was much more appropriate to the territory, besides it
                    had become known that a section of land on the Susquehanna River was also designated as New 
                        Connecticut
                    .
            Thus was formed the "State of 
                        Vermont
                    ," which was virtually an independent republic for fourteen years. The
                    Continental Congress hedged and refused to recognize the autonomy of the region. The inhabitants
                    refused to submit to the jurisdiction of either 
                        New Hampshire
                     or 
                        New York
                    , and proceeded to hold a general election in 1777 at which Colonel Thomas Chittenden
                    was elected the first governor of the self-created state. Colonel Chittenden was the only member of
                    these early assemblies who had ever sat in a legislative body. He had been somewhat prominent in
                    town affairs in 
                        Connecticut
                     before he migrated to 
                        Vermont
                     and had represented his town in the Assembly of that colony. Moreover, he was one of
                    the most sagacious and astute men of his day. During this period repeated efforts were made to
                    secure the recognition the Vermonters so ardently desired. At one time, a few of the more
                    influential men of the "State" were even accused of treason against the 
                        United States
                     because of their negotiations with Great Britain. Parenthetically, let it be said that
                    it is hard to see the logic of a man's being called a 
                    traitor to a given country when he is not recognized as a citizen of that country! The writer is,
                    however, a Vermonter and probably neither logical nor reasonable!
            In 1781, representatives of the British government approached certain men high in the government of 
                        Vermont
                     with the proposal that 
                        Vermont
                     become an autonomous province of the British government. One can easily see how
                    strategic a position this would be for the British army. Here is the territory between two of the
                    rebelling states, with a long boundary line, furnishing many entries for British scouting parties
                    and armies, not to mention a lake on which naval maneuvers could be performed. The men in 
                        Vermont
                     who implied an interest in the proposal were Ethan Allen, his brother, Ira Allen,
                    Thomas Chittenden, the governor, and eight or nine others. The exact intent of these men has never
                    been definitely known, but it is the writer's belief that they hoped to force the hand of
                    the Congress of the Confederation and bring about a recognition of the independence of 
                        Vermont
                     and its admittance to the Confederation of States. However, they may have been playing
                    off one power against another, a game that many weak European states have played more than once. In
                    certain manuscript records in 
                        Canada
                     and 
                        London
                    , one finds that some of those negotiating on behalf of 
                        England
                     expressed an intuition that the Vermonters were playing a game with them. Be that as it
                    may, 
                        Vermont
                     did not become a British province. Incidentally, many Tory families moved to northern 
                        Vermont
                     about that time, thinking that they might be getting back to British soil. Finally 
                        Vermont
                     was recognized as an independent and sovereign state, and admitted to the Union in
                    1791.
            In this brief resumé of the history of 
                        Vermont
                     before statehood, it has been noted that the first permanent settlement was at Fort
                    Dummer, near Brattleboro, on the Connecticut River, for the French forts in the
                    Champlain Valley can not be considered as permanent settlements. The real settlement of this region
                    of the Green Mountains began when it was "made safe" by the cessation of
                    hostilities between 
                        France
                     and Great Britain after the French and Indian War. Prior to this time, settlement had
                    been made hazardous by the fact that well-known Indian trails through the region were continually
                    used by raiders, and, naturally, outposts could not be properly protected.
            
            Thus the stream of settlement begins about 1760, and pours northward from two main sources: 
                        Massachusetts
                     and 
                        Connecticut
                    . In general, the following division of the country can be said to hold: Colonists from 
                        Massachusetts
                     settled on the eastern slope of the Green Mountain range, in the Connecticut
                        River Valley; those from 
                        Connecticut
                     settled on the western side in the eastern part of the Champlain Valley, This does not
                    always hold true, however, for in 1770 at 
                        Norwich
                    , on the east side of the mountain, there were 206 people, all of whom came from
                            
                  Mansfield, Connecticut
               , or the vicinity of 
                        Mansfield
                    ; at the same time, in Bennington, on the west side, the prominent families were from 
                        Massachusetts
                    .
            As is usual in the opening of a new territory, settlement spread up the river valleys. Thus we find
                    the older towns in the Connecticut Valley, in the Hudson Valley, and in the
                    Champlain Valley, and the newer towns higher in the hills and farther north.
            Why was 
                        Vermont
                     settled? The answer is the usual answer in this country: the desire for more and richer
                    land. Always that is the cry of the pioneer: "Land, Land, more and better land".
                    The somewhat barren hills and meadows of 
                        Massachusetts
                     and 
                        Connecticut
                     had become pretty thickly populated; younger sons, and many of them, were coming along
                    with astounding rapidity, for there was no question of race suicide in those days when economic and
                    social conditions did not prohibit large families. As these boys married and needed homes of their
                    own, some of the older farms were split, but soon that division had to cease, and the younger boys
                    had to find new communities in which to settle. So in mid-eighteenth century the first wave of
                    migration from older New 
                        England
                    , with slight ripples of exception, was toward the newly opened territory of the Green
                    Mountains, the 
                        New Hampshire
                     Grants as they were then called. Consequently, in some cases we find the younger sons,
                    and some of the older sons of many of the best families of the two colonies of 
                        Massachusetts
                     and 
                        Connecticut
                    , and not a few from 
                        Rhode Island
                    , migrated northward and northwesterly to take up land purchased in the new region of 
                        Vermont
                    .
            Many of these early settlers went there on foot, with axe and gun in hand, to clear their land and
                    build log cabins to which they would bring their families in the succeeding year.  A typical case is that of the writer's own
                    great-great-great-grandfather, John Gilbert, who walked one spring with his son Nathan, from
                            
                  Fairfield, Connecticut
               , down on Long Island Sound, to 
                  Fairfield, Vermont
               , which is within seventy-five miles of 
                        Montreal
                    , and spent the summer there clearing the land they had bought from the grantees of the
                    township. The following spring they brought the rest of the family to the cabin they had built, the
                    site of which is marked by a tall elm standing a hundred rods back of the present house of the
                    writer's family.
            The period of settlement extends from about 1760 to 1820, or a period spanned by approximately two
                    generations of family history. By 1820, avenues of migration to the "West," as
                    everything west of the Hudson River was called by the New Englanders of that day, had been opened,
                    and those who had wanderlust in their blood found the allurements of this West much more enticing
                    than the difficulties of farming in the rocky hills and upland meadows of 
                        Vermont
                    . We find many families associated with 
                        Vermont
                     only during this sixty-year period, for some of the early settlers had caught the
                    pioneer fever, or inherited it from their immediate progenitors, and were moving westward to
                    "York State" and farther into 
                  Pennsylvania, Ohio
               , and
                    Indiana. According to the 1790 census there were 85,500 people in 
                        Vermont
                    . In 1800 there were 154,500; in 1810, 217,900; and in 1820, 236,000, or nearly three
                    times the number of thirty years before. It can be seen that the period of most rapid settlement was
                    between 1790 and 1810.
            Some of this settlement between 1790 and 1800 was due to the general restlessness which followed the
                    Revolutionary War. A study of the matter will reveal that there is always a period of agitation and
                    moving about following a war in our history. Probably the boys came home from war and found
                    themselves irritated by the return to a quiet life, or led on by a wider vision, sought better
                    opportunities. Possibly a few could not find work at home and moved on and on in an attempt to find
                    employment or land of their own.
            It is not necessary to go further into the history of the settlement of 
                        Vermont
                     in this paper, but those interested will find a perfectly proper Ph.D. thesis in the
                        Proceedings of the 
                        Vermont
                     Historical Society for 1921-1923 (pages 79-138), which is an interesting and careful
                    study of the settlement of  the state, showing with considerable
                    detail the paths of migration and the sources from which these early settlers came.
            Many of the printed sources for genealogical information regarding families that have lived in 
                        Vermont
                     will be familiar to some readers and some of them to all who are interested in
                    genealogy. By far the most important is Abby M. Hemenway's 
                  
                            Vermont
                         Historical Gazeteer, a sort of quarterly magazine issued over a long period of
                        years.4 Miss Hemenway was an indefatigable worker who spent the best years
                    of her life traveling over the state gathering at first hand the information which she worked into
                    her history. Many of the town histories were written by local people at Miss Hemenway's
                    request; many of her records were taken from original documents some of which have been since lost
                    or burned. A few years ago the 
                        Vermont
                     Legislature, inspired by someone who realized the value of a properly made index,
                    authorized the publication of a thorough index to be made at state expense. The index now forms the
                    sixth volume, and has greatly increased the value of the set. Miss Hemenway, at the time of her
                    sudden death in 1890, had projected a sixth volume which was never published, so the Gazetteer does not cover the entire state. It must be remembered that Miss Hemenway is not
                    always accurate, as few histories of that period are accurate, for, as already mentioned, much of
                    her material was secured by interviewing "old settlers," a source of greatly
                    varying reliability. In general, however, she can be relied upon to furnish a workable clue. As she
                    worked between 1865 and 1885 gathering information, much of it came from people who were actually
                    pioneers in the state, and much of it is available in no other place, for, as in many young
                    communities, pioneer records were poorly kept.
            Another important collection, which to most genealogists is little known, contains the Records of the Council of Safety and Governor and Council of the State of 
                            Vermont
                        , 1775-1836.5
                As the title indicates, these volumes
                    comprise original records of the various state councils and committees for their first half century,
                    the earlier volumes being the official journals of the pre-legislative assemblies such as that at
                    Westminster at which was declared the independence of the province.

                                 Historical Gazetteer, 5 vols., 1867-1891. The Gazetteer was published at 
                                Burlington
                             and other places. Index was prepared under the direction of
                            George W. Wing (Rutland, 1923).
                  
                     5 Eliakim Persons Walton (editor) 8 vols., (Montpelier,
                        1873-1880.)
               
                     Like many public records, these are of inestimable value to the
                    genealogist. An example of their usefulness may be drawn from the writer's own experience.
                    The earliest record of the settlement of his branch of the Gilbert family in 
                        Vermont
                     was in 1794, according to a deed which was the first dated record he could find. In one
                    of the volumes (IV, 37) of this set he found, under date of November 7, 1792, a record that Nathan
                    Gilbert was made a member of a Committee on Road Tax in Smithfield (now part of 
                        Fairfield
                    ), thus carrying back the date of their settlement two years. Genealogically much may
                    happen in two or three years, especially when such a record indicates that Nathan Gilbert was
                    sufficiently well known to the town's assemblyman to warrant his recommendation to the
                    Governor's Council for such an appointment. Incidentally, there are many, probably about
                    five hundred, biographical sketches of Vermonters of this period scattered throughout these eight
                    volumes. An index to these sketches is found in Volume III (pp. 459-64), and all the names of
                    persons are adequately indexed in each volume.
            For Revolutionary rolls there has been published John E. Goodrich's compilation of Rolls of Soldiers in the Revolutionary War, 1775-1783 (Rutland, 1904), which is
                    probably better known to many of those interested in D.A.R. ancestry than it is to the writer. These
                    are not necessarily complete, for every little while a new roll of some company comes to light and
                    has to be added to the others.
            The pension records in 
                        Washington
                     are important to genealogists. There are two printed keys to these records, which,
                    although incomplete, are nevertheless valuable. The first major attempt to print the names of
                    pensioners of the Revolutionary War, and certain data about them, was in 1835, when a report of the
                    Secretary of War, ordered by Congress, was printed in three volumes as Senate Executive
                        Document, No. 514, first session, twenty-third Congress. For the present purpose but a
                    portion of Volume I, devoted to New 
                        England
                     pensioners arranged by states, is of interest. There are one hundred sixty-four pages
                    of 
                        Vermont
                     pensioners, arranged by counties. With each name on the roll, are listed the
                    man's rank, annual allowance, sums received, description of service, date when placed on
                    pension roll, commencement of pension, age and remarks (which often constitute the date of  death). The second major attempt was after the data of the 1840
                    census were available, for this census included by name each pensioner then living. This list was
                    published by the Department of State in 1841, and constitutes a quarto volume of one hundred
                    ninety-five pages, again arranged by states, so it is simple enough to get at the 
                        Vermont
                     records. Unfortunately there is no index.
            These records of Revolutionary men should be supplemented by another important list of
                    "Soldiers of the Revolutionary War Buried in 
                        Vermont
                    ," published in the 
                        Vermont
                     Historical Society Proceedings, 1903-1904 (pp. 93-106, 114-165). This
                    not only lists all known Revolutionary soldiers who are buried in the state, but also lists the
                    names of various invalid pensioners of that war, resident in the state. This list was supplemented
                    by another in the Proceedings, 1905-1906 (pp. 189-203). Unfortunately both of
                    these lists are arranged by towns, rather than by surnames, and there is no index, so they are
                    difficult to use unless one knows the locality of the individual for whom he is searching. And to it
                    must be added the four volumes of unpublished genealogical records collected by the Genealogical
                    Records Committee of the 
                        Vermont
                     Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution. One set of these has been
                    deposited in the Continental Memorial Hall in 
                        Washington
                    , and another in the 
                        Vermont
                     Historical Society Library in Montpelier. The chairman of that committee is very
                    willing to copy records from these manuscript volumes.
            The Adjutant General of 
                        Vermont
                     published in 1935 a Roster of the War of 1812, in which are listed
                    all known 
                        Vermont
                     soldiers in that war. The list has been compiled from various sources, and no name has
                    been omitted of which a record has been found. The compiler has had all names checked with the
                    pension records in 
                        Washington
                    , so pensioners and widows receiving pensions are indicated, and the number of the
                    pension record is cited.
            Another important index to be found in the Proceedings of the 
                        Vermont
                     Historical Society for 1911-1912 (pp. 165-226) is that to Zadock Thompson's
                        History of 
                            Vermont
                        
                (edition of 1842), a book published at a time when indexes were not considered
                    necessary.
            Many years ago an enterprising individual in 
                        Burlington
                     commenced the publication of 
                        Vermont
                     marriage records,  but only one volume was ever
                    published. That contained the records for Montpelier, 
                        Burlington
                    , and Berlin. Other sources of vital statistics will be mentioned shortly.
            There are always the records of the first census, that of 1790.6 The user of them
                    should remember that town lines and town and county names have changed a great deal since 1790;
                    moreover the 1790's were moving days, so the location of a man in one town according to the
                    census does not mean that he could not be living fifty miles away, or even farther, the next year.
                    In using the 
                        Vermont
                     volume one should know that this census was not taken in 
                        Vermont
                     until 1791, so, many families may appear in two different volumes of the 1790 census.
                    For instance, the writer's great-great-grandfather Soule is listed as a resident of Pawling
                    in the 
                        New York
                     volume for 1790; and again in the 
                        Vermont
                     volume as an inhabitant of 
                        Fairfield
                    . Because of the date of this census in 
                        Vermont
                    , one can sometimes calculate to within a year the date of migration to 
                        Vermont
                     from any of the other states in which the census was taken in 1790.
            Genealogical students are familiar with the distressingly inaccurate and unreliable
                    "genealogical and family" histories published during the last two decades of the
                    nineteenth century and on into the twentieth. 
                        Vermont
                     was not slighted, for Hiram Carleton published such a work for the state, which is just
                    as unreliable as dozens of other publications of that time.7 However, not
                    infrequently these very books furnish an enterprising genealogist with workable clues, so they must
                    not be disregarded entirely. They should not, however, be accepted without thorough checking as bona fide proof of a descent. It is doubtful if any of the more important
                    patriotic societies will accept a reference to one of them without substantiating evidence.
            Unlike 
                  Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine
               , and 
                  New Hampshire, Vermont
                has made no effort to publish the vital statistics of the towns making
                    up the state. It is to be regretted that no plan to publish such records has been developed.
                    However, many town histories have been written. The worth of these varies greatly, as does that of
                    all town histories. A brief list of such individual histories is here given.

                    information as to names of early Vermonters is to be found in Volume XXVI of the 
                        New Hampshire
                    
                    State Papers. These are the records of the 
                        New Hampshire
                     Grants made by Benning Wentworth; appended to the grant of each township is the list of
                    the grantees. It must be remembered that not all the grantees settled in the town, but many of them
                    did, and one obtains from this list a valuable record. Many of the petitions of the 
                        New York
                     grantees may be found in the papers relating to the 
                        New Hampshire
                     Grants in the fourth volume of E. B. O'Callaghan's Documentary History of the State of 
                            New York
                        , where are to be found over five hundred pages of 
                        Vermont
                     records, many of them of great genealogical importance. For instance, some of the
                    petitions printed in full in this collection constitute virtual censuses of the several towns.
                    Unfortunately, there is no index.
            In looking for unpublished records dealing with a genealogical problem, the first thought of the
                    searcher is vital records. The Legislature of 
                        Vermont
                     passed an act several years ago requiring that each town clerk copy all vital records
                    to be found among his office records and send them to the  office
                    of the Secretary of State. These copies were made on cards, and the cards are now filed
                    alphabetically in Montpelier. There is a woman in immediate charge of them who is thoroughly
                    familiar with them. A letter to the Department of Vital Statistics, Office of the Secretary of
                    State, Montpelier, will bring an answer and frequently the records desired, provided that not too
                    many are requested. A simple and inexpensive form of insurance of an answer is to enclose return
                    postage with the query.
            Theoretically all cemetery inscriptions and church records were to be copied by the town clerks, but
                    actually this was done in very few towns. In many towns the records had been destroyed by fire or
                    flood before the act became effective, and, probably, in one or two places, the clerk was careless
                    and didn't get all the records even in the town books. Since the records in Montpelier are
                    by no means complete, failure to find a record there must not discourage the searcher.
            As to the use of vital records, all know that clues can be developed by analogy and from records
                    which are not those of the individual sought, as for instance from the birth record of his brother
                    or sister whose name is known to the searcher.
            Failing vital records, and sometimes to establish relationships indicated in vital records, one must
                    turn to probate records. 
                        Vermont
                     is rather peculiar in this respect, for the probate district boundary does not always
                    correspond to county lines. There are twenty probate districts in 
                        Vermont
                     and only fourteen counties. A list of these districts may be found in the 
                        Vermont
                     Year Book formerly called Walton's Register). Since the boundaries are not
                    defined in that book, it becomes necessary for the genealogist to use an atlas and more or less
                    guess at the probate office likely to contain the wills for which he is searching. He may even have
                    to resort to the hit or miss method in writing to probate clerks. To complicate matters still
                    further, some of the early probate districts have been redistricted and the records transferred.
            Land records in 
                        Vermont
                     are kept in the offices of the town clerks. Fortunately, because of their value in
                    preparing abstracts of title, indexes of grantees and grantors have been made in most offices, even
                    if witnesses of deeds and others mentioned in the body of the deed are not listed. Land records are
                    especially valuable in tracing a migration, and sometimes 
                    valuable in determining a relationship. John Doe of Sandwich, 
                        Massachusetts
                    , may buy a piece of land in Bennington, 
                        Vermont
                    , and fifteen years later, calling himself John Doe of Canton, 
                        New York
                    , deed that same land to someone else. Thus there is a record of two of his moves, from
                    Sandwich to Bennington and from Bennington to Canton. Or, he may deed that same land "for
                    the natural love I bear him" to his son, Thomas Doe, and in a later deed Thomas Doe of 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, may dispose of that land in Bennington, thus definitely placing Thomas Doe of 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, as the son of John Doe of Bennington, 
                        Vermont
                    , formerly of Sandwich, 
                        Massachusetts
                    .
            Church records, another important mass of unpublished records, are more difficult to trace. The
                    clerkship of the church changes, records get lost, ministers move away and sometimes take the
                    records with them. Houses burn and the records perish. But the genealogist of ingenuity will find
                    them if possible, for in them are sometimes records which are missing from the town
                    books—baptisms, admissions (sometimes by letter from another church a hundred miles
                    away), dismissals (especially those by letter to another church), and burials. Try the yearbooks of
                    the various denominations, such as the Congregational Yearbook, as the first source of information
                    concerning the individual to whom it is desired to write about such records. It will save postage
                    and grief if the letter is written directly to somebody, rather than to the postmaster who has to be
                    asked to give the letter to the proper person—such letters the writer has seen accumulate
                    in one small post office in 
                        Vermont
                    !
            In 
                        Washington
                    , D. C., there is the great mass of census records, gathered every ten years since 1790.
                    The 
                        Vermont
                     Historical Society in Montpelier has a photostat copy of the 1800 census of 
                        Vermont
                    , and the librarian of that society will consult it for a small fee. But the other
                    census records, and especially the 1850 record, must be consulted in 
                        Washington
                    , and generally it is wisest and easiest to have an experienced searcher consult them.
                    The 1850 census is especially valuable, for it mentions by name each individual in the family and
                    the state in which he was born. For instance, suppose John Doe is known to have been living in
                    Bennington, 
                        Vermont
                    , in 1850; in the census he will be found listed as John Doe, aged 79, born in 
                        Massachusetts
                    , perhaps with Mary Doe,  aged 75, born in 
                        Rhode Island
                    , in the same family. Supposing Mary to have been John's wife, you have clues
                    to the birth-place of each.
            In this paper an attempt has been made to give a bit of the historical background of 
                        Vermont
                     genealogy, and a resume of the more important printed sources of 
                        Vermont
                     data which can be found in the Indiana State Library or any good genealogical library,
                    and some idea of where to find unpublished official records. Other types of records which a
                    genealogist must use have not been touched upon, for the procedure in the use of Bible records,
                    cemetery inscriptions, and similar sources is the same the country over. A good genealogist not only
                    knows how to use records, but must possess enough imagination to discover new and obscure sources,
                    and "play his hunches" in using them. Moreover, he must know enough about human
                    nature to realize that psychology plays some part in gaining access to records, or getting other
                    people to use them for him. And so, good hunting!
         
         
         
            The Shakers in 
                        Knox
                     County
            OLIVER W. ROBINSON
            
            Many people here in the Middle West who maintain an interest in social experiments are familiar with
                    the details of the 
                        New Harmony
                     commune under the Rappites and later under the Owens, but few are aware that a somewhat
                    similar commune under the Shakers existed at Busro1 on the northern border of 
                        Knox
                     County during the first three decades of the nineteenth century.2
                    Even the people who now live on the land still known as Shaker Prairie are for the most part vague
                    as to who the Shakers really were and what they believed.3
            
            The official name for the Shakers was the "United Society of the Believers in
                    Christ's Second Appearing". They were also known as "Aletheans",
                    or the "Millennial Church"; but even the members of the society accepted the name
                    "Shaker", although it was originally applied to them in ridicule of certain
                    spontaneous movements which formed a part of the ecstasy of their worship.
            Peaceful, idealistic, industrious people, they lived and worked together communistically in their
                    thrifty little villages, recognizing neither death nor marriage—all of which may seem
                    extremely impractical and Utopian. Yet in enforcing their opposition to marital love, the Shakers
                    became realistic enough to house the sexes in separate dormitories.
            The earliest cabins built by the Shaker apostles, who came from 
                        Ohio
                     to the 
                        Knox

                        Sullivan County
                     border in 1808, were arranged to encourage celibacy,4, and the
                    entire mode of living was planned accordingly. A few quotations from the "Rules of
                    Propriety" will better develop this point: 
                        Brethren and sisters should not pass each other on the stairs … but when in
                            company with each other, the brethren should go upstairs first, and the sisters go
                            down-stairs first.
                        Brethren and sisters should not visit each other's apartments late in the evening.
                        When sisters walk in the fields, gardens, barns, or to the brethren's

                                     on Busseron Creek. The settlement was colloquially known as Shakertown.

                            it is no less important when they ride in a carriage.5
                  
                     Just how efficiently some of those Shaker precautions operated at Busro we shall see later!
            The Shakers further believed in common ownership of property; in the dignity of labor for every
                    member, regardless of how high or how low his position might be in the religious organization; in
                    complete abstinence from tobacco and liquor, except for medical use; in vegetarianism; and in a
                    plain, uniform style of dress—subdued colors, with white handkerchiefs and caps for the
                    women, and loose, coarse suits for the men, whose hair was usually worn long on the neck and cut off
                    in short bangs across the forehead.
            The preceding summary of characteristics no doubt appears simple enough, but actually to understand
                    the Shaker conception of life it is necessary to go briefly into the history and tenets of their
                    religion. The founder of the sect was Ann Lee, who was born in 
                        England
                     on February 29, 1736. The daughter of a blacksmith who lived in Toad Lane, 
                        Manchester
                    , she had little if any opportunity for education and went as a child to work in the
                    cotton mills. Even so, in spite of her humble origin, she was able—through a strong will
                    and an effective tongue—to exert a surprising amount of influence over her associates.
            After marrying a blacksmith named Stanley and losing her four children in early infancy, she turned
                    her attention to religion and became a believer in a certain Jane Wardlaw of Bolton-on-the-Moors,
                    Lancashire, who was prophesying that Christ would soon return to earth in the form of a
                    woman—as David had suggested in the Psalms. Immediately, Ann Lee began to preach the same
                    doctrine in Toad Lane, and was so successful in collecting street crowds that she was arrested and
                    imprisoned for two weeks at Old Bailey in 
                        Manchester
                    , the charges being "dancing, shouting, and blaspheming on the
                    Sabbath" and obstructing the thoroughfare.6 Upon her release, she
                    reported that one night during her imprisonment her cell had been filled with heavenly

                            original Rules may be found in various editions of the Compendium of the

                            rules are: "Shake your bed-clothes separately and air your bed every morning so
                            that the effete matter that has been thrown off from the body may escape and not remain to
                            be again absorbed by the lymphatics. … Never eat what you do not need because it
                            pleases your taste. It is better to bear the cross and be saved from dyspepsia."

                    previous success, was too great a taxation on the faith of Toad Lane. Consequently, after
                    considerable jeering and mud-throwing had been directed toward her, she had another vision in which
                    she was advised to go to America.
            Accompanied by seven disciples—two women and five men besides her husband—she
                    reached 
                        New York
                     shortly before the beginning of the Revolutionary War. Not liking the city, she moved
                    into the country, and with her disciples founded the settlement of Watervliet, near
                            
                  Albany, New
                            York
               . There, for three and a half years, she waited passively for
                    converts. In the meantime her husband left her, when she began to enforce celibacy on the grounds
                    that men must live as the angels live without any form of earthly love. Apparently Mr. Stanley was
                    only a blacksmith with little appreciation of angelic conduct.
            In other respects, the long period of waiting was successful. Finally, as the result of a religious
                    revival in the vicinity of 
                        Albany
                    , Joseph Meacham, a Baptist minister from Enfield, 
                        Connecticut
                    , and Lucy Wright came to Watervliet to see what Ann Lee had to offer in the way of
                    spiritual satisfaction. They immediately became converts and in turn won other converts so that a
                    second settlement of the followers of Ann Lee came into existence at Mount 
                        Lebanon
                    , which is now considered the parent colony. By this time Ann Lee was known as
                    "Mother Ann" and her followers as "Shakers."
            During the Revolution, since she denounced war, refused to take the Colonial oaths, and forbade her
                    men to serve on juries,7 she was for several months imprisoned in Pough-keepsie
                    under suspicion of being a British spy. This circumstance, though at first discouraging, really
                    turned out to her great advantage—for much publicity was attached to the imprisonment of
                    "the female Christ".8 After her release in 1780, she made a
                    rather successful missionary and faith-healing tour through New 
                        England
                     which resulted eventually in the formation of eleven additional societies.
            That tour proved to be the climax of Ann Lee's career. In 1783, she returned to Watervliet,
                    and about a year later 
                  
                     7 Even in recent times Shakers declined the privilege of voting.

                     died there. Many of her followers were somewhat surprised, for
                    they had expected Mother Ann to live forever, but Joseph Meacham and Lucy Wright—to whom
                    Ann Lee had given over all authority shortly before her death—ably explained that Mother
                    Ann had not ceased to live among her people but that clothed in new glory she was still visible to
                    those who had attained the proper degree of grace.
            Meacham and Miss Wright then preceded to draw up a definite covenant concerning the beliefs and
                    social system of all Shakers. Many of the tenets of the covenant appear to have originated directly
                    from Ann Lee's life, her ministry, and her theories: namely, that the godhead is both male
                    and female; that Christ in the person of Mother Ann has returned to earth to establish a kingdom of
                    heaven; that the believer—after confessing his sins—is already in heaven,
                    where there is no death and no marriage; that the body is not resurrected but that those who
                    "have passed from sight" are still in communion with all believers; that active
                    evangelism is unnecessary since God will attract converts when they are needed; and that labor is a
                    sacred privilege.9
            
            In 1796, Joseph Meacham died, but Lucy Wright and others of the faith efficiently carried on the
                    organization and promulgated the doctrine as opportunity presented itself. Soon after 1800,
                    Archibald Meacham and Issachar Bates, as missionaries, came to 
                        Ohio
                     and organized several societies, the most important of which was at Union Village in 
                        Warren
                     County.10 In 1808, they visited 
                        Knox
                     County, Indiana, where they purchased 1300 acres of land, mostly in Busseron Township,
                    from Robert Huston and Joseph Worthington.11 The original group of Shaker
                    colonists at Busro—as the settlement was officially named—numbered only two
                    dozen, but their agricultural success soon attracted several local residents,12
                    and, finally augmented in 1811 by a substantial influx of members of the society from Eagle Creek,
                            
                  Adams County, Ohio
               , the total number at Busro reached 300.13

            A narrative of the wholesale removal of the Eagle Creek society to Busro was written by Samuel S.
                    McClelland, one of the members of the group. The Eagle Creek settlers, having disposed of their 
                        Ohio
                     property, began the three-hundred mile journey to Busro in March, 1811. A few of the
                    men drove the cattle and sheep overland. The rest of the society came in two groups—the
                    first by boat to 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , where they unpacked their wagons and continued overland to Busro, making the entire
                    trip in twelve days; and the second came all the way by boat on the Ohio and
                        Wabash Rivers, making the trip in thirty days and enduring floods and
                    severe storms en route.
               14
            
            The enlarged Busro colony was just getting comfortably settled and organized in the summer of 1811
                    when the Indians became menacing. Two of "the brethren", when trying to retrieve
                    six horses that the Indians had stolen, lost their shoes, their hats, and almost their scalps.
                    Nevertheless, the Shakers went peacefully about the construction of a new dormitory, a sawmill, and
                    a school house. The latter was extremely necessary for there were 131 children in the colony even
                    though the theology of the society did frown upon marriage and reproduction.15
            
            Concerning the year 1812, McClelland wrote: 
                        On the 18th of June the President declared war against 
                                England
                            . This with the rumors of the Indian war added no little to our fears of
                            impending danger. Of course we would not build forts unless we intended to defend them, and
                            to this our faith was entirely opposed. As our settlement was almost the frontier, many
                            thought we had better leave the ground in peace than to run the risk of being insulted and
                            abused by troops [a seizure of several horses, saddles, and axes by "the Press
                            Gang" for use at Fort Harrison was especially distressing to the brethren] or of
                            being massacred by Indians. After mature deliberation it was decided for us to move away
                            from the place for the present. … 16
                  
                    
            
            Declining the protection offered them at 
                        Vincennes
                     by Governor Harrison, the Shakers left Indiana temporarily. With their stock and 150
                    wagons, they went to 
                        Kentucky
                    , crossing the Ohio River at 
                        Henderson
                    . From that point several struck out independently, but some went to South Union, Logan
                    County, where a Shaker colony had been established during the remarkable religious revival of
                    1800–1802 in 
                        Kentucky

                     and others founded a colony at Pleasant Hill in Mercer County. A
                    few went northeast to the Union Village community in 
                        Warren
                     County, 
                        Ohio
                    , and still a few others to 
                        Brown
                     County, also in 
                        Ohio
                    .17
            
            Two years later, however, many returned to Indiana and revived the settlement on Shaker Prairie.
                    Gradually—to accommodate groups of forty to sixty persons each—houses were
                    built as they were needed, the last and most elaborate being built in 1820, the Shaker heyday in
                    Indiana. This last mentioned structure was built of brick, made by the Shakers themselves, upon a
                    foundation of sandstone brought from the banks of the Wabash River. The house
                    was fifty feet square and three stories in height. The lower floor, besides having sleeping
                    apartments for twenty-four, contained a large worship hall made possible by a series of folding
                    doors, and the two upper floors together accomodated thirty-six persons. The lower hall was used for
                    devotional exercises each evening.
            In the framework of walnut and in the plastering—which was held in place by oak planks
                    cracked or grooved on the surface rather than by lath—expert workmanship came to light
                    when the building was finally razed in 1875.18
            
            During the decade that followed the return to Busro in 1814, the Shakers were fairly successful and
                    happy. They engaged in agriculture, made cutlery, brooms, baskets, and linen, and operated a grist
                    mill. Their surplus products they shipped to 
                        New Orleans
                     by flatboat. A volume dealing with the Millenial Church that was published in 1823,
                    reported that the Busro community had two hundred inhabitants.19

                        they spent a night in the Shaker community. In his diary, 
                            Mason
                         wrote: "At Busseron Creek we found a society of Shakers, with a fine farm
                        and snug buildings. We stopped with them over night and found comfortable lodgings and good
                        table fare, the first that we had had since leaving home. These people had mills on the creek
                        and were engaged in erecting a splendid flouring mill. … From the larders of these
                        people we replenished our stock of provisions. … " The party remained at
                        Fort Harrison over night, and returned to the Shaker village the next day: "We took our
                        leave and returned to the 
                            Quaker
                         village. They are what is [sic] called the Shakers or Shaking Quakers, and lived in
                        a community as a family, and seemed to be in possession of many comforts and conveniences, and
                        appeared happy. … " Dr. Philip

                                    to her taste; that some of the society were too low, and that the table was below
                                    all criticism. The good lady appeared to be about to run from one extreme to the
                                    other, for she added that in the summer she would go to a Shaker establishment near 
                                        Vincennes
                                    . … 20
                        
                     
                  
               
                
            The area which the Shakers occupied at Busro was conducive to malaria; and, after suffering several
                    bad epidemics and an alarming number of deaths, they decided to leave Busro forever. Issachar Bates,
                    who in a sense might be considered the traveling secretary of the western Shakers, recorded briefly:
                    "The removal from Busro took place in March, 1827, and oh, what a trying day it
                        was!"21 Samuel McClelland adds that, while spending the night in 
                        Vincennes
                    , the Shakers were given a serenade by some of the citizens as a gesture of farewell.
            Ten years later the entire property in 
                        Knox
                     County had been disposed of, and Shakers in Indiana became a forgotten people. Many of
                    the members had disbanded. The others had gone with Issachar Bates to the settlements in 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Ohio
                    .22
            
            In time those settlements also passed out of existence, the organization at South Union, 
                        Kentucky
                    , continuing bravely, however, until 1922, when the $250,000 estate was sold
                    at auction.23 The discouragement, though not the actual prohibiting, of
                    reproduction had been a disadvantage in trying to maintain numbers; and, as the years passed,
                    sacrifice of personal property to the common good had become distasteful to the individual workers.
            In recent times the Shakers have died out rapidly. At the end of 1922, of the fifty-eight Shaker
                    communities that once flourished with a membership of 4,800, the following remained: Mount

                        bricks and other materials were preserved and used in the construction of a residence for Dr. W.

            Indiana Republicans and the Re-election of President 
                        Lincoln
                    
            
            WINFRED A. HARBISON
            
            Possibly the most famous single act of Abraham Lincoln was his issuance of the definitive
                    Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. Such a fact, however, was hardly discernible from the
                    contemporaneous reception the Proclamation received in Indiana. The Democrats denounced it in
                    comprehensive terms as unconstitutional, provocative of dissension throughout the North, and
                    therefore detrimental to the Union cause. Most of the Republicans were willing to defend the
                    measure, but relatively few were inclined to praise it with enthusiasm. Some agreed, to be sure,
                    with the radical Julian brothers, who exclaimed that "The Year of Jubilee Has
                    Come" and hailed the Proclamation as the greatest act in all history.1
                    Also a new journal, the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Gazette,
               2 soon made its appearance as the champion of the
                    emancipation policy in the Hoosier state. But most of the journalists were lukewarm and careful to
                    explain that the purpose of the war had not changed from the preservation of the Union since the
                    Proclamation was designed to weaken the Confederacy.3 In fact some Republicans
                    expressed serious doubts of the effectiveness of the measure, and even energetic Governor Morton
                    admitted in his message to the Legislature that "it remains to be seen what effect this
                    proclamation will have in suppressing the rebellion."4
            
            There were two fundamental causes for this lack of enthusiasm among 
                        Lincoln
                    's Hoosier supporters. One was the relatively conservative nature of a majority
                    of them on the emancipation issue.5 The other was the particularly
                    unsatisfactory condition of both political and military affairs

                            made a long speech in Congress on "The Mistakes of the Past—The Duty of
                            the Present," in which he castigated 
                                Lincoln
                            's early slavery policy. Admitting that the Proclamation was moving in
                            the right direction, Julian continued: "A wise policy of war is not enough.
                            Proclamations of freedom will, of themselves, accomplish little. What we need is action,
                            instant, decisive, defiant action, scourging faithless men from power, sweeping away
                            obstacles and kindling in the popular heart the fires of a new courage and hope. The
                            government should arm the colored men of the free States as well as the slaves of the South,
                            and thereby give effect to the proclamation of freedom. … " Congressional Globe, 37 Congress, 3 Session, 1064–1069.

                     at that time and the tendency to blame the President for this
                    condition. In October, 1862, the Indiana Republicans had suffered a serious defeat in the state and
                    congressional elections, which they were inclined to attribute largely to the unsuccessful
                    prosecution of the war by the national Administration.6 Although Lincoln
                    responded to this rebuke at the polls by dismissing Generals McClelland and Buell, the conservative
                    commanding generals of the main armies of the East and West respectively, the change did not bring
                    victory to the Union. On December 13 the Army of the Potomac under the command of General Burnsides
                    suffered one of the "most bloody and disastrous" reverses of the war at 
                        Fredericksburg
                    . Any chance of advancing southward during the winter immediately vanished; the capture
                    of 
                        Richmond
                     apparently was as remote as it had been a year before. A few days later the two key
                    armies in the West fought major battles, suffered heavy losses but failed to make any perceptible
                    progress towards the suppression of the rebellion. Many thousands of Indiana soldiers had been
                    engaged in these battles and many hundreds of them had been killed or wounded. The prevailing gloom
                    and despondency deepened almost to despair, even among the Republicans.7 As the
                    people of Indiana came to the conclusion that the enormous sacrifice in life and fortune had been in
                    vain, their enthusiasm for the Union cause reached its lowest ebb of the entire war.8
            
            During the early weeks of 1863 the "Copperhead" element in the Democratic party
                    took advantage of this situation to make defiant attacks upon the Lincoln Administration and its war
                    program. As a result the Republicans were virtually impelled to become constant defenders of the
                    President and his policies. Public meetings were held and "Union Leagues" were
                    formed by Republicans and War Democrats to counteract the "Copperhead" activities,
                    by pledging wholehearted

                     7 About the same time disquieting reports reached Indiana that the
                            President had quarrelled with the Republican members of the Senate over the personnel of his
                            cabinet, especially his retention of the conservative Seward. The belief spread that the
                            cabinet had not been "harmonious in regard to the method of prosecuting the
                            war" and "unquestionably" did not possess "the
                            confidence of the nation." On December 23, the 
                                Indianapolis
                            
                            Journal bluntly declared: "If the President had force of
                            character enough for his place he would speedily end these turmoils by turning out the whole
                            concern and making a new one. Most of the Republicans, however, directed their criticism at
                            the retention of Seward, who, they declared, had lost the confidence of the nation because
                            he was not in favor of a vigorous war policy.

                    tendency, nevertheless, to damn the President with faint praise, as the following resolution of the
                    Union meeting in 
                        Muncie
                     will illustrate: 
                        RESOLVED, That while we admit that the President, under the influence of the ordinary
                            infirmities of human nature, and imperfections of human judgment may have fallen into
                            mistakes, in many particulars, which have operated seriously to retard the overthrow of the
                            rebellion, we believe that, as a whole, his administration has been characterized by great
                            moderation, wisdom, caution, forbearance and the purest patriotism, and impartiality, and it
                            is the duty of all citizens, patriots, and lovers of humanity to give him their warm, hearty
                            and unwavering support to the end.9
                  
                    
            
            By early spring a widespread popular reaction had set in against the obstructionist and anti-war
                    tactics of the "Copperheads".10 The people of Indiana longed
                    for peace but they wanted permanent peace, which they felt could be secured only by the restoration
                    of the Union. Therefore the adherents of the President faced the opening of the spring military
                    campaigns with renewed hope and confidence, but with a better understanding of the difficulties
                    involved than during the two previous years. Consequently, when the rejuvenated Army of the Potomac,
                    under "Fighting Joe" Hooker, the idol of the Radicals, met defeat at
                    Chancellorsville, most Republicans evinced keen disappointment but not the profound discouragement
                    and discontent of the year before.11 They were still confident of ultimate
                    victory and anxious for another trial of battle. When Lee undertook his second invasion of the
                    North, however, the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Gazette came forward as the newest and henceforth the most prominent Republican
                    critic of the Administration. On June 2 the editor censured the President for not having sufficient
                    troops in reserve to follow up a victory or to recover from a reverse, and urged the immediate
                    application of conscription for that purpose. A few days later, as the situation steadily became
                    more critical, the Gazette denounced the Administration's military policy
                    in most comprehensive terms, and demanded the display of more energy and efficiency or the
                    substitution of more competent men, declaring that

                            that has discouraged, vexed, and at times almost crushed the hopes of, and driven to
                            despair, the loyal people of the Nation. The history of the world does not afford another
                            example of such an utter lack of forethought, of energy, of inability and want of competency
                            to comprehend and grapple with a great emergency of state—of imbecility, we will
                            say, for we believe it and feel it—as has been shown from the very commencement
                            of this war, and all the way through … by the men constituting the
                            Administration. There is no use denying this, or in trying longer to blink it or hide it. It
                            is true, and every earnest, loyal man in the nation feels, sees, and deplores it. We have
                            seen it and felt it all the while, and have more than a hundred times urged the fact upon
                            members of the Administration12. … We presume thousands of
                            others have done the same. …
                        At this moment three hundred thousand more troops are needed in the field. … Why
                            are they not there? Whose fault is it? … The fault is at 
                                Washington
                            . And we do most solemnly think it is time the people should rise, en masse, and demand of the men at the head of the affairs of this imperiled
                            Nation that they do something and at once, commensurate with the magnitude of the occasion
                            … or that they give way or be put away by the President, and let others take
                            their places who are able for the task and in whom the people have confidence! The crisis of
                            the Nation is upon us. Is the Administration prepared for it? If not, why not and whose
                            fault is it? God save the Republic.13

                     in July increased the confidence of the Republicans in the President as well as in the
                    ultimate victory of the Union. From the outbreak of hostilities the most basic cause of popular
                    dissatisfaction with the Administration had been the lack of decisive military success; at last the
                    people felt that the tide had turned. Although many Republicans were disappointed that
                    Lee's army was neither captured nor annihilated,14 and some blamed the
                    Administration's lenient treatment of disloyalty in the North for the serious draft riots

                    ,15 nevertheless their criticism became infrequent and qualified,
                    and their praise of Lincoln's course became more widespread

                            Chancellorsville: "To retain him an hour longer were cruel kindness to him and
                            little less than treason to the country." June 18 the

                            The latter journal maintained that Seward was chiefly responsible for the timid, half-way
                            measure of the Administration "toward rebel sympathizers in the North and
                            apprehended more danger from his continuance in the Administration than from "all
                            other causes put together."
               
                     and genuine.16 His political followers were
                    particularly enthusiastic over his 
                        Springfield
                     letter, in which he clearly indicated that he opposed any compromise with the rebels or
                    any modification of his Emancipation Proclamation and favored the employment of all lawful means for
                    the suppression of the rebellion. Even the critical 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Gazette commended highly "the plain, honest, straight-forward manner of
                    the President, his candor and patriotic intentions, and his unanswerable arguments and conclusive
                    reasoning." Reassured that he would take no backward steps on emancipation to appease the
                    "Copperheads", the radical organ declared that earnest patriots of all parties
                    would "look at him with even more faith and confidence than ever before, to pilot our
                    national ship out of the perils that now surround it."17 Under these
                    encouraging circumstances it was only natural that his Hoosier supporters should evidence their
                    increasing satisfaction by giving substantial majorities to the Administration candidates in the
                    fall elections of 1863.18
            
            When the President, in his annual message, announced a moderate reconstruction policy, with a
                    Proclamation of Amnesty for repentant rebels, he further increased his popularity with his political
                    friends in Indiana. They felt that he had adopted the safest and soundest method of solving a very
                    difficult problem. His program was enthusiastically welcomed as "eminently wise and
                    satisfactory" and as the product of a "gigantic mind, a towering intellect, a
                    learned lawyer, a great statesman, and a merciful Executive."19 The
                    strong anti-slavery men were especially impressed by Lincoln's rigid adherence to his
                    emancipation policy for reconstruction as well as for the war. "We like `Old
                    Abe's' way of getting at the merits of things", exclaimed one journalist,
                    "and his plan of reconstruction on a basis which will insure permanent peace, forever
                    removing the one cause of our national difficulties from our midst, is peculiarly gracious

                            further and say that if Mr. Lincoln fails to comprehend … the necessity of reform

                    Proclamation of Amnesty had "solved" the dangerous problem of reconstruction. A
                    few weeks later "cheering accounts" of the "good effects" of the
                    amnesty policy began to come in "from all quarters".21
            
            The real test of President Lincoln's popularity was to come in his campaign for re-election.
                    By the beginning of 1864, many Republicans were already considering the question of his
                    renomination. The improved military situation, which presaged the victorious termination of
                    hostilities and the restoration of the Union, naturally redounded to the political advantage of the
                    Commander-in-Chief. In Indiana the Republicans or Unionists were divided roughly into three classes
                    in respect to their attitude towards the question of renomination. By far the largest class
                    comprised those who believed that "Old Abe" was, all things considered, the best
                    man to complete "the great task remaining before us". Soon after the elections of
                    1863 it became evident that the popular confidence in the President was increasing rapidly, and that
                    many people were coming to believe that he must be continued for another term. This sentiment was
                    particularly prevalent in the southern section of the State, where the Republicans were relatively
                    conservative on the war and emancipation issues. In Congress Senator Henry S. Lane was the most
                    prominent Hoosier favoring the President's re-election.22
            
            Taking their cue from the people, several of the local journalists came out enthusiastically for
                    Lincoln's renomination, and some even placed his name at the head of their editorial
                    columns. On November 14, 1863, the 
                        La Porte
                    
                    Herald practically declared for his renomination and on December 8 the 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Journal took the same step in more emphatic terms. On January 2, 1864, Charles
                    Powell, editor of the Herald, became one of the first to place Lincoln's
                    name at its masthead with this endorsement: "We believe that he is better qualified to lead
                    this nation through the fiery ordeal through which it is now passing than any other living
                    man". During January the

                        Lincoln
                    .23 On February 10 the Express explained the
                    prevailing sentiment: 
                        The people are emphatically for Mr. LINCOLN, for another term of office, and it would be
                            unwise to not heed this fact. Almost every mechanic, merchant and farmer, together with the
                            politicians, of the country, prefer him to any other man and will labor for his re-election
                            with a zeal and indefatigability which no other candidate could possibly command. Besides
                            being the strongest man, the past history of Mr. LINCOLN demands his renomination and
                            re-election. His administration requires that endorsement from the people, and they will
                            willingly bestow it, if their preferences are not overlooked. There is no man in the whole
                            country who has the strength to oppose Mr. LINCOLN'S nomination successfully.
                            …
                    
            
            Some of the Lincoln advocates, showing more enthusiasm than discretion, suggested that their champion
                    should be nominated by the acclamation of all loyal men. To accomplish this, it was proposed that
                    the separate Union State conventions should appoint presidential electors and thus obviate the
                    necessity of a national convention.24 When this plan proved impractical, the
                    Lincolnites set to work to secure instructions for their candidate from the State conventions which
                    would make his nomination in the national convention a mere formality.25
                    Naturally many postmasters and other federal office-holders, with a selfish interest involved, were
                    working for the President, but the movement also rested on a solid popular foundation.26
            
            Another group of Republicans took a less active part in the early discussion of the presidential
                    question. Most of them were apparently friendly to the President's renomination, but some
                    felt that the agitation of the matter was either impolitic or premature. Others wanted to be in a
                    position to support without reservations the Union nominee, whoever he might be. The newspapers in
                    this group included the

                         Republicans of manipulating the

                         movement for personal advantage. In a letter to the

                        Gazette (February 25, 1864) McNeely denied that the postmasters were any more
                        enthusiastic for 
                            Lincoln
                         than the people. In May 1864 McNeely assumed the editorship of the 
                            Evansville

            The third class consisted of those Republicans who preferred another candidate to Lincoln. Aside from
                    a few disgruntled office-seekers, this opposition to renomination came almost exclusively from the
                    radical wing of the party. These men believed that 
                        Lincoln
                     had been too tender toward traitors, too cautious in his prosecution of the war, too
                    slow in developing his emancipation policy.27 For the next presidency they
                    wanted a more aggressive executive, one more determined to crush the rebellion by any and every
                    means. The most extreme element of this faction comprised the small band of German Unionists who
                    bitterly opposed the President's renomination. Their attitude was expressed by the Indiana Freie Presse, when it declared: "We cannot and dare not vote for
                    Lincoln, unless we are willing to participate in the betrayal of the republic, unless we are willing
                    to remain for all future the most despicable step-children of the nation".28 The more moderate opponents of renomination, however, generally realized and sometimes
                    admitted that the vast majority of the Union men were for the President.29 They
                    exerted themselves chiefly to keep the presidential contest an open one as long as possible, so that
                    their own candidate would have a chance for the nomination in case 
                        Lincoln
                    's popularity should substantially wane.
            The only radical candidates to attract much attention in Indiana were General 
                        Fremont
                     and Secretary Chase. 
                        Fremont
                     had the zealous support of most of the Germans and a few others.30
                    After 
                        Lincoln
                    's renomination in June, the Indiana True Republican declared
                    that its "personal preference" at first had been 
                        Fremont
                    .31 But the editor did not openly advocate his
                    nomination—probably because he was afraid that such a course might defeat George J.
                    Julian's re-election to Congress by alienating some of the Lincoln supporters.

                            enthusiastically in favor of the renomination of Mr. Lincoln. The movement is not managed;
                            it is spontaneous beyond the possibility of a doubt; it is a great ground swell which will

                     promote his candidacy. In October, 1863, Chase had visited 
                        Indianapolis
                     and was particularly attentive to Morton; a few days later one of Chase's
                    political lieutenants approached the Governor to see whether his support could be relied upon.32 But Morton was not willing to jeopardize his own chances of re-election by
                    participating in the factional contest for the presidential nomination.33 The
                    two most influential Republican Congressmen from Indiana, Julian and Schuyler Colfax, the latter
                    Speaker of the House of Representatives, were decidedly friendly to Chase's candidacy;34 but both hesitated to oppose Lincoln's renomination as long as
                    popular sentiment was evidently so strong in his favor. A few of the less prominent politicians and
                    journalists were in a similar position. Urged on by some of Chase's Treasury agents, these
                    men were particularly anxious that the State convention should take no"premature"
                    action in favor of Lincoln's renomination. On February 5, 1864, one of Chase's
                    supporters wrote to him from 
                        Indianapolis
                     that there was strong pressure for Lincoln

                    Gazette was the chief radical organ in the State, its position on the presidential
                    question was somewhat variable and inconsistent. As early as October 13, 1863, the editors had
                    declared that 
                        Lincoln
                     would ruin his chance of re-election unless he decided the factional controversy in 
                        Missouri
                     in favor of the "Radicals." Two days later, however, the Gazette announced with enthusiasm: 
                        We have always looked upon Mr. Lincoln not only as the best man, probably
                            in America, for the place he now occupies, all things considered, but as a Providential man, or as the instrument in the hands

                                    opponents that he was working for Chase's nomination; the editor declared
                                    that Julian had written to his friends, invariably expressing himself in favor of 
                                        Lincoln
                                    . The Free Press maintained, however, that Chase was
                                    amply qualified for the presidency and that Julian had a right to support him if he
                                    wished.

                            affairs of our nation during the present terrible crisis.36
                  
                     In December the Gazette was again skeptical, maintaining that the
                    President made a fatal mistake by deciding the 
                        Missouri
                     question in favor of the "Conservatives," and insisting that he must
                    take a radical stand on reconstruction or be defeated for re-election.37 But by
                    the opening of 1864 the editors were being swept along by the 
                        Lincoln
                     current, publishing frequent editorials and articles commending the President and his
                        course.38 On January 14 they declared that 
                        Lincoln
                     "would be nominated by acclamation, and that too by the People."
            During February, however, the tone of the paper rapidly changed to one of cautious but persistent
                    opposition to re-nomination. This shift was effected chiefly by the retirement of one of the
                    publishers, J. C. Burnett, leaving J. H. 
                        Jordan
                    , an old political friend of Chase, as sole editor.39 On February 9, 
                        Jordan
                     led off with an expression of regret at the "disposition to go too fast
                    … in the way of President-making." Three days later the Gazette declared for
                    "The One-Term Principle" for the presidency, an obvious ruse of the 
                        Lincoln
                     opponents. Advancing in his opposition, the editor maintained that "the
                    enthusiasm for Mr. Lincoln as the next President is fast dying out. There are very good reasons for
                    this. The enthusiasm was not genuine, but fictitious and forced—and by the wrong class of
                        men."40 On the eve of the state convention 
                        Jordan
                     declared that since there was "a strong opposition" to 
                        Lincoln
                    's renomination, it would be very unwise for that body to take any action on
                    the presidential question.41
            
            Meanwhile the Republican supporters and opponents of 
                  
                     36 The Gazette continued with the following accurate
                            appraisal: "We see things in Mr. Lincoln's conduct at
                            times—things that he does or fails to do—which we object to and think
                            are not right. He is too slow or too easy, too cautious or too tender towards traitors. Thus
                            we often feel, and doubtless thousands of others do the same. But on second, sober thought,
                            it generally turns out that Mr. Lincoln was nearest right—all things considered.
                            … We do not believe he would do a wrong act, a cruel act, or an unconstitutional
                            act, not even to save his own life—unless he was convinced that it was his duty
                            to do so for the greater good to the greater number. … For certain emergencies
                            and particular causes we may often fancy that some other man would do better than Mr.
                            Lincoln. Perhaps he would. But `in the long run', taking all things into account
                            and remembering the various interests and different classes of men and parties to deal
                            with—where would we find a man so eminently fitted for the emergency and the
                            times as Abraham Lincoln?"

                     the President's renomination were expressing themselves
                    in a more official manner. In accordance with the instructions of the State Central Committee, the
                    Union men in each county met on February 13 to select delegates to the State convention. Practically
                    every county convention adopted a resolution strongly endorsing the Lincoln Administration, and a
                    considerable number of them officially declared for the President's renomination.42 No record of a county declaring against renomination has been found; even the
                    inaction of many county conventions does not generally signify opposition or lack of enthusiasm, for
                    delegates to state conventions were ordinarily uninstructed on presidential nominations. Some of
                    these bodies, moreover, did not even declare for Morton's renomination, which was very
                    popular with Republicans and a more immediate concern.
            Under these circumstances the delegates, accompanied by thousands of others, gathered at 
                        Indianapolis
                     on February 23 for the supreme test in the Union State Convention. The anti-Lincoln men
                    fully realized that their only reasonable hope lay in preventing the convention from taking any
                    definite action on the presidential question. What is of greater importance, they knew that if they
                    lost Indiana their cause would be practically hopeless in other States. Aroused by these efforts to
                    forestall the will of the majority, the ardent Lincolnites were more than ever determined to secure
                    a formal declaration for the President's renomination.43 Prominent
                    among the anti-Lincoln faction were the Germans and some of Chase's henchmen,44 while the leadership of the pro-Lincoln group included such Presidential apointees as
                    Colonel "Dick" Thompson, a provost marshall, and John Defrees, Superintendent of
                    the Government Printing Office. Between these extremes were the moderates, who were generally for
                    Lincoln but would favor expediency.

                    temporary officers and before a permanent organization could be effected. In fact
                    while the delegates and spectators were still intermingling, Cyrus M. Allen, Union candidate for
                    Congress in the first district, rushed to the platform and hastily introduced a composite resolution
                    endorsing both the Lincoln and Morton Administrations, renominating Morton and instructing the
                    delegates to the national convention for Lincoln.45 Such a popular move
                    naturally brought forth tremendous enthusiasm and applause from both delegates and spectators, and
                    amidst this excitement the resolution was put to a vote and declared unanimously carried. In the
                    meantime Alexander Metzger submitted to the temporary President a counter resolution of the Germans
                    requiring the delegates to the national convention to be "perfectly free and
                    untrammelled" in their votes for President, but this resolution was never submitted to the
                        delegates.46 Later in the day the platform committee obtained the Allen
                    resolution from the Secretary of the convention, and rearranged its parts so that one resolution
                    renominated Morton and another instructed the delegates to the national convention to use all their
                    influence for 
                        Lincoln
                    's renomination. This last resolution was unanimously adopted by the committee
                    as the fifth plank in the platform, was reported to the convention by Thompson, the chairman, and
                    was again adopted "by a perfect storm of applause."47 No
                    speeches were made against 
                        Lincoln
                    's renomination, and those in his favor were received with "tremendous
                    cheering," especially the delegation of former-Governor Wright that the President was
                    "the man for the times above all living men."48
            
            The State convention apparently had settled the "presidential question" as far as
                    Indiana was concerned. But the delegates had scarcely reached their homes before the factional
                    bickering was revived. The Germans strongly resented the utter disregard of their wishes by the
                    majority of the convention;49 their mouthpiece, the Indiana Freie
                        Presse, bitterly denounced the Lincolnites and threatened that most of the

                                Indianapolis
                             and adopted a resolution in favor of Lincolns' renomination. Allen was
                            partially influenced, perhaps, by this action.

                            Journal, Feb. 24, 1864.
                  
                     49 February 26 the 
                                Indianapolis
                            
                            Gazette printed a letter from Alexander Metzger explaining the attitude of
                            the 
                                German
                             Republicans.
               
                     Germans would bolt the Union Party rather than support the
                        President.50 The Chase men also were greatly chagrined and disgruntled at
                    the result of the convention. Several of them wrote to their champion, explaining their failure and
                    denouncing the tactics of the Lincoln "agents." Their general contention was that
                    the Lincoln supporters were afraid to let the presidential question come before the convention for
                    open discussion and therefore attached the Lincoln resolution to Morton's nomination in
                    order to railroad it through on the Governor's popularity, without even an opportunity to
                    vote against it.51 Some of the Chase men maintained also that the Lincoln
                    resolution was adopted merely by a popular assemblage and not by the official convention of
                    delegates. The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Gazette publicly made the same complaints and insisted that the decision was
                    "snap judgment" and not "a fair and honest expression of
                    opinion." That a majority of the people had come to "hurrah for Old Abe"
                    the editor admitted, but he contended that many of the delegates were opposed to the resolution
                    instructing for 
                        Lincoln
                     because they realized the "great impropriety in committing the State to him at
                    this time."52
            
            Such contentions did not long go unchallenged. In fact the editor of the 
                        Dayton
                     (
                        Ohio
                    ) Journal, one of Chase's friends at the convention, admitted
                    openly that the "unanimity" for Lincoln was so strong that there was no
                    perceptible undercurrent against the instructions for his renomination.53 While
                    the moderate 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal believed that the instructions were premature and conducive to dissension,
                    the editor sternly rebuked the radical Republicans for their "factious, persistent
                    resistance" to the will of the great majority of the party.54 The
                    avowed 
                        Lincoln
                     journals showed much greater resentment toward the course of the Gazette and its allies. They maintained that fully nine-tenths of the Union men of Indiana
                    were for 
                        Lincoln
                     and that no action of the convention was "more deservedly popular"
                    than the resolution for his renomination.55 Some of the editors were aroused by
                    the "stupidity"

                     and "knavery" of a "class of wondrous
                    wise politicians" who were attempting to destroy the widespread popular confidence in the
                    President in order to advance the interests of their own candidate.56 The
                    simultaneous appearance of the Pomeroy Circular, and other anti-Lincoln pamphlets, with their
                    impolitic disparagement of Lincoln by Chase men, furnished definite evidence of this policy and
                    added new fuel to the flame. Other Lincolnites, with greater discretion, sought to reconcile the
                    radicals to the President's renomination. Admitting that he might at times have been a
                    little slow, they argued that he was always sure and would be as firm for the future as Chase, 
                        Fremont
                    , or any other "ultra" candidate.57 Although most
                    of these journalists spoke highly of Chase, they insisted that Lincoln's tested ability and
                    integrity and his valuable experience made him the logical candidate for all loyal men.
            During March, 1864, the political skies began to clear in Indiana. To be sure the Pomeroy Circular
                    temporarily intensified the factional strife,58 but the popular current was so
                    strong in Lincoln's favor that his opponents were checked at every turn. Accepting the
                    verdict of the State convention, such influential local journals as the

                    Republican and Worthington Gazette, all of which had previously taken little part
                    in "President making," now came out for 
                        Lincoln
                     and placed his name at their mastheads.59 The blow that did most to
                    check the anti-
                        Lincoln
                     movement, however, was Chase's formal withdrawal from the presidential contest
                    early in March.60 Thus left stranded, the Chase advocates temporarily
                    acquiesced. Even the friends of Julian found it expedient to counteract reports that he favored
                    Chase's nomination by the announcement that "he has invariably expressed himself
                    in favor of the re-election of President 
                        Lincoln

                     Lincoln so manifestly that a contest… can be little
                    else than factious." The President's friends quickly pressed their advantage,
                    answering the objections of his opponents and urging all loyal men to unite behind him. They
                    emphasized his wise and far-seeing statesmanship, his firm adherence to liberty, his practical
                    judgment, his extraordinary hold upon the confidence of the people, his invaluable experience, the
                    psychological effect of his re-election upon the rebellion.62 One ardent Hoosier
                    solemnly proclaimed that Abraham Lincoln was "the instrument of God … to finish
                    the work he has so well commenced."63
            
            Throughout the spring months this attitude of confidence tempered with conciliation persisted among
                    the President's supporters.64 But the defeated anti-Lincoln forces did
                    not disappear. Many Germans continued to work for 
                        Fremont
                    , despite the apparent futility of their efforts.65 During April the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Gazette and the Chase men joined the agitation of the radicals to secure a
                    postponement of the national convention from June until September.66 The alleged
                    purpose was to avoid an almost certain split in the Union Party; the real objective was to provide
                    additional opportunity for possible popular reaction against the President, which would enhance the
                    changes of preventing his renomination.67 But his managers, realizing that a
                    sufficient number of states had already instructed their delegates for him, felt confident that
                    "the efforts of the `sore-heads'" would be unsuccessful68
            
            Checked in their attempt to postpone the convention, the Indiana radicals were soon opposing the
                    President upon a new front. They contended that his apparent countenance of the bitter attacks of
                    the Blairs upon Chase was "A National Scandal." Fearful that the episode would
                    result in Chase's resignation from the Treasury Department and a consequent lowering of his
                    prestige, his chief journalistic organ boldly declared: "The country at this time can
                    better afford to lose both Mr. Lincoln and the Blairs than Mr. Chase."69 Two days

                     later the despondent editor wrote to his champion: "I
                    feel now most positively that Mr. Lincoln ought not to be continued. I believe
                    this to be the darkest hour this Republic has ever seen!"
               70
            
            As the day of the national convention approached, the Chase leaders admitted that the President would
                    be renominated and prepared to acquiesce. They maintained that their opposition was not to Lincoln
                    "personally" but to his retention of "unreliable and dangerous"
                    advisers. "If Mr. Lincoln … will form a new Cabinet … of Radical men
                    … he will be the most popular man in America." The Gazette
                    urged the convention to require a pledge of him that "the Blair faction and
                    `conservative' influences" were no longer to dominate the Administration.71
            
            Some of the radical Germans, however, were not so easily pacified. They sent delegates to a
                    "Radical" convention which met in 
                        Cleveland
                     on May 31 and nominated 
                        Fremont
                     on an anti-Administration platform. But many of the Germans as well as most of the
                    other Hoosier friends of the General refused to bolt the Union Party.72 In fact
                    some were severely disappointed with his selfish and compromising stand against the Administration.
                    The Julian organ declared that although for a long time 
                        Fremont
                     had been "our personal preference," he had ceased to be a real force
                    in the "political world."73 Chase's supporters
                    declined to countenance the 
                        Cleveland
                     movement. The 
                        Lincoln
                     spokesmen almost unanimously belittled the convention as an assemblage of
                    "unknowns" and anti-
                        Lincoln
                     "sore-heads" who would have little or no effect upon the outcome of
                    the presidential campaign.74
            
            On June 8 at the national Union convention in 
                        Baltimore
                     the Indiana delegates contributed to the unanimous renomination of President Lincoln
                    and probably voted with more

                            Although some of the moderate Administration journals expressed regret that the President
                            had taken such an impolitic step, they did not share the evident despondency and
                            "humiliation" of the Chase men. See

                            Review declared that "the nomination of 
                                Fremont
                             has cast a gloom over the feelings of the administration Republicans in our
                            town," but this was mostly campaign propaganda.
               
                     genuine zeal than did some of the other delegates. The news of
                    the nomination was received by the Republicans of Indiana with as much enthusiasm as the fact of its
                    pre-determination and the critical condition of the country would allow. Popular
                    "ratification meetings" were held in most of the important towns. At the 
                        Indianapolis
                     meeting Governor Morton declared that the President, despite his occasional errors and
                    apparent slowness, still retained the unbounded confidence of the people. His renomination
                    "was the voice of the great people, speaking their confidence in a man who had been sorely
                    tried and found true." The masses believed in him because of his simplicity and directness
                    of character, his keen sense of humor, his unswerving integrity.75 Republican
                    journalists hailed the action of the Convention as eminently wise and popular. Some ignored and
                    others denied emphatically the Democratic charge that the renomination was the work of politicians
                    and officeholders and not the will of the people.76 Several stressed the fact
                    that 
                        Lincoln
                     was essentially a "working man's" candidate.77 Even the pro-Chase 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Gazette joined the chorus of approval. June 9 the editor admitted that 
                        Lincoln
                     could get more votes than "any other man in the nation," but insisted
                    that this circumstance resulted from "policy and justice more than from any personal
                    preference." Yet, perhaps "he has done better, all things considered
                        than any other man would have done."
            
            Despite the popularity of the nominee and the platform, the Unionist presidential campaign was
                    handicapped almost from the beginning. The apparent failure of the Union armies to make substantial
                    progress in crushing the Conferedacy greatly depressed the President's political prospects.
                    Consequently a widespread popular demand arose during July for the Administration to bring the war
                    to an end immediately. This peace sentiment was particularly strong in Indiana, partly due to the
                    large proportion of inhabitants of Southern birth or parentage.78 The peace
                    advocates were mostly "Copperheads" but included many wavering Unionists. When
                    Lincoln insisted upon emancipation as well as the restoration of the Union as a prerequisite for
                    official negotiations, the

                     peace men were inclined to believe the Democratic allegation
                    that he was unnecessarily prolonging the war. Motivated by either conviction or political
                    expediency, the Republican press, with practical unanimity, upheld the President's position
                    and maintained that no honorable and permanent peace could be secured until the rebellion was
                        crushed.79 Some journals virtually admitted, however, that there was
                    considerable "croaking" among their faint-hearted "friends" but
                    attributed this to impatience and misunderstanding.80
            
            During August the 
                        Lincoln
                     supporters were further alarmed by dissension and apathy within the party ranks. Some
                    of the nationally prominent radical leaders, who had never fully acquiesced in the
                    President's renomination, were encouraged by changing public sentiment to renew their
                    opposition. Their first open move came through the Wade-Davis Protest, which severely attacked both
                    the constitutionality and the propriety of 
                        Lincoln
                    's entire reconstruction program. This attack, however, received little if any
                    support from Indiana Republicans, who condemned it as the misguided efforts of
                    "extremists," who were futilely attempting to shake "the confidence of
                    the people in Mr. Lincoln's integrity, patriotism and fidelity to the Constitution and the
                        Union."81 Almost simultaneously the unique semi-secret attempt of
                    certain Eastern radicals to force 
                        Lincoln
                    's withdrawal from the presidential contest and the nomination of a new
                    candidate through another convention, was received with similar coolness by the Hoosiers. Even the
                    former Chase journal denounced the efforts of "a few impracticables" and
                    maintained that no man since 
                        Washington
                     had had "so unanimous a call to serve a second term" as 
                        Lincoln
                    .82
            
            Despite this outward harmony and assumed enthusiasm, the Unionists were greatly discouraged with the

                            Republican, Aug. 17. None of the Republican journals examined by the
                            writer approved of either the Wade-Davis Manifesto or the demand for a new
                        convention.
               
                     both in fighting the war and in obtaining peace; the results
                    were high prices, oppressive taxes, enormous debts, and a new call for hundreds of thousands of
                    additional troops, with almost certain prospects of a draft. Consequently, hundreds of disgruntled
                    Republicans, according to Democratic authorities, were deserting the Lincoln standard.83
            
            Publicly the Republican spokesmen had little to say except to deny the contentions of their
                    opponents. Privately they admitted their anxiety and discouragement. "Things look
                    … very blue," lamented one good Unionist. "If we cannot carry the
                    elections I believe our country is ruined—the government cannot exist one
                        year."84 Several prominent Republicans wrote to Andrew Johnson, 
                        Lincoln
                    's running mate, urging him to come to Indiana to help "save the
                        State."85 Governor Morton and others made similar appeals to Joseph
                    Holt of 
                        Kentucky
                    .86 Colfax and other influential Republicans tried to get General
                    Sherman to furlough some of the Indiana soldiers so they could come home to vote.87 When Sherman refused, Colfax wrote directly to the President for the furloughs. Both he and
                    Morton strongly urged 
                        Lincoln
                     to postpone the draft until after the state elections. Colfax also informed the
                    President that his peace stand was being used "most mischievously and damagingly. No one of
                    our friends wants an armistice, but a formal proffer … would help us, if rejected, even
                        more."88
            
            During September the political tide began to turn. The capture of 
                        Atlanta
                     and other military victories, plus the nomination of General McClellan on an anti-war
                    platform by the Democrats, furnished convincing evidence to many wavering voters that the best road
                    to the overthrow of the rebellion and to permanent peace lay through the re-election of 
                        Lincoln
                     and his Unionist associates. With the 
                        Fremont
                     movement on the verge of collapse, most of his supporters were drifting

                     over to the Lincoln standard.89 Although
                    this change in popular sentiment was becoming evident to Republican managers, they were still
                    anxious about the outcome of the elections. As one politician expressed it, "Our cause is
                    hopeful … and yet … the odds are against us."90
                    To counteract Democratic campaign tactics, Morton, Colfax and a dozen of the most prominent
                    Republicans wrote on September 12 to Secretary Stanton urging him to delay the draft until after the
                    election and to arrange for the return of at least fifteen thousand Indiana soldiers.91
            
            By the beginning of October the Republican campaigners had largely regained their confidence.92 They were attacking the "Copperheads" with increasing vigor
                    and defending the administrations of President 
                        Lincoln
                     and Governor Morton with genuine enthusiasm. In the October elections, the Union Party
                    easily re-elected Morton, regained control of the Legislature, and captured four additional
                    congressional seats—and all this despite the failure to secure the postponement of the
                    draft or the return of many soldiers. On November 8 the Indiana voters gave 
                        Lincoln
                     a twenty thousand majority over McClellan. This was a moderate gain over 1860 and real
                    comeback from the adverse vote of 1862. The most decided increase in the President's
                    supporters was in the central and the extreme southeastern sections of the state.93 Since 
                        Lincoln
                    's majority was practically equal to that of the popular Governor, it is
                    evident that relatively few Republicans voted against him, despite the criticism that he had
                    frequently received from them during his first term.94 Although most of the
                    newspapers attributed the victory chiefly to principles rather than personalities, yet some gave
                    considerable credit to the President's personal "hold on the affections and
                    confidence of the people."95
            
            
               
                  89 The shift began even before September. See

            Encouraged by such an impressive manifestation of popular confidence, 
                        Lincoln
                     soon exemplified the great politician by strengthening his hold upon those radical
                    Republicans who had given him a hesitant or reluctant vote. His forceful recommendation of a
                    constitutional amendment to abolish slavery throughout the nation enabled many strong anti-slavery
                    men to abandon their former lukewarmness toward him.96 His appointment of Chase
                    to be Chief Justice of the 
                        United States
                     was a politic move that met the practically unanimous approval of Hoosier
                        Republicans.97 Although Julian still opposed 
                        Lincoln
                    's moderate policies, he admitted that "Old Abe," through his
                    patronage, was "virtual dictator of the country."98 Most
                    important of all, during the early weeks of 1865, it became increasingly evident that the foundation
                    of the Confederacy was crumbling rapidly. These factors almost completely silenced criticism, even
                    from the radicals. Since military failure had been the most basic cause of Republican opposition,
                    the ultimate victory of the Union arms raised the 
                        Lincoln
                     Administration to the pinnacle of popularity.
            Unfortunately this situation was to be short-lived. The assassination of 
                        Lincoln
                     produced one of the most sudden and unique transformations ever to occur in American
                    public sentiment. Never before had the people of Indiana received such a horrible shock. Their
                    President had led them slowly but triumphantly through the greatest civil war in the history of the
                    world. They were just coming to realize what that leadership had meant. According to most
                    Republicans, "Mr. Lincoln enjoyed the confidence and love of the people to a greater extent
                    than any one upon whom the office of Chief Magistrate was ever conferred, and the regret at his
                    death was heightened by the fact that he had been stricken down in the midst of an unfinished
                        work."99 Virtually every editor and speaker attempted to analyze
                    his character and accomplishments; and some of these contemporary appraisals surpass many of those
                    made more recently. These men had gone with 
                        Lincoln
                     through a terrible ordeal; they knew both his

                    Journal typified this when it declared that, 
                        for kindness of heart, moderation verging on timidity, prudence bordering on hesitation, he
                            never had an equal since the great Republic started upon its career. Unassuming, yet truly
                            great, caring neither for old forms nor new rules, so that he did his duty; bowed down with
                            the burden of his own great thoughts, yet playful and approachable by any child; great among
                            the greatest, yet humble among the humblest—such ABRAHAM LINCOLN was.100
                  
                    
            
            Amidst this praise of the slain man the Hoosier Republicans began to turn against his program for
                    treatment of the conquered Confederates. They maintained that his plan was too mild and lenient,
                    that "justice" demanded sterner treatment of the unrepentant
                    "rebels." Even before his death, protests were current that there was
                    "great danger" of 
                        Lincoln
                     "being too generous just now, and overlooking and forgiving too
                        much."101 "Yet so great was" the
                    people's "confidence in his honesty, his judgement, and his patriotism, that they
                    acquiesced in whatever policy was adopted by him."102
            
            The assassination, however, not only removed the restraining hand of 
                        Lincoln
                     but also aroused the animosity and indignation of the Northern people to the greatest
                    intensity of the entire war. Some thought that 
                        Lincoln
                    's death was almost providential, that his work was
                    "accomplished," that a firmer executive was needed to "complete the great
                    task remaining' before use."103 Few Republicans were willing
                    now to uphold openly 
                        Lincoln
                    's mild policy towards the South. The radicals and most of the moderates
                    rejoiced therefore when President Johnson declared that justice demanded that rebel leaders should
                    suffer their due punishment.104 In their anger they called for "the
                    most relentless retribution"—"Death, Death, DEATH to
                        traitors!"105 The misguided masses of the South might be forgiven,
                    it was admitted. "But the Leaders! Let them Die!", proclaimed one aroused
                        editor.106 "Let the

                    the Hoosier Republicans were soon to join with others throughout the North in virtual repudiation of
                    much of the statesmanlike policy of the greatest man who had ever lived in Indiana. The tragedy of
                    assassination was to be followed by the tragedy of "Reconstruction."

            Indiana Historical Society
            CHRISTOPHER B. COLEMAN
            
            The list of members of the Indiana Historical Society in 1937, down to December 2, was published in
                    the December Indiana History Bulletin. Following this, the members of the Society
                    were asked to suggest others who ought to become members. Many suggestions were received and
                    invitations were sent to the addresses given. A very gratifying response has come from these
                    invitations. Thus far (January 24), sixty-seven have been elected to membership in the Society as a
                    result of these suggestions.
            This shows that there are many in Indiana, and many former residents of Indiana that now live outside
                    the state, who are ready to participate in the work and the opportunities of the Historical Society.
                    If the present members would continue to make it a point to send to the Secretary in the State
                    Library and Historical Building, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , nominations for membership, and would speak to others about the Society as opportunity
                    offers, the membership list could easily be increased to 1500 or 2000, greatly to the advantage of
                    historical interests in Indiana.
            The roster of the members in the December Indiana History Buletin reveals the fact
                    that 
                        Marion
                     County contains more than a third of the present members of the Society. Allen,

                        Wayne
                     counties seem to have a fair portion of members. It is a source of regret that no
                    members are reported from 
                        De Kalb
                    , La Grange, 
                  Ohio, Pulaski, Shelby

                     counties.
            Among the most valuable privileges of membership in the Society is the receipt of the quarterly Indiana Magazine of History published by Indiana University. The regular
                    subscription price is $2.00, the same amount as the annual membership dues of the
                    Society. The editor of the Magazine makes a generous offer to all high schools of
                    the state for the year 1938—that if four new memberships in the Society are secured in or
                    by any high school, a copy of the Magazine will be sent to the high school itself
                    without charge. The Magazine is one of the most interesting and important sources
                    of information  for Indiana history. It should be in every high
                    school library and a great many high schools of the state should avail themselves of this offer.
            In December, Number 2 of Volume I of the Prehistory Research Series was published,
                        Jacob Piatt Dunn: His Miami Language Studies and Indian Manuscript Collection,
                    by Caroline Dunn of the Indiana State Library; and, in January, Number 3 of Volume I, Shawnee Stems and the Jacob P. Dunn Miami Dictionary, Part I, Stems in p-, by C. F.
                    Voegelin of DePauw University. These are noticed elsewhere in the Magazine. It
                    should be noted that it is Dr. Voegelin's intention in Part I and the following parts of
                    his studies to publish the whole of the late Mr. Dunn's Miami Dictionary. Mr. Dunn left
                    this Dictionary in manuscript on cards arranged in the order English-Miami. Dr. Voegelin, a trained
                    philologist, is making a protracted study of the relaton of the languages and dialects spoken by
                    different Indian tribes, working especially with the stems. The order of publication, therefore, is
                    not Mr. Dunn's English-Miami order, but an order based on stems, and, for this purpose,
                    Shawnee stems have been chosen. Dr. Voegelin's Shawnee Stems and the Jacob P.
                        Dunn Miami Dictionary, being a technical study and of interest to a limited number of
                    scholars, is being mailed only to those requesting it. All members of the Historical Society are
                    entitled to regular publications of the Society without charge; they may obtain this by writing to
                    the Society, State Library and Historical Building, 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            The spring number (Volume 13, Number 1) of the Indiana Historical Society
                    Publications is Wylie J. Daniels' The Village at the End of the Road: A
                        Chapter in Early Indiana Railroad History, an illustrated account of the way in which
                    railroads were promoted in the period 1836 to 1853. Mr. Daniels takes the 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad as his particular theme. His account is based principally on contemporary
                    newspaper articles, many of which are not only interesting but spicy reading.
            A special publication of the Society is Prehistoric Antiquities of Indiana by Eli
                    Lilly, president of the Society. This is a large and profusely illustrated account of artifacts
                    found in Indiana, with introductory chapters giving a brief popular  account of the present state of our information about the Indians who
                    formerly lived in this part of the country. It is a sumptuous volume printed and bound by the
                    Lakeside Press, R. R. Donnelley and Sons Company. It has been sent to members of the Society; it is
                    for sale to others at five dollars a copy.
         
         
         
            History Teachers' Forum TEXT BOOKS IN AMERICAN HISTORY*
            
            There is a general course in American history in every high school and college in Indiana. This means
                    that a great many students are using texts that cover our history from the period of discovery and
                    exploration until some recent year. All of the high schools of the state use the same text, while
                    the history department of each college chooses for itself. It is of great importance that such texts
                    be accurate and well written, and it is of equal importance that they be used wisely. Better results
                    will flow from a poor text skillfully used and supplemented by a strong teacher, than from a fine
                    text in the hands of a bungling, weak instructor.
            There can be no two opinions in regard to the matter of accuracy. All are agreed that every effort
                    should be made to eliminate misstatements of fact. There will, of course, always be matter in any
                    text that further research will prove to be erroneous, but this does not excuse the authors of
                    school histories for perpetuating statements that have been proved to be untrue or for repeating
                    interpretations that have been demonstrated to be unsound. It is not necessary that a high school or
                    college text in history shall be written by one whose scholarship is widely recognized, but, if not,
                    the author should be one who has thoroughly checked his account by using the writings of those who
                    have done extensive research.
            It is likewise axiomatic that a text in history should be well written. This does not necessarily
                    mean that the narrative should be intensely interesting, but rather that the language should be
                    clear, the sentences smoothly constructed, and the matter well organized. An excellent book is
                    sometimes condemned because it does not impell students to read it by reason of the fascinating
                    manner in which the story is told. Teachers often voice this criticism, and frequently without
                    justification. There is no reason why any classes should be burdened with dull and clumsily written
                    texts in American history, and such volumes are very properly regarded with marked disfavor. On the
                    other hand, a well organized text, written in clear English by an author who knows his subject, is
                    often far superior to a text which presents the story in a 
                  
                     * This is the first of a series of four short articles
                            which will appear in this department during 1938, all relating to high school and college
                            texts in general courses in history.
               
                     more gripping style. After all, text books are written to be
                    studied, not just to be read. Any able teacher should get along well with a text that is rich in
                    content, which is, in fact, the most desirable quality that a high school or college history can
                    possess.
            One of the problems that confronts the writer of a history text is the great variation in library
                    facilities of the schools that may use the book when published. This fact is closely related to the
                    preparation of lists of references, questions, lesson plans, and suggestions for teachers. Possibly
                    such aids to study and teaching should be published separately from the history texts. This would
                    permit the publication of two pamphlets, one made up of references, suggestions and directions for
                    smaller schools and the other for larger schools. This would enable the authors and publishers to
                    furnish more suitable aids to teaching for use in both large and small schools.
            The best high school and college histories often fail signally in the matter of lists of references.
                    These lists are, it would seem, frequently made up by assistants of the authors and not inspected
                    closely enough. The lists published in numerous texts include too many dull, dry, out-of-date,
                    non-scholarly histories and biographies. Most high school and college students who can be prevailed
                    upon to do a considerable amount of collateral reading should not waste their time on biographies or
                    histories that have been superseded by far better works embodying the results of research done in
                    recent years. To give examples, there is hardly a high school or college text in American history
                    that does not give a blanket indorsement to the "Statesmen Series" of American
                    biography or to J. P. Gordy's Political History of the 
                            United States
                        , by including them in the chapter references or general bibliography without
                    comment. This would not be so bad if there were not so many omissions of more recent volumes that
                    are fresher and based on more extensive research. Teachers of history often order library books from
                    the lists of references included in history texts, and thus invest limited funds in inferior reading
                    matter when much better is available at no greater cost. There is apt to be valuable matter in older
                    biographies, monographs and large general works which students in advanced college courses may be
                    encouraged to cull out, but students taking high school courses or college students  taking general courses should not be asked to read antiquated histories
                    and biographies. The wise instructor who gives general courses in American History in high school or
                    college will not blindly follow the suggestions of the authors of text books, no matter how valuable
                    the content of such texts may be.

            FOURTEENTH INDIANA REGIMENT
            
            LETTERS TO THE VINCENNES WESTERN SUN
            The third series of letters written by Lieutenant William Landon of 
                        Vincennes
                    , who used the signature "Prock," were published in the Indiana Magazine of History for September, 1937. The series reprinted below is the fourth.
                    "Prock" was wounded in the Battle of Chancellorsville and was sent to a hospital
                    in 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., where he remained until the middle of October. He was in the hospital during the
                    period of the 
                        Gettysburg
                     campaign, and wrote no letters to the Sun from May 6 to October 24, 1863. The earlier
                    letters in the present series do not rank as high as those published in the issue of September,
                    1937, but the correspondence improves as the weeks pass and it has seemed best not to omit any
                    communication or delete any passages. "Prock" was severely wounded in the ankle on
                    May 10, 1864, and again sent to a hospital in 
                        Washington

                                    Friend Greene:
                                
                        Five months have filed past since our communications were cut off. It seems about as
                                    many weeks, time flies so rapidly. 
                                        It seems as but a single moment fled;
                                        But fortune's dame has mix'd with skill adroit.
                                        The pain and pleasures through which we are led;
                                        How swift an hour glides by, if we enjoy it!
                                        She'll pour out happiness and then alloy it,
                                        As dairymen do their milk, or baker's bread.
                                        Thus, when we think we've got about the thing,
                                        We "cuss" to find how little joy 'twill bring.
                                        "There is no rest for the wicked."
                                        " `Tis ever thus in the dark world of sorrow,"
                                        Which words are copied, as you might suppose.
                                        In fact, religious cant I like to borrow,
                                        It calms my conscience much, the devil knows.
                                        
                                 
                                    * Lieutenant William Landon joined the
                                                Army again in December, 1864. He wrote no further letter to the Western Sun until July 1, 1865. (See the Sun for July 7, 1865.) In the meantime his friends in 
                                                    Vincennes
                                                 seem to have lost track of him. Even the editor of the Sun was unable to answer the many anxious inquiries
                                                received in regard to "Prock" until the arrival of the
                                                letter written in camp on July 1, 1865. (See news item, Sun, July 7, 1865.) A final series of the letters of
                                                Lieutenant Landon will be reprinted in a future issue. After the Civil
                                                War, he joined the Regular Army with the rank of Second Lieutenant.

                                       Leavenworth, Kansas
                                     in the summer of 1866, he disappeared
                                                from camp and was not seen again. It was not until February, 1867, that
                                                news of the disappearance reached

                                                National House, to the effect that Lieut. Landon was supposed to have
                                                drowned while bathing in the Missouri River on July

                                                Western Sun, Oct. 31, 1863. The village of Greenwich
                                                was about ten miles northeast of Warrenton, 
                                                    Virginia
                                                , and about thirty-five miles southwest of

                                        Now, how is this, can anybody tell?
                                        One-half the world prefer to worship evil,

                        I am just down to the "Front" from 
                                        Washington
                                    , D.C., where I have been on "sick leave." I will not
                                    attempt in this homely scrawl to give "in full description each
                                    adventure"—time enough for that "When this cruel war is
                                    over," but nevertheless will jot down a few items of what I saw in the
                                    Amedican Sodom.
                        A looker on one afternoon at a game of "base ball" played on the
                                    grounds of the National B. B. Club, directly in the rear of the White House, I heard
                                    every few seconds the report of firearms, and soon perceived Father Abraham engaged
                                    in target practice. The weapon used was a smooth-bore, load at the breech, with the
                                    largest cock I ever saw on any piece, although it kicked unmercifully. The
                                    Rail-Splitter done some tall shooting, and "plumbed the center"
                                    several times, which seemed to tickle him prodigiously. The target used was one of
                                    his proclamations—the center of this "Bull's
                                    eye" being a "little joke."
                        Obtaining a pass from Col. Baker, I visited the old Capitol prison, and a sight the
                                    inside of that box was, sure enough; Barnum's Museum is `no whar'.
                                    A motley crew of all ages, sizes, and colors, from every State in the Union and (at
                                    present) out; also the territories. There were civilians and soldiers of Yankeeland
                                    and Dixie, and a "right smart sprinklin" of Sambo. Europe was
                                    represented by some hard-looking chaps, among others I particularly noticed a
                                    Spaniard, that from his demoniac look, no doubt entered upon his career of crime by
                                    cutting the throat of his mother. In the female department were two persimmon-eaters
                                    from

                                    , dressed in the style of '76, waist two inches below the arm
                                    pits, no hoops, hair a la Indian squaw, snuff colored teeth, deep set, grey eyes,
                                    keen as a falcon's, long finger nails; I thought of tendering the use of my
                                    knife to pare the claws but was actually afraid to. What a magnificent pair of hawks
                                    were spoiled. The biggest one having eyed me savagely, asked, "Kin you give
                                    me a chew bacca, Cap?" "Don't use the weed that
                                    way." "Spile his kimplexun to chaw; ain't he a buty,
                                    Judy?" Laughing like a hyena, Judy broke out with—"What
                                    are ye sassin the d—–d conscript for, Malviny? he's
                                    pius he is, a regular Yankee sirkit rider, cired by that infernal thief John 
                                        Brown
                                    ; yer a fule ter waste breth on sich like. Give me yer snuff-box
                                    here." I left the lovely Judy preparing for a "dipping"
                                    and humming the `Bonnie Blue Flag.'
                        The Navy Yard has many objects of interest, amongst others four cannon captured by
                                    Capt. Stephen 
                                        Decatur
                                     in 1812; and the guns of the rebel ram Merrimac. Uncle Sam's
                                    work shops, foundries, &c., coming in for a large share of the
                                    visitor's curiosity.
                        The Arsenal is a delightful place to pass a summer afternoon. At the farther end of
                                    the long shaded walk a bright brass twelve-pound howitzer stares you in the face. It
                                    formerly belonged to Bragg's Battery, and was one of the "dogs of
                                    war" that sent a "little more grape" into the Mexican
                                    ranks at 
                                        Buena Vista
                                    . It was the hour for practice, and Col. Hotchkiss, inventor of the
                                    celebrated Hotchkiss shell, what soldiers call "hell screamers,"
                                    was testing the qualities of his invention  (with
                                    an improvement) out of a thirty pound Parrott. 'Tis much more interesting,
                                    though not as exciting, to hear the shriek of these missiles when you are a
                                    spectator and not the target.
                        From the National Observatory, with the excellent spy-glass for use of visitors,
                                    there is a magnificent view of 
                              Washington, Georgetown
                           , and their surroundings. Innumerable forts,
                                    camps, hospitals, &c., also the winding of the Potomac with 
                                        Alexandria
                                     in the distance. The tower, twenty feet in diameter,
                                    revolves—inside this is a huge telescope, and many other astronomical
                                    instuments. At ten minutes to twelve o'clock (noon), a black ball three
                                    feet in diameter is hoisted to the top of the flag-staff, visible all over both
                                    cities, and at twelve o'clock—"correct
                                    time"—it is lowered quickly. Towards noon you can hear citizens
                                    enquire if the "nigger head" is up yet. The porter at this place
                                    is an "intelligent contraband." I mean, really so, and amused me
                                    not a little with the account of his flight to Abraham's bosom.
                                    "Suffered 'mazingly, Cap'n, winter fore las, cummin fru
                                    the wilderness from ole 
                                        Richmond
                                    —hope never to see dat place agin; fore God I do!"
                                    Very likely his tale was a gotten up thing.
                        There are eight classes of buildings composing the hole of 
                                        Washington
                                     (for a hole it is, taken all in all, and a dirtier, filthier city there
                                    is not on this continent, I hope). Public buildings, hotels, restaurants,
                                    boarding-houses (two meals only each day, hash and liver, the hash eaters paying
                                    $7 per week!) boarding-houses, station-houses, guardhouses, musical and
                                    other halls, including one what is known as the "Island" Hall encompassed by a wall that is both strong
                                    and tall, and that ain't all! Most of the private houses in the city were
                                    owned by the secesh and have been confiscated, the Government using them for
                                    offices, &c.
                        
                           
                                        California
                                     prices in '49 were cheap compared to the exorbitant demands
                                    made here for the necessaries of life—and everything
                                    else—in this the year of our Lord 1863. There is a difference of at
                                    least fifty per cent, between this city and 
                                        Baltimore
                                    . All the principal hotels purchase their edibles in the latter place.
                        Although there is a heavy police force, assisted by a mounted and foot patrol of the
                                    Provost Guard, and two corps of detectives, still the daily criminal record equals
                                    in length that of 
                                        New York
                                     City. Murder is a common thing and of nightly occurrence; indeed this
                                    place in many respects would compare favorably with the capitol of Brigham
                                    Young's dominions. Would you believe it? There is in this city a Maj. Gen.
                                    who is also a Justice of the Peace, and receives his "little old"
                                    fifty cent paper rag2 for administering the "oath of
                                    office" to officers with apparently as much nonchalance as he would take
                                    the "oath" himself "without any water and with a little
                                    sugar."
                        We left 
                                        Washington
                                     City last Tuesday week3—arrived in camp
                                    on the east side of Bull Run Creek, Friday night, in the midst of a tremendous
                                    rain-storm. Next afternoon we waded the creek, waist deep, and deployed as
                                    skirmishers, protected the flanks of a cavalry advance 
                              
                                 2 Paper money included fractional currency with face
                                            values of fifty cents, twenty-five cents, and ten cents, at the time of and
                                            for a number of years after the Civil War.
                              
                                 3 Oct. 16, 1863.

                                             and 
                                                Alexandria
                                             R. R.
                           
                                     —coming back at sundown, wet as
                                    drowned rats. Monday at daybreak we left camp and Bull Run behind, marched through
                                    Manasses to Bristow Station, O. & A.R.R.4 and next day
                                    from there to this place. Our corps having the advance, only waded Broad Run three times in one day (yesterday). The water was comfortably
                                    cold, I thank you!
                        Edward Dehan, private Co. G, was taken prisoner whilst on picket, and has gone to 
                                        Richmond
                                     in advance of Meade's army.
                        We shall probably leave here early to-morrow. How far we are at present from
                                    Warrington I can't say—not far, however.5
                        
                        We are using up the last rails on this route, and I pity the army that marches
                                    through here in cold weather, if any should. Persimmons and fresh made graves
                                    abound—the former in profusion, and 'tis all there is left in
                                    this American desert to eat.

                                    Wednesday, Nov. 6, 1863.6
                           
                                
                        
                                    Friend Greene:
                                
                        Our encampment is about four miles east of Warrenton, on the W. J. R. R.7 The weather has been delightful, but it can't last
                                    long—even now Heaven's artillery is rumbling, and stormy times
                                    are near at hand.
                        Our sutler came up last night with a huge supply of "Old Scotch
                                    Ale" and Sherry. There was a lively and happy time in camp for a spell, I
                                    assure you.
                        The woods in our rear took fire this P.M. and burned fiercely until the 
                                        New York
                                     Garabildi Guards, sent out as skirmishers, put down the destructive
                                    element.
                        Stones abound all over this God forsaken State; at this particular spot not a square
                                    foot of the "sacred soil" is visible. They are in great demand
                                    just now for building chimneys to our rag houses. We have a fine supply of rails
                                    from the neighboring farms of rebellious Virginians. Company quarters throughout the "
                                        Gibraltar
                                     Brigade" are heaped with 'em, piled high. To-day an
                                    order came from the Provost Marshal General to return the
                                    "splinters" instanter. When the regimental wagons drove up to haul
                                    'em back, 'twas discovered that not a whole rail
                                    was there to be found in the numerous heaps. The old brigade was not to be cheated
                                    out of their favorite fuel—won't freeze, if it does turn cold,
                                    not they. There are not five axes in our regiment and those we have are worthless.
                                    How in the devil does the Provost Marshal General A. P.8 suppose
                                    we could obtain wood? I am always in favor of burning Old Virginny
                                    rails—love to see the greedy flames lick 'em
                                    up—cannot be excelled for fuel, and in fact 'tis the only
                                    "Greek Fire" we of the A.P. can use on the rebels—at
                                    present.

                        A few good fellows from the 14th were sent home to "winter," and
                                    try their luck at recruiting. Lucky boys! They deserve their good fortune. The

                                    Meredith, was sent home.

                                    sweetly slumber now "arter" January 5th, '64. They will
                                    be keeping constant and unwearied vigils (like a picket on a dangerous out-post) on
                                    the look out for ye draft!
                        It tickles us old soldiers all over. Aye, "muchly," it does! I hope
                                    Abe and Congress will "rub out" the $300 clause9 and substitutes go up to a big figure, and "more
                                    too." Say one, two, and five thousand "shads!" Wagh! Come
                                    out of the "long grass!" Go for 'em, Father Abraham! The
                                    stars and stripes are bound to fly high, must win now. No alternative. The rebellion
                                    must be crushed, for the honor of the Nation and the old flag are at stake. Cost
                                    what it may, the "Dixie Land" must be reclaimed. Long marches,
                                    rain, sleet, snow, starvation for twenty-four and forty-eight hours; heat, thirst,
                                    smoke, dust, "hard tack," camp coffee, "salt
                                    junk," and "salt horse" will soon teach most any man to
                                    fight. Come forth, Draft! Say I.

                        Should relish some of the game you folks at home have furnished you in such profusion
                                    at this season of the year—squirrel, quail, and fat duck. The
                                    "General" was always h—–1 on ducks. I learn he lost his last month's pay playing
                                    "freeze-out" poker in

                                     on last Thanksgiving day. The old sinner! may he live till he freezes

                                    Dear Greene:
                                
                        We broke up camp near Kelly's Ford, Rappahannock river, early on the morning
                                    of the 26th of November, and sunrise found us miles away toward Germania Ford, on
                                    the Rapid Ann. We crossed without opposition at 3 o'clock that afternoon
                                    and bivouacked in a dense pine and cedar thicket; 'twas a clear, cold
                                    night, and the bright, full moon made all things glisten with her pure silver rays.
                                    Aroused by the shrill bugle at 4 A.M., we pushed forward briskly and drove in the
                                    Rebel pickets at 6 o'clock. A portion of the 14th, under command of First
                                    Lieut. Geo. Rotramel, of Co. F., with a detail from the 8th 
                              
                                 9 A clause providing that drafted men might pay for

                                            Western Sun, Dec. 19, 1863.
                           
                                    
                                    
                                        Ohio
                                     and 7th Va., were thrown forward as skirmishers, and a lively fusilade
                                    was soon opened. The "Johnny's" held their ground for
                                    some time, bat reinforcements were thrown forward, a charge made, and the
                                    "Rebs" fell back a short distance; 'twas
                                    "pop!" "pop!" for about four hours, our
                                    artillery pitching over an occasional shell. We lay on a high ridge and looked on.
                                    At 3 o'clock, P.M., the 7th Va. and 8th 
                                        Ohio
                                     made a charge and drove the "Johnnys" half a mile,
                                    but they still maintained an unbroken line and kept up their fire. 'Twas a
                                    "panorama" for us fellows, as we could see every man
                                    engaged—every gun fired.
                        After dark extra ammunition was issued, and the 14th moved out to our skirmish line
                                    and relieved the 7th 
                                        Virginia
                                    —the night was cloudy and bitter cold; we lay behind an old
                                    rail fence all night—no fires, of course. At early dawn our line moved
                                    forward and found the "Johnnys" had retired during the night. On
                                    we went in line for two miles through thickets, dark pine-woods and fields of
                                    stubble; four "Rebs" were captured, and at 7 o'clock we
                                    found the "Johnnys" strongly posted, on a steep hill, formidable
                                    earth-works and a strong line of skirmishers on a low ridge, some five hundred yards
                                    in front, awaiting our approach.
                        I never saw a more imposing sight—the red battle-flags, with the large
                                    white cross in the centre, flying—a long, dark column of men, their
                                    bright arms gleaming in the morning sun—the dark and frowning muzzles of
                                    eighteen or twenty pieces of artillery, and all as quiet and still as though not a
                                    soul but the once peaceful and happy inhabitants of the valley were near.
                        Our Brigade bugle sounded—"Halt!" And the two armies
                                    stood and gazed at each other for several moments. I could hear the artillery
                                    rumbling in our rear, and the steady tramp of our gallant boys of the 3rd Division
                                    (our support). "Forward! Double quick!" screamed the
                                    bugle—and we smashed into the skirmish line and drove it back. Bang!
                                    Bang! bang! whiz! whack! a rebel battery had opened on us. "Lie
                                    down!" blew the bugle, and down we went in the tall grass, willows and
                                    along the fence rows—some behind a house and out buildings that lay
                                    between the opposing forces; there we lay all day long and popped away. The distance
                                    to the rebel lines was about seven hundred yards, or perhaps not over four, on an
                                        air line.
                        
                        An attack in force was not contemplated, it seems, but we did not then and there know
                                    that. Several men wounded in the sharp shooting that day, and not a man but had
                                    scores of narrow escapes; the "Gibralters" ransacked the house
                                    from top to bottom, though bullets were whacking against and through it all day.
                                    Your correspondent had a huge piece of bread and butter for his dinner.
                        At night we were relieved. It had rained hard part of the afternoon and we were glad
                                    to fall back and cook supper.
                        Aroused at 4 A.M. we marched all day, away down to the rebels' right
                                    wing—arrived there just at sun down and found the
                                    "Johnnys" coming in, too, on a double quick, in front of us. Their
                                    battery gave us and the setting sun a parting salute for the day. We threw up a
                                    fence rail breastwork, and without fire lay down to sleep; 'twas a very
                                    severe night—a heavy frost, and we exposed on a bare hill in a  large field; but little sleep any of us got, though we
                                    were tired enough. In front of us lay a dead soldier of the 1st division, shot
                                    through the brain—their skirmishers had preceded us.
                        Monday, Nov. 30th, aroused at 3 A.M.—formed line of
                                    battle—three lines rather; we were in the second line;
                                    moved up within about six hundred yards of the rebel works; stacked arms and piled
                                    knapsacks. The orders were that there would be a grand charge of 28,000 men at 8
                                    o'clock. A narrow cedar-covered ridge hid us from view of the rebels. In
                                    advance of this strong line of our skirmishers were deployed. 8 o'clock
                                    came—no bugle sounded the charge. Gen. 
                                        Warren
                                    , our corps commander, rode along the lines; everybody was busily
                                    engaged in trying to keep from freezing, pacing quickly up and down. By noon most of
                                    us had crept to the top of the ridge and obtained a full view of the work and works before us. The charge would have resulted in another 
                                        Fredericksburg
                                    —all agree on that. Even as savage and reckless as all had
                                    become, consequent on hunger, cold and exposure, it would have been impossible to
                                    carry and hold those works. At 7 P.M. we fell back half a mile;
                                    next day threw up entrenchments and lay, behind them till 8 P.M., when the "

                                    "skee-daddle" for the Rapid Ann [Rapidan]. All night long we
                                    marched—along side of us the 3rd Corps—no halt—and
                                    at sun rise Wednesday, Dec. 2nd, recrossed that river at Ellis', or
                                    Culpeper Gold Mine ford. 'Twas a hard march of about twenty-two miles.
                        These gold mines were worked up to within about twelve months since. On the river
                                    bank there is quite an extensive establishment for washing, &c., with all
                                    the washers and other mining implements scattered around. A "Union
                                    man" and his family, living here, crossed to the north side with us;
                                    'tis the first opportunity he has had of escaping from the
                                    "Johnny" Confederacy.
                        Breakfast two miles from the river—then pushed on to this, our old camp,
                                    reaching it weary and foot-sore at dusk—distance marched since 8
                                    o'clock of the previous evening, 32 miles, with knapsacks, and a good part
                                    of the time four columns abreast—and it must be remembered over old 
                                        Virginia
                                     roads.
                        Thursday, Dec. 3d—obtained some boards and put up a
                                    shanty—orders to build "winter quarters."
                        Friday, Dec. 4th—Orderly Gundrum and I worked hard all day and nearly
                                    finished a fire-place and chimney to our log hut. Orders to march at daylight.
                        Saturday, Dec. 5th—Marched as per orders. After traveling about 3 miles,
                                    reached the miserable village of Stevensburg, about five miles south-west of Brandy
                                    Station, 0. and A. and Culpeper R. R., and the same distance south-east of the town
                                    of Culpeper. We halted in a dirty, filthy, old cavalry camp—no wood, no
                                    water, no nothing; in fact, 'tis a h—–1 of a place,
                                    and colder than 
                                        Greenland
                                    . The distance from Morton's ford, Rapid Ann river, is about
                                    four miles.
                        I am writing in the cold, and am not in the best of humor either, I assure you.
                        We are under orders to be ready to move at short notice. Oh!  for a stiff "snifter" of
                                    "Old Bourbon?" I never told you that to obtain a canteen full of
                                    the U. S. A. miserable, stinking, "commissary" whiskey an officer
                                        (even the Col. of a regiment), has to get an order approved at
                                    brigade headquarters! That is a fact. Nothing goes according to the Regulations in
                                    this Army of the Potomac. "General orders" having superceded the Regulations, rendering even the revised copies entirely
                                    useless.
                        The "Black Swan," it seems, has turned up in the Old
                                    Post—fifty dollars a night, only! Does her singing equal that of
                                    "Potato Rot," the "Irish Biddy" of
                                    Fife's Theatre?
                        I had forgotten to mention that the only loss sustained by our regiment in the
                                    weeks' campaign south of the Rapid Ann, was, 1st Lieut. Geo. Rotramel, Co.
                                    F., a brave officer, a gentleman in every sense of the word, and a comrade beloved
                                    by all. He was mortally wounded near Locust Grove or Robertson's farm,
                                    where the first skirmishing commenced. Thos. Piety, of Co. G, was one of the detail
                                    under command of Lt. Rotramel, and although this two-hundred and five pound six-feet
                                    two inches high corporal was closely "nipped" several times by
                                    rebel bullets, he escaped unhurt.
                        All the farms south of the Rapid Ann were laid waste, and the inhabitants made
                                    acquainted with the "cruel war" and the "thieving
                                    Yankees"—guess there is "weeping and wailing and
                                    gnashing of teeth" over there now.
                        I wish I could re-write this letter. I would endeavor to make it more interesting;
                                    'tis a scrawl gotten up under difficulties, and no mistake. So with a
                                    hearty wish for the welfare of all at home, and the hope that the
                                    "General" will not invest in Swan's down because
                                    'tis fashionable.

                                    down" in a huge hollow, with a dense pine and cedar thicket in front to
                                    keep the west wind off, and a forest of heavy timber in the rear. Hail columbia!
                                    What a din of axes and crashing of falling timber on all sides! The Western boys are
                                    adapts at "blocking up" shanties in a hurry. We all felt at home
                                    when the arms were stacked beneath the tall chestnut oaks, the camp staked off, and
                                    orders issued to build "winter quarters"—whilst the
                                    axe-men were making the chips fly, others were carrying stone for chimneys and
                                    splashing the "sacred-soil" over the "chinks."
                                    Tools were scarce enough; 'twould have astonished them at home to see men
                                    quarrying rock with bayonets only, and what comfortable quarters a couple of the
                                    veterans can put up in two days with a dull hatchet. One and all worked with a will
                                    and now we are comfortably housed for the winter, unless Lee concludes to

                                    and git" before warm weather.
                        Sergeants Gundrum and Wicks, with your correspondent, are sitting to-night in a snug
                                    "hotel" with a parlor, bed-room, fire and kitchen all in the same
                                    room. We are comfortable, I thank you—and having disposed of supper with
                                    a soldier's appetite, indulged in a big smoke out of my Cheat Mountain
                                    pipe, and whiled away an hour waiting for the mail and playing dominoes with the
                                    boys, I thought 'twould interest friends at home to read a few camp items.

                                    getting ten—they being so much nearer home. Those who failed to obtain
                                    leaves and furloughs last winter and spring will be allowed to go
                                    first—two commissioned officers and four enlisted men at a time from the
                                    14th. Col. S. S. Carrol has gone to 
                                        Washington
                                     City, and Col. Coons commands the Brigade. Lt. James 
                                        Caldwell
                                    , of Co. "A," (14th), has been appointed recruiting
                                    officer for the regiment, to ascertain how many of the "veterans"
                                        present will re-enlist for "three years or during the
                                    war." Can't say how many will "go
                                    in"—probably not many—the boys most all want to have
                                    a "4th of July" at home, and that 4th the next 4th
                                        too!
                        
                        Major General William S. French, formerly our Division commander, now in command of
                                    the 3d Corps, ordered some time since a new set of arms for this
                                    regiment—breech loading rifles—a high compliment to the
                                    Hoosiers, who never forget to cheer their brave old commander when by chance he
                                    passes along their line. The arms are now in 
                                        Washington
                                    , awaiting shipment. The boys will be proud of their new guns and our
                                    recruiting officers at home had better drill their squads of one
                                    or more in the breech-loading exercise. Not an unpleasant task for 'em, I
                                    fancy.
                        We are blessed with a most extraordinary "spell" of fine weather
                                    just now, and excellent rations too—vegetables, such as onions and
                                    potatoes in abundance. These were much needed by the men after their long diet on
                                    "marching rations" of crackers and pork. Verily the commissariat
                                    must have fallen into new and honest hands. The
                                    "robbers" have had their day—this Brigade has suffered
                                    its full share from d—–d rascals in the commissary department.
                                    Hurrah for the change! Sutlers are here by the gross, with heaps of
                                    "goodies," &c.—their prices as usual up to the
                                    top notch—would frighten any but a soldier or resident of 
                                        Washington
                                     City. Butter 75 cts per lb.; eggs 60 cts per dozen; cheese 50 cts per
                                    lb.; fresh "sassage" (horse meat probably, with a mixture of
                                    dog-steak and hair) 40 cts per lb.; green apples 25 cts per hand-full.

                                    looking peddlers, heretofore the greatest nuisance in this army, no longer flock
                                    into our camps from 
                                        Washington
                                     and

                                    the Eleventh corps has rid us entirely of the rogues. I'll wager a
                                    month's pay there is not a score of this class in the ranks of the Army of the Potomac. Then why 
                                    should they be allowed to fleece the soldiers of their hard-earned dollars? I

                        I have learned by your paper of the death of Hon. James Dick, and am grieved to hear
                                    of the fact. To me, who served eighteen months as clerk in his office, Mr. Dick was
                                    always the same urbane, courteous, kindhearted old gentleman—true as
                                    steel to those whom he honored with his friendship.—Requies

                        Twelve months ago this night we of the Fourteenth Indiana were quartered in the fine
                                    brick dwellings on Caroline street in the city of 
                                        Fredericksburg
                                    , Va.—ransacking, pillaging, feasting, fiddling, dancing, and
                                    having a gay time generally, as soldiers will have whenever opportunity offers, even
                                    though it be on the eve of a great battle and under the very guns of the enemy. Forty-two answered to "roll call" that night in
                                    Co. "G." "Tattoo" brought but eighteen together this evening on the same side of the
                                    Rappahannock. Two years ago tonight the same drum call summoned ninety men to answer to their names or be placed on "extra guard
                                    duty;" then we were stuck down in mud unfathomable near Huttonville,
                                    Western 
                                        Virginia

                                    "company mess called the "Tiger Tails"—we
                                    numbered nineteen—seven are still with the regiment, a merry mess we
                                    were, and well remembered will be the days and nights passed in our cozy
                                    "Sibley."
                        Mr. John Rotramel, brother of Lt. George Rotramel, of Co. "F."
                                    arrived in camp from 
                                        Carlisle
                                    , Ia. [Ind.] yesterday. He is here for the purpose of obtaining the
                                    remains of his brother. 'Tis extremely doubtful whether Gen. Lee will allow
                                    a flag of truce so far within his lines for that purpose. The Lieuto lies buried
                                    some twelve or fifteen miles south of the Rapid Ann.
                        Here are two incidents that occurred during our last "raid" into
                                    Dixie that may prove worth publishing:—two soldiers, one of the 7th and
                                    the other of the 14th Indiana, were pulling heads of cabbages from a hole in the
                                    garden right on our skirmish line at Mine Run. The 7th Hoosier being nearest to the
                                    "fruit," had several fine cabbage unearthed when the bullet of a
                                    rebel sharpshooter broke his leg. He begged most piteously to be carried out of
                                    "range" but hungry-for-greens Hoosier No. 2 couldn't see
                                    it, and grabbing the pile of vegetables, made off on double quick for a safer
                                    locality.
                        As we were hurrying along about midnight, Tuesday, Dec. 1st, two corps side by side,
                                    on the Chancellorsville plank road, making for the Rapid Ann, a soldier
                                    "belonging to some regiment in the Sd corps stumbled and came down on the
                                    rough hard planks with a tremendous thump, his gun clattering after him. The poor
                                    devil fairly bounced again, so quick and heavy was the fall. A dozen comrades were
                                    compelled to trample over him, going at the rate we all were, before he could regain
                                    his feet. I heard a wide-awake and always ready "Knutt" in the
                                    14th sing out—"What the devil are you laying down there
                                    for?" The re joiner consigned the 14th man to a very warm corner in
                                    Lucifer's dominions. Devilish little sympathy soldiers have for
                                    unfortunates—especially when on the go. I hear some speculating soldier
                                    crying—"Here's your fresh oysters, only
                                    $1.10 cts per half can!" 
                                    Guess I'll invest and have a mighty stew for breakfast. All things in

                        We are in the midst of mud unfathomable, and Old Winter has fairly settled down upon
                                    us. Many changes have taken place in the regiment since last I wrote—the
                                    "Veteran Volunteer" excitement had its day, and a "heavy
                                    run," too! Some sixty of as "good and true" men as the
                                    14th can boast of re-enlisted for the war. The inducements held out to old soldiers
                                    were indeed great, and such as no government ever offered before. The bounty was
                                    liberal in the extreme; in fact, taken altogether, four hundred and two dollars and
                                        thirty days at home, with free transportation to and from, was a "big thing," and no
                                    mistake. We have some fifty or sixty men whose term of service does not expire for
                                    twelve months to come, so the probability is the organization will remain intact,
                                    and our decimated ranks filled "chock up" with ye conscripts.

                        A rough night, in sleet and snow, on picket, suggested the above. Duty is rougher,
                                    tougher, and more of it this winter than ever before. The Line officers of our
                                    regiment are on duty every other day, and the men relieved from guard at 10 A.M.
                                    to-day are detailed for fatigue at 6 A.M. to-morrow. The division has a
                                    "task" to perform in the line of road making—that
                                    thoroughly Western style familiarly known as
                                    "Corderoy"—-and a task it proves, indeed. You should
                                    hear the storm of yells, hoots, and curses on all roads in general and those in 
                                        Virginia
                                     in particular, bestowed by the fatigue detail of the "

                                    numbers one hundred or ten hundred, they have the same amount of guard and fatigue
                                    duty to perform, so we all join most heartily in the cry— 
                                        "Father Abraham, hurry up the Cons."
                                    
                        
                        Prock indulged in a "few stew"—hot—on Christmas eve, and for dinner Christmas day there were
                                    served up a brace of attenuated and most ancient fowls of the Shanghai breed, that
                                    cost me two dollars, and my cook all his stock of patience before they were ready

                                     during the intervals with infinite relish, he at
                                    last broke out, with: 
                                        "Lieutenant, de fac is, dese injun-rubber cocks, dat crowed for ole

                        Nevertheless, a few more nips and a fresh supply of chips on the fire, compelled the
                                    "spring chickens" to drap to pieces, and for once the soldier had
                                    for his Christmas dinner "chicken fixins."
                        The holidays passed off quietly enough. I hope those of 1864 will prove more jovial
                                    and interesting to my comrades of the 14th.

                                    short, a merry trip after all.
                        Capt. Patterson returned to the regiment yesterday.
                        We have buried two of our comrades in the hostile soil of Old 
                                        Virginia
                                     since we pitched this camp. One, McDonald, of Company K, and the other,
                                    Welch, of Company D. The former was stabbed to the heart in a broil with a messmate,
                                    and although his heart was almost completely severed in twain, he lived forty-five minutes, and actually walked some thirty yards! The latter died
                                    in regimental hospital, and was buried yesterday during a driving snow storm. These
                                    are the only burials that have taken place in the 14th (whilst encamped) since we
                                    left the dilapidated tents and sod-chimneys of our camp at Huttonville, on the banks
                                    of the Tygart, in Western 
                                        Virginia
                                    .
                        I received one New Year's gift—a bottle of "Irish
                                    whiskey"—from Lieut. A. M. 
                                        Van
                                     Dyke, now on Gen. Webb's staff. He goes home on the
                                    "short fifteen" in a few days. May he enjoy the trip hugely.
                        I forgot to mention the names of Company G's "Veterans:"
                                    Corporal Wm. Linn and privates James Dolan, Pearson D. Rodgers, and Asher W. Foster.
                                    The remainder of the Company present are all "June Bugs."
                        I see that Mrs. Mary Ann Onderdonk has her "pictur" and somewhat
                                    eventful history in the second of January number of the "National Police
                                    Gazette," under the heading—"A Widow in
                                    Distress." If I am not much mistaken, 
                                        Vincennes

                                    would say. The ubiquitous history of the "lady fair" richly repays
                                    perusal.
                        I must return thanks to my comrade, Sergeant Colman, now at home, for many favors
                                    through Uncle Sam's "U. S. Army Mail." Should he fail in
                                    enlisting any recruits for Company "G," 14th, I do hope and trust
                                    he will not only thoroughly recruit his health, but likewise conscript for life some
                                    fair damsel of the Old Post.
                        How about that "railroad" name-sake o' mine? Does he wear
                                    a wig? Is he totally in favor of
                                    "punches"—hot and spicy—of Scotch whisky?
                                    Can he sing when in the midst of difficulties? For instance—if lodged in
                                    a square two-story building, built of "granite so gray," and
                                    sitting "forninst" the "Ten of Diamonds," gazing
                                    at the "last rays of the setting sun and the solitary
                                    horse-man"—a sentinel guarding the  "oaken" door—himself
                                    incarcerated for shooting a Johnny's fowls instead of the
                                    d—–d rebel himself—I repeat, could he, under such
                                    circumstances, himself be the victim of fowl play, [and] plaintively warble? as did Prock once on a time— 
                                        I cannot live always,
                                        I wish not to stay.
                                     If he pleads not guilty to any of these "ups and downs"
                                    of life—refuses to "shoot folly as it flies—commits
                                    no "faux pas" or miss'dmeanors—knows nothing of these things, nor of
                                    "them things," and "can't see
                                    it"—then he is a bogus

                                    February 9, 1864.13
                           
                                
                        
                                    Friend Greene:
                                
                        Saturday morning, 6th inst., cold, raw, and drizzling, found us with blankets slung,
                                    three days' rations, and in rapid motion toward the Rapid Ann, which stream
                                    we forded, waist deep, at noon. Wagh! Cold is no name for it.
                        The Third Brigade of our Division had the advance, and a warm time of it they were
                                    having with the "Johnnys" as we crossed. As we advanced to their
                                    support, the enemy shelled us briskly. The river was too deep and swift for our
                                    artillery to cross, and we had no pontoons. However, the big guns lent us all the
                                    aid in their power from the north bank, and Capt. Arnold's battery of
                                    twelve pound howitzers delivered regular (as the boys say) "vollies of
                                    six-pounders," but the "Johnnys" knowing their advantage,
                                    after three brigades were across, opened a tremendous fire on us from their
                                    artillery and made a charge—but the Third Brigade stood their ground
                                    manfully, and were not to be driven easily from their position. We being their
                                    support, caught it heavily—the regiment losing fifteen killed and wounded
                                    without a chance of returning a shot. Long after dark the opposing lines continued
                                    the contest, the bright flashes from their guns presenting in the deepening gloom a
                                    splendid sight, though the contents of at least one-half of those iron tubes
                                    whistling, humming, and "nipping" around was, to say the least,
                                    unpleasant.
                        At 10 o'clock we withdrew to the north bank, lay down in the mud, wet
                                    through, and chilled to the very bone. Spent the day Sunday in watching the
                                    "Johnnys" across the "drink" [river], and the
                                    compliments of the season exchanged by the hostile batteries. At night, returned to
                                    camp through unfathomable mud, over stumps and stones, stumbling and cursing along
                                    in one of the darkest of dark nights.
                        Corporal Thos. Piety, of Co. G, was wounded in the right foot on the advance skirmish
                                    line.
                        Lieut. Andrews, of Co. B, had his belt clasp perforated by a bullet, which, passing
                                    through his coat, pants, drawers, and shirt bruised his abdomen severely, but most
                                    fortunately lost its penetrating power when it reached the flesh.
                        It is very unhealthy on the south bank of the Rapid Ann, and one runs great risk of
                                    his life in penetrating the country to any extent; 
                              
                                 13

                                     nevertheless, he becomes accustomed to the
                                    climate after a few trips, and reckless of the consequences.
                        Our reconnoisance proved conclusively that the "Johnnys" are still
                                    there, and ready to receive us; and furthermore, that they are in force. Guess when
                                    we pass that way in the spring, the blue jackets will make the greyhounds leave
                                    their kennels howling.
                        I will give you items of the trip another time—am weary and not in the
                                    very best humor in the world.
                        I hope to obtain fifteen days soon, and perhaps will "ax" you
                                    "how you is?"14

                                    Dear Greene:
                                
                        Your correspondent's short and merry fifteen days' and nights leave
                                    of absence have passed and gone—a croaker might add never to return; not
                                    so, though; fond memory will not loose sight of 'em—oft will
                                    they be lived over again; yet one of 'em, I would rub off the tablet if I
                                    could—the one I spent in Pittsburg, 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                    .
                        
                                    I sometimes, in my dreams at least, have thought
                                    That when in Heaven the Devil's {lag was furled;
                                    That when he saw the damage he had wrought
                                    To his own cause in the etherial world;
                                    That when, by that great power with whom he'd fought,
                                    The rebel chief from his high place was hurled;
                                    When from the blue sky o'er us he was dropped,
                                    He fell as far as Pittsburg—and there stopped.
                                
                        Missing a connection compelled me to go into camp into that miserable coal-hole for
                                    twenty-four hours. Other connections were made, and closely, too, all the way
                                    through; but the Lord deliver me from even an extra hours' breathing spell
                                    in the "Iron City" again.
                        Well, nearly two thousand miles of railroad travelling is excessively fatiguing, and
                                    a "skylark" of fifteen days to be well put in and all the tickets
                                    "punched" requires considerable backbone, but the
                                    heartfelt-pleasure of grasping one's friends by the hand and exchanging
                                    greetings known to be genuine—the relief from all responsibility and duty
                                    for the time repays one richly for the hard travel; at least it did Prock, 
                              
                                 14 The furlough was granted as the following items
                                            reveal: " `Prock.'—Lieut. Landon, of the 14th

                                            deportment while here was in pleasing contrast to those who seem to think
                                            that their special duty when on leave or furlough is to stir up strife and

                                            of the war, &c. It was a severe rebuke to those bigots and fanatics
                                            who are continually trying to poison the minds of the soldiers against a

                                            broached the subject to him, that they could better be employed by attending
                                            to their own business—that it was not his province to Quarrel
                                            with men on account of a difference of opinion—that he claimed

                                    enjoying life and health. The city looked natural and though there was a
                                    "smart sprinklin" of blue jackets and bayonets, I am accustomed to
                                    "sich." In my first glance at the 
                                        Wabash
                                    , really thought some small town above had floated down—so
                                    many arks were moored stern on to the warf; but I soon learned that the steamboat
                                    mania was raging, and a desire to sing—"I'm afloat!
                                    I'm afloat!" had seized the romantic youths of the city. Amongst
                                    others, my worthy friend the General had concluded to— 
                                        "Sink or swim!"
                                     A rough spell of weather on the voyage around from 
                                        St. Louis
                                    —a thumping trip of one hundred hours to 
                                        Russellville
                                    , for a couple of grindstones, ten corks of tan-bark, and a back-down,
                                    including a butt at the draw, thoroughly disgusted my chum of the P. O. with 
                                        "Life on the ocean wave,"
                                     and he wisely concluded to cease "crying the lead" and
                                    cry "'Nuff!" When I met him, there was a tear in his eye
                                    and a five-cent Havana 'twixt his teeth. After the warmest of friendly
                                    greetings and two drinks, said he, with a sigh: "Prock, I have parted with
                                    her!" "Was she on her deathbed?" said I, taking out my
                                    linen, for my eyes were growing moist. "I am going to leave this part of my
                                    adopted country soon," said General, taking hold of his goatee familiarly,
                                    as in days gone by. I drew him closer, and hoarsely whispered: "General,
                                    was it the small-pox? or had she 
                                        "Never told her love, but let concealment,"
                                            &c.,
                                     The General smiled ('tis dangerous to smile too
                                    often in "Old Post" I am told). "She is
                                    a steamboat!" said he. "Her name?" said I, frantically
                                    throwing myself outside (as "Orpheus" would say)
                                    of a glass of Toney's best Cogniac. "The Huffschmidt, sternwheel,
                                    flat-bottomed, canal-boat-rigged packet, capable of transporting one thousand pounds
                                    weight of broom-corn seed and four deck passengers," said the General,
                                    "smiling" again and gently stroking his goatee. The English, or
                                    American rather, for that "2-tonic" name is "Hug
                                    Shore," I was informed—purchased on account of her sobriquet, no
                                    doubt. I congratulate the General publicly on his "sell" and sell
                                    out. One of the incentives, I understand, for getting rid of the boat was the
                                    extraordinary appetites of the crew. Previous to starting from 
                                        St. Louis
                                     to 
                                        Vincennes
                                    , (after the purchase), several pieces of bacon sides, two or three
                                    dozen eggs, and some dried apples were bought for the use of the boat. The crew were
                                    liberally supplied with meat, apples, and one egg a piece for
                                    dinner, but, strange to say, were not satisfied, and complained to the General, who
                                    put the case before Dick, the Captain. The latter was naturally incensed.
                                    "D—–n 'em, give 'em two eggs for
                                    supper, and let 'em bust!" cried he. This was done, and, of
                                    course, it "busted" the owners.
                        But 'tis time, friend G., I was giving you some army items.
                        March weather now, rough, too—duty very heavy. Our picket line is as quiet
                                    as the streets of Old Post on a Sunday morning. Blue  birds—harbingers of
                                    spring—-warble in the trees around camp at early dawn, but the noise
                                    created soon after by countless fifes, drums, bugles, and the shouts of the soldiers
                                    soon frighten them off. I have always been an admirer of this bold and fearless
                                    little songster, and welcome him most cordially.
                        Adjutant Bailey and Capt. Beem, Co. "H," are absent on recruiting
                                    service. Lieut. Andrews, Co. "B," is off on the merry fifteen;
                                    also Capt. Nicholas, Co. "C," from Loogootee. Lieut. Stannis, Co.
                                    "B," has been indisposed since his return, but I am glad to learn
                                    is now convalescent.
                        A few recruits have reached us—perhaps a dozen. Serg't Albert
                                    Wicks, Co. "G," has been detained to drill them. How are you,
                                    recruits? The gallant Sergeant will put the awkward squad through a thorough course
                                    of sprouts; he is untiring and indefatigable, and the would-be soldiers will soon
                                    become acquainted with the tactics.
                        No "Cons" yet. Great pity, too, 'pon my soul! Splendid
                                    weather to set 'em to guessing, and accustom 'em to drill and
                                    dust, to obey and oblique, &c.
                        The health of the "skeleton" regiment is generally
                                    good—no cases of small-pox yet—all the boys have been
                                    vaccinated. In fact, I believe there are no cases reported in our (3d) Division.
                        Private E. Rush Loop is quite ill in Regimental Hospital. He has been detailed as
                                    clerk at regimental head-quarters, and has proved himself A No. 1. The boy has a
                                    very feeble constitution, and though a willing soldier, is really not fit for field
                                    service, and cannot stand the hardships of a soldier's life.
                        First Lieut. John S. Sullivan, Co. H, has been appointed A. A. General to Gen.
                                    Alexander Hays, commanding 3d Division—he having been for some months
                                    past on the General's staff as Aid-de-Camp. "Yankee" is a
                                    favorite throughout the entire Division.
                        First Lieut. James M. Mitchell, Co. I, is now Aid-de-Camp on the staff of Col. S. S.
                                    Carroll, commanding 1st Brigade—the right man in the right place.
                        Col. John Coons brought back a captain's commission for First Lieut. John F.
                                    Douglass, Co. K. "Dug," has long been deserving the promotion.
                        First Lieut. A. M. 
                                        Van
                                     Dyke, Co. G., is with Gen. Harrow at or near 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    . The best wishes of his old comrade, the "Eagle,"
                                    accompany him wherever he goes.
                        My colored servant, Peter Sa-mith, has proved himself the Light-foot of this Brigade
                                    'mongst the "gemmen ob color." There has been great sport
                                    for a week past, and no little excitement over the darkie foot races. A considerable
                                    number of greenbacks, postage currency, and cheap watches have changed hands.
                        The 4th 
                                        Ohio
                                     regiment have a lyceum and a ball-room for "stagg"
                                    dances. The 14th also have a pole-pen, inside of which the admirers of Terpiscore,
                                    nightly assemble to kick up a dust to cat-gut and rosin music, till
                                    "tapps" warn all that silence must
                                    "reign supreme."
                        To a man (especially a soldier) who wishes to "take time by the
                                    forelock," kick care to the wall, and swim in pleasure for a couple of  weeks, I can only say—my friend, hie
                                    thee to 
                                        Baltimore
                                     and be "gay and happy," for verilly and of a truth
                                    the Monumental City, in my humble opinion, is filled to overflowing with
                                    strawberries and cream, with or without sugar, and the words "No
                                    Admittance" are not visible. Open doors is the order of the day and night. Seek and ye shall find; and there is no lack of
                                    "signs"—he that runs may read. Hurrah for 
                                        Baltimore
                                    ! I had two 4th of Julys there, and other things by gross, dozen, half
                                    dozen, raw, stewed, smothered, with sauce and without, and hugely did the boy enjoy
                                    all these blessings, by night and by day—running, standing, flying, and
                                    otherwise.
                        Who could not enjoy life under such rose-colored circumstances? Alas! the time for my
                                    departure arrived entirely too d—–d soon; and here I am at the
                                    "Mystic Front," and a canteen of "Commissary"
                                    the only comforter. Tan-bark, juice, tar-water, turpentine, brown sugar, lamp-oil
                                    and alcohol are the ingredients. After a hearty swig, a fellow feels as though some
                                    one was inside, striking two flints together—the fire flying out of his
                                    eyes. Price, 50 cents, in rag currency, per quart.
                        I know men who have imbibed so much that hair has actually grown on their teeth. I am
                                    using it for the express purpose of testing its qualities as a restorative, but have
                                    little confidence in its virtues. At present there are no signs of
                                    "har" visible, and several quarts have been disposed of.
                        Ye Paymaster, with a huge pile of greenbacks, made all of us rejoice tother day by
                                    replenishing our pocket-books.
                        "Vet. Vol." private Asher W. Foster, Co. "G," has
                                    returned from his thirty-five days' furlough.
                        I have heard a rumor that your office has been demolished by the soldiers. Hope
                                    'tis untrue; am sure none of the 1st Brigade could be induced by cowardly,
                                    street loafers (who blow about their loyalty and love for this Union and the old
                                    flag, yet dare not fight to maintain either) to commit such an act of ruffianism.
                        I should like to take another duck hunt; will, too—man never goes under
                                    till his time conies. General says that is "every other time."
                                    Can't see it!

                                    Friend Greene:
                                
                        I will write you a full account of the campaign from the 3rd to the 10th of May as
                                    soon as I am at all comfortably situated.
                        The 14th was in the fight of May 5th and 6th at Brock's Cross-Roads, and in
                                    the fight on the north bank of the river Po, on the farm of Giles C. Graves, on the
                                    evening of the 10th inst.
                        I was wounded severely in the left ankle and sent from the "field
                                    hospital" to the city yesterday. Since then I have not heard any reliable
                                    news from the regiment, though five thousand "Johnnies" captured
                                    by the 2d corps passed by this hospital this forenoon.

                                        wounded in the ankle on May 10. See the list of wounded and dead below, and also

                        I expect to be sent to

                                    Friend Greene:
                                
                        Having reached the "City of Magnificent Distances" and taken up
                                    quarters where things are, to say the least, most comfortable, I proceed according
                                    to promise to give you a sketch of the campaign in the
                                    "Wilderness."
                        Our regiment, the 14th Indiana, crossed the Rapidan for the fifth time about 8
                                    o'clock on the morning of the 4th of May, having broken up camp at 11
                                    o'clock the night previous. The sun shone bright and warm, and the veterans
                                    of a score of battles soon began to lighten their loads; and from this date till I
                                    left the front (11th inst.), the roads were strewn thickly with U. S. blankets,
                                    shelter tents, over-coats, and clothing of every description. I never saw anything
                                    to equal it—the old soldiers of the army carry nothing now but arms,
                                    ammunition, and the grub-bag (haversack).
                        We bivouacked the night of the 4th on the old battle-field, one mile south of
                                    Chancellorsville. The woods were strewn with the skeletons of comrades killed here
                                    one year ago.18
                        
                        The boys of company "I" found the remains of Sergeant Tom Kidd,
                                    lying where the brave fellow fell on the 2d19 of May,
                                    '63; the strips were still visible on the sleeves of his
                                    blouse—all that was left was at last decently interred.
                        At sun-rise on the 5th we pushed farther south. Soon after passing 
                              
                                 17

                                 19 May 3 is probably meant, though Sergeant Kidd may
                                            have been killed during the night of May 2, 1863. See letter of May 6, 1863,

                                     Cobb's tavern, the cavalry in our front
                                    commenced a brisk skirmish with the enemy, both sides using artillery. This fire
                                    opened at precisely 12 o'clock, and the noise of either cannon or musketry
                                    had never entirely ceased either day or night when I left the army for 
                                        Fredericksburg
                                     hospital—an interval of seven days!
                        Countermarching, we again passed the hotel mentioned above, and moved off at
                                    double-quick in a due westerly course—heavy cavalry fighting all along
                                    our flank; and the scary riders (all were not by any means) having had enough for
                                    the day, were constantly seen riding furiously to the rear, and nearly all capless.
                        At 4 o'clock a tremendous musketry fire opened, with occasional discharges
                                    of artillery directly in our front. In a few moments, out of breath and heated to a
                                    perfect glow, we reached Brock's Roads, and piling knapsacks, dashed into
                                    the fight, the left of our regiment saving two pieces of artillery directly on the
                                    plank-road, that were under a terrible fire from the enemy's
                                    sharp-shooters, they having killed all the horses and disabled the cannoniers. After
                                    blazing away until dark, we were relieved by a strong, double line of skirmishers,
                                    and without withdrawing from our positions, slept on our arms.
                        Ammunition was distributed at 3 A.M., and soon after the musket fight again opened
                                    with redoubled fury. This was kept up with varying success till 2 P.M., neither
                                    party seeming to gain much advantage. The thick undergrowth of black-jacks was
                                    literally mowed down with balls, and the ground so often charged over taken and
                                    re-taken, covered with dead and dying men and horses. The woods taking fire,
                                    compelled both sides to cease firing. Our men fell back to the road running east and
                                    west, and threw up a long line of entrenchments. At 4 o'clock our brigade
                                    took a position some 400 yards in rear of this, stacked arms, and the men were
                                    cooking the first meal for over twenty-four hours, when again the heavy vollies
                                    began to roll off in front. Longstreet's whole corps were making a grand
                                    charge on our centre—the advance line had driven part of the 1st division
                                    out of the hastily constructed breastworks, immediately in our front, when the four
                                    old vneteran regiments of Carroll's brigade (the 4th and 8th 
                                        Ohio
                                    , 7th 
                                        Virginia
                                     Vet. Vols., and 14th Indiana) sprang to their arms, and with a cheer
                                    that made the old woods ring, drove the bold soldiers of Longstreet over the
                                    structure again and broke their line. Many dead rebels were left lying across the
                                    breast-works—amongst them a major, and two captains. Two stands of colors
                                    were captured. This, with the exception of the never-ceasing skirmishing,
                                    picket-firing, and sharp-shooting, ended the conflict at this point.
                        On the 7th we lay quiet all day—the skirmishing was so heavy in front that
                                    many times during the day the men would, without command, gather around the
                                    gun-stacks; but Longstreet had enough for the present, and was off.
                        The 8th and 9th were spent by us in throwing up intrenchments, &c. Having
                                    moved many miles to the left, we came in sight of the Po river at 5 P.M. Here Lieut.
                                    Gen. Grant and Gen. Meade passed through the files of our regiment as it lay in an
                                    open field in line of battle. After a sharp skirmish, we crossed the Po at
                                    6$1/2 o'clock, and bivouacked on the farm of one Giles C.
                                    Graves. Chickens, turkies, pigs,  and the
                                    contents of a smoke-house, ice-house, and corn-crib soon disappeared, although the
                                    rebel sharp-shooters made the vicinity of these out-houses a dangerous place till
                                    dark. Men, though, after a few days' constant fighting, care but little for
                                    life, and really don't mind the fire of sharp-shooters or skirmishers but
                                    little more than people at home do house flies.
                        On the morning of the 10th our batteries opened all around. We lay for some hours
                                    watching the shells burst—no reply from the "Johnny"
                                    guns for some time; finally, however, they opened out, and the chimnies and board
                                    fences around Graves' dwelling flew to pieces in grand style. Soon after
                                    our brigade was put in motion, re-crossed the Po, and moved off to the left to
                                    support a charge of the 5th corps. We formed for the charge in five lines. Remember
                                    there are ten "skeleton" regiments in our
                                    brigade now. Whilst closed thus in mass, awaiting the bugle call to advance, the
                                    "Johnnies" made the solid shot and shrapnel whistle around
                                    us—pieces of railroad iron were also thrown, making a—well, a
                                    hell of a noise expresses it fully. One of these "chunks" of
                                    "pig" cut down a tall pine near by, two feet in diameter.
                        At half-past two the bugle sounded the advance. We were in the second line of the
                                    brigade line of battle. Soon after entering a thicket our line halted, and the front
                                    line halted and the front line of battle engaged the enemy fifty yards in front of
                                    us. One of the "Johnny" messengers having brought the
                                    "claret" [blood] from your correspondent, he passed through the
                                    line and reported to the Colonel. "Take my horse, Will [urged a friend,]
                                    and ride him out—I cannot get along with him in this
                                    underbrush." These were the last words I ever heard the "bravest
                                    of the brave" speak. I mourn his loss, for he was my friend, and a lion in
                                    the day and hour of battle. Peace to his soul!
                        The night following was spent amongst the groans and cries of the wounded and dying
                                    at the Corps' field-hospital. I had much rather have been on a skirmish or
                                    picket-line than amongst the army butchers.
                        At 4 P.M. on the 11th, the ambulance train started for 
                                        Fredericksburg
                                    . The rain poured down in torrents, and we reached our destination,
                                    after being jolted for sixteen hours in coming fourteen miles' Several times the train was stopped to bury some
                                    poor fellow. That road will be lined with graves. The city itself was simply a
                                    dilapidated, dirty hole. I was glad to leave there at 10 o'clock A. M., on
                                    the 15 inst.
                        Once more north of the Rappahannock! 'Tis the tenth time I
                                    have crossed the infernal stream.
                        The road to Belle Plain Landing on the Potomac was simply horrible. Before reaching
                                    the Potomac we passed a large hollow, very deep and round like a bowl. In this were
                                    confined 10,000 "Johnnies"—they are the hardest
                                    two-legged things to see in America, by thunder—being: just the color of
                                    the ground or one of their d—–d "Johnny
                                    cakes" of corn meal. Two batteries of bright, brass twelve-pounders, one on
                                    each side of the hole, frowned down on 'em, whilst guards paced the entire
                                    circuit at intervals of about fifteen yards with muskets leaded, capped, and
                                    half-cocked. Reserves were also posted at convenient  distances—the men lounging around their
                                    gun-stacks ready to "fall in" at the first alarm.
                        Lieut. Col. E. H. C. Cavins, 14th Indiana, has command of about 800 recruits and
                                    returning veterans (for different regiments in the Army of the Potomac) at this
                                    place. He is retained here with his "mixed" command to assist
                                    should there be any trouble with the rebel prisoners.
                        The Sanitary men and women and those of the U. S. Christian Commission are working
                                    night and day to aleviate the sufferings of the wounded soldiers both at 
                                        Fredericksburg
                                     and Belle Plain. There is no estimating how much relief their presence
                                    affords our brave bluejackets I saw Mr. Kellogg (formerly of the firm of Kellogg
                                    & Smith) amongst them. He was very kind to me. But I have made this letter
                                    very tedious I fear, and will close.
                        Sailed up the Potomac, for the fourth time, on the steamer 
                                        Connecticut
                                    —had a huge "nip" of "milk
                                    punch" strong, and a most refreshing sleep aboard. Am
                                    getting along finely, if I can only keep quiet. 'Tis hard work, too!
                        
                                    PROCK.
                                
                        P.S.—I have just learned of the death of Sergeant Albert Wicks, of
                                    Co. "G." I thought everything of that boy, and am deeply pained to
                                    know that I shall meet my gallant comrade, tried and true friend, no more. The
                                    Second Corps has covered itself with glory, but we have to mourn the loss of scores
                                    of brave men. Any thing directed to me here will be promptly forwarded, should
                                    I be sent (as I expect I shall) to some other hospital.

                                    May 21, 1864.20
                           
                                
                        
                                    Friend Greene:
                                
                        Having nothing to do but to keep quiet, grin, and bear it, I will jot down for you a
                                    few more items and incidents of the late battles in the Wilderness.
                        The late battle-field of Chancellorsville was still strewn thickly with fragments of
                                    the strife—portions of cannon, their limbers and caissons broken;
                                    muskets, pieces of uniform, haversacks, canteens, knapsacks, and the bleaching
                                    skeletons of the brave fellows that fought and fell; rifle-pits, and breast-works, a
                                    portion partially demolished, were visible in all directions. Both armies adopted
                                    the McClellan plan—"fortify as you go"—a few
                                    shovels full of earth and a log or two save many lives.
                        Strange feelings crept over me as we marched along the same road and over the same
                                    ground where one year and a day before I had stood up with my comrades in line of
                                    battle. The old white house occupied as headquarters by Gen. Couch during the fight,
                                    shattered and torn with hostile shot and shell, is still standing, a refuge for bats
                                    and owls (ghosts, too, for aught I know).
                        I remember the identical tree on which hung our blood-red hospital flag. A group of
                                    tall, stately pines, near which a lot of beeves were butchered for us first, and a
                                    lot of rebels by us afterward (in the 
                              
                                 20
                                            
                                                Vincennes
                                            
                                            Western Sun, May 28, 1864. The letters of May 18 and May
                                            21 were both published in the Sun of May 28.
                           
                                     charge made by the 1st brigade, 3d division, 2d
                                    corps), are left standing—their trunks splintered, bruised and torn by
                                    rifle balls and cannon shot, bear witness to the fierceness of the contest.
                        Beyond the battle-field some five miles, in a southerly direction, we crossed the Ny
                                    river, a mere ditch, not over twelve or fifteen feet in width. On the southern bank
                                    was a smelting furnace (since burned by our troops), and beyond an iron-ore mine,
                                    worked quite recently, as the heaps of freshly-dug ore indicated.
                        At Cobb's Tavern, we saw the first secesh females—quite a squad
                                    of 'em there was, too. Their look was one of bitterness and hatred. Little
                                    care the rough soldiery for this, however—three years service steels a
                                    man's heart to anything.
                        The ground in front of the position so hotly contested for on the 5th and 6th of May
                                    [1864] presented all the horrors of a battlefield, including the
                                    charred and blackened remains of those who were burned and smothered in the blazing
                                    leaves and underbrush; saplings were split into matches by the storm of bullets.
                                    Soldiers of all ranks lay there—a muddy slough filled with spice bushes
                                    was literally corduroyed with the dead bodies of our fellows, whilst on the narrow
                                    ridge directly in front the Johnnies lay piled in heaps. Sharp-shooters commanded
                                    the plank-road, and if a man wanted to be satisfied for once that he was the
                                    identical individual fired at, his curiosity could at once be gratified by leisurely
                                    crossing this highway of Death. Towards the close of the fight Col. Coons gave he
                                    his horse to carry a dispatch to Gen. Webb, and in doing so, I was compelled to
                                    gallop some distance down the plank-road. No use dodging—they flew too
                                    thick! Why I was not killed, can't tell—time hadn't
                                    come I guess. 'Tis astonishing how soon men become accustomed and totally
                                    indifferent to danger. During these successive fights in the Wilderness I have
                                    frequently seen soldiers sitting by the side of a dead comrade eating, whilst others
                                    were loading and firing with all their might in the same line.
                        An ice-house was captured on the 7th by our skirmishers from the Johnny pickets, and
                                    was the "bone of contention" all day, our men holding it, however.
                                    'Twas amusing and exciting to see our fellows (those not engaged) crawling
                                    down to the skirmish line after their "rations of ice," and coming
                                    back on a "double-quick" when the ration had been served. All of
                                    these adventurers did not escape unscathed.
                        A regiment of Chippewa Indians were sent out on the 9th to sharp-shoot. The yell they
                                    raised on getting in range of the Johnnies scared nobody, but on the contrary was so
                                    original that men on both sides laughed heartily. These "allies"
                                    were, I presume, denied the privilege of scalping a fallen foe, as I saw none of
                                    those "reeking trophies" in their belts on their return.
                        I noticed that the Heights of 
                                        Fredericksburg
                                     were not fortified in the rear. The train of ambulances coming in well
                                    up the river and winding down in front of all the rifle-pits and earth-works, I had
                                    the gratification of thoroughly inspecting this rebel stronghold—this
                                    time at "short range," and without being shot at! I always said
                                    (and shall  stick to it), that this position was
                                    and is impregnable, when held by veterans, to an attack in front.
                        The fields in the immediate vicinity of the town were planted with corn principally,
                                    which was just sprouting—soon to be trampled into mire by the thousands
                                    of horses and mules attached to this army.
                        Had the Johnny bullet-hole been in my arm instead of my foot, I should have tried to
                                    visit some places of interest (to me) in this town—the house Co.
                                    "G" was quartered in both before and after the fight in Dec.
                                    '62—the depot where the huge 20-pound shells first bursted in
                                    our ranks, and the ditch into which our poor fellows, killed in this
                                    "Burnside's slaughter-pen," were thrown.
                        The country north of 
                                        Fredericksburg
                                    , all the way to the Potomac, is a barren waste—now and then
                                    a house filled with women and children, who wear a care-worn frightened look that
                                    arouses one's sympathies at once. How they have subsisted the past winter,
                                    God only knows! I saw perhaps half a dozen little patches (for roasting ears,
                                    probably) a few peas, beans, onions, &c.—no fences, though, not a
                                    sign of an enclosure was there. A hard, hard lot is theirs! These are probably the
                                    families of the devilish guerrillas that scour this desolate waste as Arabs do the
                                    Desert, but nevertheless the helpless women and children are to be pitied.
                        I never saw our men so determined—so confident as they were and are during
                                    this campaign. All seemed to be firmly convinced from the time we crossed the
                                    Rapidan that this was to be the final struggle between the Army of the Potomac and
                                    the Army of Northern Va.; that Lieut. Gen. U. S. Grant was too much for Lee, and
                                    therefore one and all were confident of success; that they will be successful I have
                                    not the least doubt. May Heaven grant it!
                        I will jot down a few items of hospital life in my next.
                        Tell the General I am in receipt of his last letter—but presume these is

                                    "Dear —– Persimmon," nor could I clearly
                                    understand the lock of auburn `har'—unless it was a slight
                                    insinuation that the article was `scace' with me. Ye

                                    careful when they write to soldiers in U. S. General Hospital, and leave out the company and regiment—unless they do this, the
                                    letters will certainly go to the regiment, wherever it is, first.
                                    Write name of hospital and ward plainly. As for instance, "Lieut.

                                    far I am improving—should the inflamation not increase, will be marching
                                    around in "four ranks" (two of 'em wooden files) B 4

            "A private letter was received by a friend yesterday from Lieut. Landon, from which we are
                    permitted to take the following extracts. "Frock's" numerous friends will
                    be gratified to learn that his wound is progressing favorably:"21
            
            
                    
                  
                     
                        I am out of doors today, on a camp (iron) bed-stead. It is bully to suck in the fresh
                                    air by the mouthfuls once more, and get away from the d—–d
                                    hospital stinks in the close ward, and escape from the cussed flies, flees and
                                    bed-bugs. Ah! I feel 50 per cent better—that I do; and my foot is
                                    assuming a somewhat natural shape, though the bullet has not yet been extracted, and
                                    the probability is that it may heal up with the rebel lead inside.
                        I have not heard a word from the Old Post for two weeks—no letters or
                                        papers.22
                        
                        I am froze to hear from the old regiment. Have any of the boys got home? I can well
                                    imagine what a bully, good time they will have in a few days.
                        Write! write! and enjoin all my friends to do the same.
                        I guess I shall have to put in a tall old visit to Old

                                    bullets do take at times—one man shot in the right eye, bullet went clean
                                    around his head under the left ear, and came out through his left eye!

                                    Dear Greene:
                                
                        All of the "vets of the war" and "recruits" who
                                    have a year or more to serve Uncle Samuel, that formerly belonged to the 14th
                                    Indiana, and are now attached to the 20th Indiana, are to be divided into two
                                    companies on the reorganization of that regiment, so as to give the non-commissioned
                                    officers of the 14th, who reenlisted last winter, a chance. This is a simple act of
                                    justice to brave men. Well, the boys know that justice and a fair show for all
                                    honors to those deserving them will be meeted out by Col. Taylor of the 20th. My
                                    informant says "our fellows are highly pleased with their new Colonel, and
                                    are quite at home with the men of the gallant double X Indiana regiment." I
                                    am glad of it. There are many clever souls and brave and daring soldiers in that
                                    "remnant" of the 14th, and I shall always take an interest in the
                                    welfare of my old comrades.

                        I failed in my letter, a few days ago, to return thanks through the columns of your
                                    most excellent paper to a few warm-hearted, kind, and true friends both of the Old

                                    with all the comforts and attentions they and theirs could bestow on a wounded
                                    friend. These good people know not how deeply their generous offers stirred the
                                    soldier's heart. Whilst there is a pulsation there, 'twill be for
                                    them. 'Tis cheering to know that one has friends. Nothing
                                    lightens the load through life so much as their warm welcomes, their earnest
                                    greetings (sympathy, too, when needed), and cheerful countenances. God bless

                        There are three classes of visitors to the hospitals. First, and least important, are
                                    the wordy sympathizers—of both sexes—the
                                    male portion of these "drones" are generally composed of
                                    broken-down, short-winded, long-faced, seedy preachers of all denominations. They
                                    walk solemnly up and down the wards, between the couches of patient sufferers; first
                                    casting their cadaverous looks and ghostly shadow upon all, and then, after a whispered consultation with the surgeon of the ward, offer to
                                    pray; do so, and retire, without having smiled on a single soldier
                                    or dropped a word of comfort or cheer. The females belonging to this (the
                                    "first class") go gawking through the wards, peeping into every
                                    curtained couch, seldom exchanging a word with the occupant, but (as they invariably
                                    "hunt in couples") giving vent to their pent up
                                    "pheelinks" in heart-rending (?) outbursts
                                    of—"Oh, my Savior!" "Phoebe, do look
                                    here!" "Only see what a horrid wound!"
                                    "Goodness, gracious, how terrible war is!" "My! my!!
                                    my!!! Oh, let's go—I can't stand it any
                                    longer!" And as they near the door, perhaps these dear creatures will wind
                                    up with an audible—"Heavens! what a smell! Worse than fried
                                    onions!"

                                    in its proper place, kids, canes, and patent leathers, seal rings, and an odor of
                                    musk. Accompanying these are wasp-waisted, almond-eyed, cherry-lipped,
                                    finely-powdered damsels, carrying tiny baskets, containing an exquisitely
                                    embroidered handkerchief, highly perfumed, and a vial or two of restoratives (to be
                                    used in case of sudden indisposition). This batch of "sight
                                    seers," do-nothings, idlers, time-killers, fops, and butterflies skip
                                    through the hospital, and like summer shadows, leave no trace behind.
                        But the members of the third class (and thank fortune, their name is legion) with
                                    their cheerful and benevolent countenances, words of sympathy and encouragement;
                                    their ever ready smile and helping hand to fan the fevered brow or carry a cup of
                                    cooling beverage to parched lips; their quiet step, plain and unassuming manners;
                                    their earnest enquiries and endeavors to find out whether the soldier may not need
                                    something—anything that money can purchase or kindness bestow; their
                                    thousand and one most welcome gifts, from a fresh and fragrant rose to
                                    a—well, I hardly know what not; for the catalogue of presents from these
                                    good Samaritans is as endless as their generosity  is unbounded. Their whole souls are in the good work, and many an eye glistens
                                    with a bright tear-bead to hear their kind words, and in returning thanks for these
                                    (to the soldier) priceless treasures. These noble souls totally obliterate all signs
                                    or thoughts of the two former classes of visitors—the "sight
                                    seers" and "ah, me's!"
                        Now, all soldiers are not alike any more than other people, to-be-sure, and while one
                                    will eagerly accept a gift from strange hands, another by his side would quietly but
                                    most respectfully refuse, with the remark—"bestow your gifts, my
                                    kind sir, on some one more in need of luxuries or necessaries;" but each
                                    and every gallant fellow feels his heart beat with joy as these articles are
                                    distributed, and the donors do not experience more real pleasure in bestowing than
                                    the blue jackets in receiving, and the hearty "God bless you" of
                                    many a mangled and suffering volunteer no doubt re-pays them ten thousand times
                                    o'er.
                        The odor from the "dead-house" when it is first opened for
                                    ventilation each day, is most offensive. This institution is entirely too near the
                                    hospital. The military command, a first Lieutenant of the Second Battallion, Invalid
                                    Corps, is a thorough going soldier (minus his right arm), keeps the yard and grounds
                                    thoroughly policed and his men as clean and neat as soap, blacking and pipe clay can
                                    make a soldier, his clothing, and arms. In fact, the boys spend two-thirds of their
                                    time, when off duty, polishing up.
                        The foot continues to improve. Hail

                                    that, like Davy Crockett, "I was so tarnation angry when the ball hit me
                                    that the hostile lead melted and ran out."

                                    us Hoosier boys frequently. Prock is largely indebted to him for Indiana papers and
                                    other most acceptable reading matter, including Major-General George B.
                                    McClellan's Report.
                        I must not forget to mention the names of a number of Indiana ladies who have been
                                    very, very kind to us. Indeed, Mrs. Senator Lane, Mrs. John P. Usher, Mrs. Judge

                                    contributed a large share to our comfort during the long weary hours of confinement
                                    to a couch of painful suffering. The soldiers' blessings go with them and
                                    all who go around doing good in this abode of trials and sufferings, of wounds and

                                            was the wife of John P. Usher of

                                    and quietly to the "other shore," there taking his place
                                    "in line" with comrades gone before, will "march and
                                    counter-march" through Hades until the shrill blast of Gabriel's
                                    golden bugle, sounding the "assembly," warns the spirits of
                                    departed soldiers to prepare for a last "Grand Review," then
                                    "falling in," he takes the "step" from his
                                    "file leader," and pausing only to salute the Great Captain as he
                                    files past, enters with brave heart and a firm, confident tread upon the campaign
                                    that is to last forever.
                        I received a letter from Capt. Patterson last evening stating that the old 14th was
                                    no more. The war-worn remnant of the gallant old regiment had gone to their homes,
                                    never perhaps to again rally under the old blue ribbons that once
                                    composed a handsome battle-flag. Joy go with them, and may many long years of
                                    unalloyed happiness fall to their lot. None are more deserving, surely.
                        I heard a rumor that my much esteemed friend, ye General, was in Porkopolis [

                                    ] lately on a "sparring tour," and had purchased the
                                    "Blue Goose." All things must have been lovely.

                        Prock can't see it—still should it prove a "true

                                    have passed as a soldier, and "sich" gay 4ths
                                    they have been, too! Ha! ha! Well remembered, I fancy, by many a 14th man who may
                                    chance to read this.
                        I may not "take up my line of march" from here for ten days yet,
                                    and then 'twill not be towards Hoosierdom. So all letters and papers

               Prehistoric Antiquities of Indiana. By Eli Lilly. Indiana Historical Society, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , 1937. Pp. xiii, 293, illustrated, $5.00.
            One is seldom privileged to review a publication which combines so many outstanding innovations. This
                        de luxe volume will serve as a lasting memento to the author; bring
                    superlative commendations to the Indiana Historical Society; and establish a unique standard for
                    archeological publications. It will give to the present generation in the Hoosier State a review of
                    past archeological records, and enable everyone to grasp the full significance of the prehistoric
                    heritage in the state.
            The author has very modestly set forth in the Preface the real purpose of this book: "The
                    object in writing … was to interest more of the people of Indiana in the relics of our
                    vanished predecessors, and to stimulate inquiry into the prehistory and archaeology of our state.
                    The pursuit of this subject has led the author along such pleasant paths that he is desirous of
                    sharing them with others." The reviewer was privileged to participate in the fascinating
                    work of recovering a very small part of the prehistory of Indiana. He feels it a duty, therefore, to
                    point out that the science of anthropology, especially archeology, has grown by leaps and bounds not
                    only in Indiana, but in the entire northern Mississippi Valley because of Mr.
                    Lilly's enthusiastic response to the problems confronting scientists in this region.
            Indiana has now passed the initial step of outlining the important prehistoric problems within the
                    state and we can look forward to the fruitful phase which will follow under the expert guidance of
                    the archaeological staff. Much is yet to be accomplished, but with the highest hurdle cleared and
                    inches to spare, the remaining problems will be taken in a natural stride.
            There are two methods now being followed by the professional archaeogolist in obtaining a true
                    picture of the prehistory of a state. One method is to sample as many of the outstanding sites as
                    possible in order to obtain an outline or "bird's-eye view" of the
                    prehistoric picture. Another method is to survey systematically the state by county units or stream
                    valleys, making sufficient excavations to obtain a cross section  within these units of the aboriginal material cultures. The latter requires planned research,
                    often unlimited patience on the part of the investigator and sponsor, but in the end will give the
                    most accurate history of the first inhabitants. It is a pleasure to report that Indiana has
                    willingly responded to the latter approach. Prehistoric Antiquities of Indiana
                    presents in a form unsurpassed a compilation based on the work of various investigators whose
                    programs of research have been based on systematically surveying the more important river valleys,
                    using the county as a unit. This may serve as a model for other state organizations, especially when
                    the dry initial reports are so entertainingly summarized.
            Members of the Indiana Historical Society will cherish the volume even though they have no interest
                    in the recreation of prehistory. This quarto volume is beautifully printed by The Lakeside Press on
                    Ivory Wove Linweave text paper with 14 pt. Baskerville type. It contains eighty-eight pages of
                    illustrations produced by the Donnelley Deeptone process, a recent development of deep-etched
                    lithography. The end papers carry a panoramic view of The Great Circle at Mounds Park, now well
                    protected as a state park near Anderson, Indiana. The illustrations have been faithfully reproduced
                    from prints made by an expert photographer. The artistic arrangement of the specimens is quite
                    unusual, especially for archeological reports. The mounting on such backgrounds as white sand, bear
                    robes, tree sections, old survey maps of archeological sites are quite effective. But the
                    arrangement of discoidals on an illustration of a carved shell gorget depicting the use of
                    discoidals and carved stone tobacco pipes mounted on a pressed specimen of Nicotiana
                        attenuata produces very pleasant, attractive, and novel illustrations when compared to the
                    more usual black and white reproductions. The chapter initials very appropriately show design
                    elements from carved bones recovered in some of the 
                        Ohio
                        Hopewell
                     mounds. All of this is handsomely bound between green and brown buckram cloth boards,
                    with gold-stamped front cover and backbone. One must see the book to appreciate it fully.
            The story told by Prehistoric Antiquities of Indiana is just as entertainingly
                    written as the format suggests. It combines modern viewpoints derived from the sound theories  upon which they are based. Any difference of opinion that might
                    exist between the author and other specialists in the field is of such a nature that even the
                    professionals are divided as to the correct solution. Mr. Lilly touches upon controversial subjects
                    and sublimates the theories of all in noteworthy style. The abundant use of footnotes not only
                    clarifies details, but credits everyone who has contributed anything to the archaeology of the
                    state.
            The first three chapters have the following headings:
            "The Original Antiquity of the American Indian"
            "A Tentative Outline of the Prehistory of Indiana"
            (To the reviewer this is the most important chapter and should be read not only by the archeologist,
                    but by everyone interested in the history of this state. The outline is one of the most clear cut
                    and up-to-date presentations of these problems.)
            "Some striking Prehistoric Sites in Indiana"
            (Herein is reviewed all previous research. It can serve as an excellent guide for the expansion of
                    state parks and recreation areas which would preserve these remnants of a prehistoric civilization.)
            The remaining seven chapters deal primarily with descriptions, classifications and illustrations of
                    the various types of artifacts from the entire state.
            Another important contribution and a subject which first brought Mr. Lilly to the attention of
                    archeologists is an archaeological biblography of Indiana, which he began many years ago and
                    published in May, 1932. The bibliography included in this volume is revised and considerably
                    enlarged. All publications, after the more general ones, have been alphabetically arranged according
                    to author and the counties within the state.
            In closing, the reviewer wishes to offer his sincere congratulations to Mr. Lilly for establishing
                    this high standard for archaeological publications and to express complete satisfaction in the
                    methods used by him to place the study of Indiana archaeology before the public and scholars in such
                    a handsome form.

               The Hidden Lincoln, from the Letters and Papers of William H. Herndon. Edited by
                    Emanuel Hertz. The Viking Press, 
                        New York
                    , 1938. Pp. 461, illustrated, $5.00.
            Mr. Hertz is an able and honest student of Lincoln and Herndon. He has prepared a very valuable
                    volume, not the least important part of which is his "Introduction" of twenty-four
                    pages. This, in itself, is a real contribution to Lincoln historiography. Of the letters and other
                    documents compiled and published in this collection, the editor says: 
                        Here at last is Herndon's complete evidence, the full record of the steps by which
                            he reached his conclusions, the supporting testimony of his and Lincoln's
                            contemporaries. The principals of the story are no longer alive, and no excuse remains for
                            silence. These seventy years have made meaningless the passions which were responsible for
                            the misunderstanding of Herndon and his motives. Now we who love the memory of Lincoln may
                            probably thank the fate which gave us William Herndon's unflagging passion for
                            completeness. …
                    
            
            There are two hundred thirty-nine pages of "Letters from Herndon", that bear dates
                    from January 8, 1866, to February 27, 1891. Under "Evidences" the compiler
                    presents seventy-four pages of "Letters to Herndon", fifty pages of
                    "Statements Collected by Herndon", and fifty pages of "Herndon's
                    Notes and Monographs". Quite a number of the students of Lincoln have gone through some of
                    the original copies of these documents and a few have had access to many of them, but their
                    publication opens them to all.
            A reading of Herndon's papers convinces one that he knew many things about Lincoln from
                    close association and that he gathered much additional information from others that might otherwise
                    have been lost. No careful biographer of Lincoln has neglected Herndon in the past, and certainly
                    none will fail to use the Herndon material in the future. Researchers gleaning information from the
                    letters and other writings of Herndon will accept facts which he had a chance to know or facts
                    gathered from others who were in a position to know them. They will, of course, accept some
                    statements that purport to be true with caution, weighing the reliability of the evidence as they
                    would from any other source.
            It is very apparent that Herndon persistently theorized about what he knew and what, he learned
                    concerning Lincoln. Some of his theories he repeated over and over. He had a large amount of
                    personal experience and information as a basis for his theories and conclusions, but they
                    nevertheless  remain the theories and conclusions of a man who
                    was far from infallible. The only safe way for one who searches through the Herndon material is to
                    distinguish carefully between fact and opinion since these are well mixed together in almost every
                    paragraph. After sifting out the facts and interpreting them for himself, the researcher can
                    undoubtedly profit by checking his own conclusions with those of Herndon.
            Mr. Hertz evidently believes that the publication of the Herndon papers will rehabilitate
                    Lincoln's law partner. Whether this result shall follow or not, a reading of the material
                    will reveal to anyone both the strength and the limitations of Herndon. Mr. Hertz is correct in his
                    belief that the sources which he has compiled will do no "harm to Lincoln's name
                    and fame." It is true that the papers "contain the best yet said as well as the
                    worst of the man Lincoln", and perhaps most students of Lincoln will agree with the belief
                    of Hertz that "an unbiased and accurate Life of Lincoln is now much more nearly
                    possible" than before the appearance of The Hidden Lincoln.

               The First Hundred Years of 
                            Lake County
                        , by Sam B. Woods was recently published privately. It is mainly a compilation
                    of short newspaper articles on current affairs and problems published through the years from 1885 to
                    1937. The earlier articles, or layman's editorials, were written by Bartlett Woods and the
                    later ones by his son Sam B. Woods. The book also contains a short historical sketch of early 
                        Lake County
                     and a small amount of Civil War correspondence. The volume runs to over four hundred
                    pages and can be purchased of Sam B. Woods of Griffith, Indiana. It will be reviewed in our next
                    issue.
            The Indiana Historical Society has published three numbers of volume one of the new
                    "Prehistory Research Series" recently launched. Number 1, by Paul Weer was issued
                    in July, 1937, under the title Preliminary Notes on the Iroquoian Family. It is a
                    pamphlet of twenty-four pages. Number 2, published in December, 1937, and edited by Caroline Dunn,
                        Jacob Piatt Dunn: His Miami Language Studies and Indian Manuscript Collection,
                    is made up of three parts. The first portion is a sketch of her father's work on the
                    language of  the Miami Indians by Miss Dunn. The second part
                    lists the "Manuscript Indian Material" of Mr. Dunn to be found in the Indiana
                    State Library. The third part, which is in the form of an "Appendix," consists of
                    a bibliography of the published writings of Mr. Dunn. It is not complete, but there is enough to
                    show his varied interests. Number 3 of volume one is a pamphlet of forty-nine pages that came from
                    the press in January, 1938. This study, Shawnee Stems and the Jacob P. Dunn Miami
                        Dictionary, by C. F. Vogelin, is Part I of a longer study of the Miami language. The
                    numbers in this "Prehistory Research Series" are distributed free, as they are
                    published, to all members of the Indiana Historical Society. Others desiring copies should get in

            Readers who are interested in the life of Robert Owen or in 
                        New Harmony
                     will find an informing and interesting article in the Spring issue of The
                        American Scholar for 1938. The article, "Robert Owen: Backwater of
                    History?" by Kenneth M. Gould, presents a thoughtful discussion of Owen's place in
                    history. The American Scholar is a quarterly magazine published under the auspices
                    of Phi Beta Kappa.
            
            In the same issue of The American Scholar there is an article on "Food and
                    Society: War-time activities of the 
                        United States
                     Food Administration" by Almon R. Wright. The author discusses the Food
                    Administration's work and the extensive records in the National Archives. We were fortunate
                    to be able to publish an article based on these records and written by William J. 
                        Van
                     Schreeven, a member of the staff of the National Archives, in our December issue. The
                    article referred to dealt with "Indiana Food Administration Papers."

            I MARK TIME, 1903–1908*
            
            WILLIAM O. LYNCH
            
            A few times, when I was starting on my second year in high school in the fall of 1886, I watched the 
                        Delphi
                     Light Guards as they drilled. They met on certain evenings in a large second-story room
                    near the "bank corner." When Captain Louis Niewerth gruffly barked, "Mark
                    time!" the boys in the company stepped in unison but did not advance. This was new to me
                    then, but I have seen a great deal of "marking time" in all walks of life since
                    that year.
            No doubt, I advanced some in the four years just after leaving Indiana University, but the forward
                    movement was on a level plateau. I had a job with a modest stipend attached, though modest may be an exaggeration. There was a college debt to pay. It was not so big, but the
                    amount by which I could whittle it down annually seemed small indeed.
            My only brother,1 seven years younger than myself, after a severe attack of
                    sciatic rheumatism in 1900, was never well again, though he lived until 1922. For the first two
                    years, he could walk some with difficulty, but after that very little and in time not at all. As his
                    mind remained keen and active through all the years of his misfortune, association with him was a
                    rare privilege. His spirit pervaded the lives of all of the members of our family, and he lived on
                    his interest in our activities and those of his friends and acquaintances. Observing his seemingly
                    unbearable handicap, I dared not notice the small things that stood in my own way.
            Unable to advance to a better salaried position for what seemed a long time,2 I
                    made an effort to render superior service in the work that was mine to do. I seemed to be in a blind
                    alley, but, perhaps in several ways, my second period as a high school teacher was as fruitful as
                    any time of equal length. There was not an adequate library at hand in which to do research, but,
                    even had there been one, my class work was so heavy and my other duties so numerous that I suppose
                        
                  
                     * The first chapter of this autobiography appeared in the
                            issue of March, 1986, and a further chapter has been published in each issue of the Magazine since. The sketches will be continued through the present year.
                  
                     1 Albert Leroy Lynch, born Sept. 20, 1877; died February 20, 1922.
                  
                     2 I received some direct invitations to take positions in other high
                            schools between September, 1903, and September, 1907, but the salary increases were not
                            sufficient to justify acceptance.
               
                     I could have done very little. Under such conditions teachers,
                    like bankers, lawyers, ministers and others, tend to fit into the surroundings and become
                    permanently no bigger than the demands of the situation require them to be.
            In every community, one is in the midst of a social laboratory where plenty of experiments are open
                    for observation to those who have eyes to see. I did not fully sense this, but, while I added
                    something to my knowledge of history each year, I did ponder over the various problems of community
                    living as the days and months went by. One is not likely to be much concerned about the
                    undercurrents of human life as they flow past him unless he has some time for reflection. Even then,
                    unless he has the right turn of mind, he can very soon think himself dry.
            To work several years with high school boys and girls, while living from hand to mouth and performing
                    a never ending round of gratuitous services on the side would not at any time or place appeal very
                    strongly to up-and-coming young men. As one who went through the ordeal, I may be permitted to
                    assert that there are plenty of experiences, commonly regarded as highly desirable, that I think are
                    much worse. Incidentally, I may also interpolate that it is not so easy for me to convince myself
                    that human beings would refuse to struggle for the good of themselves and society if the profit
                    motive were wanting.
            There was much enjoyment connected with working and living in 
                        Elkhart
                    . The long depression, ushered in by the panic of 1893, had passed before 1903, and the
                    beautiful little city located at the point where the Elkhart River flows into
                    the 
                        St. Joseph
                     grew steadily3 The prosperity of the place was due to the shops and
                    yards of the 
                        New York
                     Central system, and to numerous factories. The mass of the population was never too
                    prosperous, but rather steadily employed and able to maintain a fairly good standard of living. The
                    high school grew in numbers partly because of the growth of the city but also because, from year to
                    year, more and more families adopted the idea that their children ought to go to high school.
            There were six class periods each day. Some of the instructors taught five classes and performed
                    assembly-room duty during the other period. I carried six classes and thus

                                Elkhart
                             was 15,184 in 1900 and 19,228 in 1910.
               
                     avoided serving time watching over a large room filled with
                    students who were supposed to study. There was no time or opportunity to guide or direct their work.
                    Supervised study came later.
            History, contrary to a common idea, is a very difficult subject to teach. Any alert teacher can
                    question his students on the content of a certain number of pages in the text book during each
                    recitation, and grade them on their success in reproducing what they have read or studied. However,
                    skillfully this may be done, it leaves much to be desired. The true teacher of history makes it
                    possible for his students to relive the past, and this no one can do who merely knows the lesson as
                    presented in the text-book. If the teacher of history can travel along a familiar path through the
                    events and movements of a period or of the history of a country, he can make that path familiar to
                    his students. He must see the end of the pathway at the beginning, the beginning from the end and
                    have a thorough acquaintance with the slopes, the turns and the objects along the way. To acquire
                    this knowledge and understanding of the history of any period or country, one must read and digest
                    what is read and continue reading and digesting indefinitely. A knowledge of past events and
                    movements, will at least throw light on current happenings and problems, and present events can be
                    constantly used to make intelligible the actions of men and peoples of times that are past.4
            
            By 1903 football had become a sport of much importance in Indiana high schools, in fact, it was the
                    only sport of that period that was apt to bring different high schools into contests with each
                    other. There was much interest in football in 
                        Elkhart
                    , and each year games were arranged with four or five of the neighboring high
                            schools—
                  Goshen, South Bend, Warsaw
               , LaPorte, 
                        Michigan
                     City. Generally there were two games with certain schools on the list. The greatest
                    rivalry existed between 
                        Elkhart
                     and 
                        Goshen
                    . Each year there was a 
                  
                     4 One of the teachers of history associated with me in the 
                                Elkhart
                             High School was Willis L. Card. He was a graduate of Indiana University who had
                            also done some graduate work. He left high school work in the summer of 1906 to go to Clark
                            University where he remained until he received the Ph.D. degree. From 1908 until his death
                            in 1937, he was a professor in the School of Education of 
                                Ohio
                             University at 
                        Athens, Ohio
                     . His successor at 
                                Elkhart
                             was Arthur G. Bobbitt, also a graduate of Indiana University. Mr. Bobbitt
                            became head of the history department when I left 
                                Elkhart
                             in 1908. A few years later he joined the faculty of the 
                                Oak Park
                             and River Forest High School of 
                        Oak
                                Park, Illinois
                     , and
                            still remains there as head of the Department of History. While we were associated as
                            teachers in the high school, Bobbitt was almost always at my side sharing my
                            responsibilities in regard to athletics.
               
                     contest between the two teams at 
                        Goshen
                     and another at 
                        Elkhart
                    . While a high school instructor, I always had some responsibility for athletic teams. I
                    was never a coach, but served often as manager or treasurer, and every year as a general monitor or
                    adviser.
            The last football season of my high school teaching career was that of 1907. During the fall of that
                    year, I was present during every hour when the team practiced and at every game played at home or
                    away. The coach, Ralph Nusbaun, was a young man who had finished high school two or three years
                    earlier, and who was now a cub reporter for the 
                        Elkhart
                     Truth. He had natural ability as a teacher of the game and the players liked him. There
                    were some fine boys on that football squad and they prided themselves on clean playing. Nine games
                    were played during the season. I copied the schedule in the back of the little book in which I kept
                    my cash amount for that year, with the scores, and will here reproduce the record:

            Several of the games were scoreless,5 and only the team 
                  
                     5 It will be noted that except in the first game (where the opposing
                            team was weak), the 
                                Elkhart
                             team did not score until the last three games. Our coach was clearly able to
                            teach defensive tactics, but we needed to develop a better offensive. We had one excellent
                            half-back, stocky and strong and very speedy, whose name was Bedenkop. The other half-back,
                            Howard McCoy, while not so speedy, was alert and always ready to do his part. It seemed to
                            me that we were not using these players to the best advantage. I urged Nusbaum, the young
                            coach, to devise some special plays which he did. One play that helped to improve the
                            offensive power of the team was known among the boys as
                            "11–16," these being the first numbers used when calling
                            signals. It was a double "fake." The punter dropped back as if for a kick,
                            but, on receiving the ball, ran to the right while the right end ran down the field to
                            receive a forward pass. This, of course, drew the back field of the opposing team over to
                            their left. When passing the right half-back the ball was given to him by the full-back (the
                            auarter-back was our punter, who, of course, took the position of full-back), and he ran to
                            the left with the left half-back and left end as interference. We had an excellent line and
                            the trick worked well. It could of course be reversed and the ball carried down the field to
                            the right by the left half-back. I invented the play especially that the speed of Bedenkop,
                            right halfback, might be turned to account. My first idea was simply to have the punter run
                            with the ball, but, when I diagrammed the play, Charles ("Chic") Darling
                            who played right end immediately asked why he could not run down the field as if he were to
                            receive a pass and his suggestion was at once adopted. The play was used with startling
                            effect in the game against 
                                Michigan
                             City on Nov. 9, and again against LaPorte on Thanksgiving Day. The 
                                Goshen
                             players had learned about the play through some one who witnessed the 
                                Elkhart
                            -
                                Michigan
                             City game. I am not certain when scouting became a regular practice, but some
                            "scout" performed efficiently on Nov. 9, 1907.
               
                     of 
                  
                            Winona
                         Academy
               6 defeated the 
                        Elkhart
                     boys. It was a season to be long remembered by students, townspeople and instructors.
                    Neither team scored in the 
                        Elkhart
                    -
                        Goshen
                     game played at 
                        Elkhart
                    , but the contest at 
                        Goshen
                     which came later was different. The 
                        Goshen
                     High School had a fine team and they were out to win when the clash came on their own
                    grounds on November 16. The day was fine and the crowd large. The ground had frozen some on Friday
                    night but by Saturday afternoon the surface of the playing field was slippery because it had become
                    warm enough to thaw during the day. Before the first half ended, 
                        Goshen
                     made a touchdown and also gained the extra point. The 
                        Elkhart
                     team and substitutes were huddled together on a bench in an old shed at one end of the
                    field during the intermission. The coach counseled with the squad for perhaps three minutes and then
                    asked me to say something to the boys. I asked them what was the matter, and they told me that the
                    surface of the field was so "slick" that it was impossible to hold back their
                    opponents who were equipped with new shoes that prevented slipping.
            It seemed that our team was like the Persians at Marathon, only it was a difference in the length of
                    shoe-cleats instead of hand weapons. The team was completely discouraged—overcome by the
                    thin coating of wet, slimy soil that covered the gridiron. To start with, I told the boys that they
                    were fighting a good team that expected to win, "but," I added, "you are
                    a better team and you know it, and you must not let yourselves be defeated." Every boy
                    looked at me sad-eyed and ashamed and nearly all of them spoke together—
                    "It's that mud, Mr. Lynch." "Listen to me, boys," I
                    said, speaking slowly and earnestly, "When this game is over and you are defeated no one
                    will pay any attention to what you say about mud. Everyone will look at the score and nothing else.
                    I want every man of you to forget that there is any mud on that field. Go back there and play the
                    game as you know how to play it, and I am sure the story of the second half will be something to be
                    proud of."
            
               
                  6 The team from the Academy was made up of older and larger boys than we
                        had on our high school team, but the score does not reveal the relative strength of the two
                        elevens. Our team carried the ball almost to the goal line several times. The selection of
                        officials was a hap-hazard matter in that period. Our coach and the coach of the Academy team
                        officiated at this game. Whenever the 
                            Elkhart
                         team was about to score, the coach of the other team became greatly excited and his
                        decisions produced a great deal of controversy. At the end of the game, I walked at his side
                        from the playing field to the Interurban Station (about a mile), to prevent irate
                        "fans" from mobbing him.
            
            
            Very early in the second half, the 
                        Goshen
                     full-back kicked a field goal from about the thirty-yard line, which then counted four
                    points. Score 10 to 0! Supporters of both teams decided that the second half would go like the first
                    only more so, but the tide soon turned. Two smashing drives netted eleven points, and a few minutes
                    later the 
                        Elkhart
                     quarter-back, Roy Riblet, kicked a field goal from the forty-five yard line. Toward the
                    end of the game another drive resulted in a third touchdown, and the contest closed with the score
                    21 to 10 in favor of 
                        Elkhart
                    . I knew those boys thoroughly. I wanted them to play up to their capacity and they did.
                    I have not been able to forget that day and neither have the members of that 1907 team.7 The last contest on the schedule was the return game with LaPorte which came
                    on Thanksgiving Day at 
                        Elkhart
                    , when the season ended with another victory.8
            
            In September, 1902, I took my brother to 
                        Colorado
                     Springs, where he remained for more than two years. One of my sisters was with him for
                    all of that time, and two others for much of it.9 My father and mother spent the
                    winter of 1903–1904 with him. In the summer of 1904, I went back to 
                        Colorado
                     for seven weeks. It was our hope that the dryer climate might enable my brother to
                    overcome his ailment. In the long run, he did not improve, but he did greatly appreciate his stay in
                    the city of 
                        Colorado
                     Springs.
            In 1906, Mrs. Lynch went to 
                        Colorado
                     Springs for the summer, and later I went through that city on a trip to 
                        California
                    . Mr. T. F. A. Connelly, an older brother of my mother, who went to 
                        California
                     in 1853, died in Bishop (then Bishop 
                  
                     7 The splendid performance put on by the 
                                Elkhart
                             team in the second half was not all due to improved morale. As it became colder
                            during the afternoon, the slimy mud stiffened and gave the boys better footing.
                  
                     8 The game with LaPorte, in that city on Oct. 5, was ready to start
                            before the officials were selected. It took but a moment to arrange that Mr. Arthur Deamer,
                            principal of the LaPorte High School, and myself should act as umpire and referee. I
                            don't suppost that any inter-scholastic athletic contest was ever in the hands of
                            more thorough amateurs, but I am sure that we were fair to each other. When Deamer brought
                            the LaPorte team to 
                                Elkhart
                             on Thanksgiving Day, it was apparent to me at once that something had given the
                            visitors an unusual confidence. I learned after the game that Jimmy Sheldon, then football
                            mentor at Indiana University, had been coaching the LaPorte team for several days.
                  
                     9 My eldest sister, Flora M. Lynch, who remained in 
                                Colorado
                             throughout the period that our brother was there, gave up her place in the 
                                Elkhart
                             schools for two and a half years. She returned to 
                                Elkhart
                            , where she taught again until her marriage to Mr. George Wear in 1912. Her
                            husband died in 1916, and she again taught for a time, but has made her home in 
                                Frankfort
                            , Ind., for a number of years. My youngest sister, Bernice E. Lynch, who spent a
                            year and a half in 
                                Colorado
                            , was later married to the Rev. D. W. Scott, a Christian minister who served, in
                            succession, churches in Ashland, Ky., Youngstown, O., and Tampa, Fla. Since the death of her
                            husband at Tampa in 1930, Mrs. Scott has lived in St. 
                                Petersburg
                            . The sister who remained in 
                                Colorado
                             Springs for several years was married to William C. Myers in 1905. They later
                            lived in Gary, Ind., 
                                Wilmington
                            , N. C., and Ashland, Ky. Mr. Myers died in 1933, and my sister (Ida J.) still
                            lives in Ashland.
               
                     Creek), Inyo County, in the early summer of 1906. He visited
                    his native state only once in the long interval, which was in the summer of 1901. He was never
                    married and left a modest estate. The executor, a Mr. Walter Bennett of Bishop, requested the heirs
                    in Indiana and 
                        Kansas
                     to send a representative to confer with himself and the attorney, the outcome of which
                    was that I was asked to make the trip.
            I bought a ticket to 
                        San Francisco
                     and return, with stopovers, for $78.00, and started from Bringhurst,
                    Indiana, on July 28, 1906. I traveled via
                    
                        St. Louis
                     and 
                        Kansas
                     City. I spent the last day of July in 
                        Colorado
                     Springs and left by the 
                        Denver
                     and Rio Grande on August 1. Reaching Salt Lake City in the early afternoon of August 2,
                    I visited the Mormon Tabernacle, a remarkable building, looked at the famous Temple and went out to
                    Saltair Beach. I bathed in Great Salt Lake, a very unique experience. Because of the great amount of
                    mineral matter in the water, one can lie on the surface of the Lake at any depth with no effort
                    whatever.
            After spending the night in Salt Lake City, I ran to Ogden on a local train, leaving there early in
                    the afternoon of August 3 for Hazen, 
                        Nevada
                    , a new and very small town located on the dry, barren plateau not far from Reno, 
                        Virginia
                     City and Carson City.10 Here I took a train for Mina on the line
                    from Hazen to Tonopah and Goldfield. I remained overnight in Mina, as there was no southbound train
                    till the next day. Mina boasted about a dozen crude buildings. There were two large rooms in the
                    front part of the Mina Hotel on the first floor. One was the dining room and the other a room with
                    various gambling devices and a bar. There were at least a hundred men staying at the Hotel nearly
                    all of whom were prospecting for gold on the slopes of the nearby mountains. The manager of the
                    dining room collected fifty cents from each patron after each meal and every one paid in coin. I
                    don't know how much gold the prospectors averaged per day or month, but it was apparent
                    that the gentleman who fed them was operating a small gold mine.
            From Mina southward into eastern 
                        California
                     there was a narrow gauge road, which led into the valley of Owens 
                  
                     10 Hazen is about 50 miles from Carson City and 30 miles from 
                                Virginia
                             City. It is 40 miles east of Reno. I obtained a special round-trip rate from
                            Hazen to Bishop (199 miles between) for $10.95. This was the regular one-way
                            fare, at 5$1/2 cents per mile.
               
                     River in eastern 
                        California
                     and on to Owens Lake, parallel to the Sierra 
                        Nevada
                     Mountains. The railroad missed most of the towns, which were generally about six miles
                    nearer the Sierras. There was one freight train each way daily with a passenger coach attached.
                    Locomotive, freight cars and passenger coach were all very small.11 Arriving at
                    the railway station (Laws), there was a so-called stage which carried passengers to Bishop. The
                    capacity of the stage was about nine persons, but I suppose it was seldom crowded. There were two
                    Missourians who rode into Bishop on that Sunday evening, August 5, 1906, who had been in 
                        Nevada
                     mining camps for twenty years. Their enjoyment, springing from the sight of growing
                    fields of corn on the irrigated lands of the Owens River Valley, was almost pathetic.12
            
            I remained in eastern 
                        California
                     for more than a week, leaving on August 14. The Owens River Valley is a rich, beautiful
                    area, but, located East of the Sierra Nevadas and facing the vast barren stretches of 
                        Nevada
                    , it is very difficult of access.13 Looking west, the people of the
                    valley can always see the high, clear-cut, snow-capped Sierra 
                        Nevada
                     Range for a distance of seventy-five miles to the north and an equal distance to the
                    south. Not far to the east are the White Mountains high enough to be covered with snow in August.
                    The snows were melting so fast when I was in the Valley that the streams were bank full or
                    overflowing into the lower areas of the fields, low stretches of uncultivated tracts, and into the
                    lower portions of roads. The corn crop was maturing, wheat was being threshed, and the honey
                    producers were holding conferences with agents who were negotiating for the summer's
                    output. Alfalfa is the all important grass crop of the area, and the bees work on the flowers of the
                    plant. Owens River Valley suffers from too much water for irrigation purposes rather than too
                    little. Farmers neglect the irrigation 
                  
                     11 The railroad line from Mina to Tonopah Junction, about 20 miles,
                            was used by both standard and narrow gauge trains through the device of a third rail. Such
                            combination lines were not uncommon in the western mountain area.
                  
                     12 There was one good-natured, talkative passenger on the stage who
                            could incorporate in every sentence more picturesque profanity than I believed it possible
                            for any man to find room for. There was an old native on hand who asked a question that I
                            think he was prone to propound to strangers at every opportunity which was—
                            "What direction is 
                                Los Angeles
                             from here?" Bishop being east of the Sierras, some one Quickly
                            answered—"Southwest." "No," said the old man
                            proudly, "It is southeast," and he was correct.
                  
                     13 Two or three years ago I met a student, whose name I do not recall,
                            who told me that he had visited the Owens River Valley. Very recently, I have discovered a
                            printer (O. R. Murnan) employed by the Indiana University Press who drove through the Owens
                            Valley in 1926. I have at no time since 1906, found any one else that ever visited the
                            Valley.
               
                     ditches, and they become lined with willows and heavy growths
                    of weeds: Low places in fields get too much water when it is turned on and high places get none,
                    which means that in some otherwise fine fields there are both swamps and pieces of desert. Areas in
                    the valley where irrigation brings mineral matter to the top that is hostile to plants are not worth
                    much. Non-irrigated stretches, sometimes very extensive, are sandy and barren or covered with
                    stunted shrubs—sage-brush, grease-wood and rabbit-bush. Cemeteries are treated with water
                    and covered with alfalfa, otherwise these burial grounds would be mere parts of the desert.
            The common method of irrigating a field, is not to turn the water into a series of furrows, but to
                    open the gate of the ditch running along one side of the field near the corner and let the water
                    slowly spread over the gently sloping surface. The farmer with hoe in hand walks about as the water
                    spreads, and with the least effort possible opens and closes hundreds of tiny dams one after
                    another. These dams are practically invisible and are only little ridges of soil about two inches
                    high. I watched the process and walked about over an alfalfa field from which a crop had recently
                    been harvested with a man who guided the flow of water by using his hoe. His object was to direct
                    the water so that a reasonable amount would soak into every square yard of soil. By closing ditch
                    gates from time to time along the side of the field and opening others, the whole could be treated
                    in a few hours, then left alone for a week, or ten days, or even more, according to the crop.
            I had no difficulty in transacting the business that I had in hand, and found the executor and
                    attorney for my deceased uncle's estate to be men of intelligence and honesty. To confer
                    with the attorney, I had to go to Independence, the county seat, which was forty miles from Bishop.
                    I took the little train on the narrow gauge railroad, going south on Saturday, August 11, and back
                    to Bishop on Sunday. The fare was $2.20 each way, or five and a half cents per mile. At
                    Independence, I found several old men who had known my uncle well. When I stepped on the stage to go
                    back to the railway station on Sunday forenoon, several of these old-timers surrounded me and urged
                    me to come back. One interesting and weatherbeaten product of a half century of hard  experience, spoke to me very earnestly, saying: "You will be
                    back. Whoever takes a drink of water from Owens River is sure to come here again."
            Several feet from the brick hotel in Independence, a hogshead thickly covered with burlap rested on a
                    small platform about three feet high. The cask was filled with water and persons about the hotel,
                    using a hose, kept the burlap covering well soaked. Being thoroughly exposed to the sun, evaporation
                    went on steadily, especially since the air was quite dry. The drinking water in the hogshead was
                    thus kept refreshingly cold. Indeed the cask with its crude covering was called an "
                        Arizona
                     refrigerator."
            I left Bishop on August 14, stopping overnight again at Mina. The next day I rode on to Hazen, where
                    I soon left for 
                        San Francisco
                     on a through train. This was on the evening of the fifteenth. That night and for four
                    succeeding nights I slept in Pullman berths. Passing over the Sierra 
                        Nevada
                     Range by Truckee Pass, we were near 
                        Sacramento
                     by daylight and arrived at Oakland Pier at 7:00 A.M. I was to start for home at 7 P.M.,
                    so I made the most of my hours in the splendid city which had been visited by a destructive
                    earthquake and a far more destructive fire only three months before.
            The Bay was extremely beautiful on that bright, cold morning as I crossed to the Ferry Building on
                    one of the steamers that plied back and forth from Oakland Pier. After getting breakfast in a busy
                    restaurant, in a new, one-story frame building, one of the temporary structures erected after the
                    fire, I walked entirely across the almost rectangular area of eighty blocks where everything had
                    been destroyed. My interest was active as I went out through the devastated section, but, as I
                    returned to the Ferry Building, I looked neither to the right nor to the left.
            The evidence was unmistakable that the earthquake had played havoc with buildings, sidewalks, and
                    car-tracks in the lower and more level part of the city, and that fire had done the rest. The
                    steel-frame business structures survived the shock, and a vast number of homes in residence
                    districts were not greatly harmed, though most of the chimneys had to be repaired or rebuilt.
                    Enterprising firms had moved to residence streets and were carrying on in dwelling houses. Banners
                         floated above the roofs of these homes, each carrying the
                    name of some department store, clothing firm, or other business. There were still, on August 16, ten
                    thousand or more refugees living in tents on vacant tracts along the outskirts of the city.
            I left Oakland late in the evening of August 17, and reached Pueblo early in. the afternoon of the
                    nineteenth. Mrs. Lynch had come from 
                        Colorado
                     Springs two days earlier to visit relatives, and, after spending a few hours there,14 we traveled together to Phillipsburg, 
                        Kansas
                    , where I left the train, and Mrs. Lynch traveled on to 
                        Chicago
                     and 
                        Elkhart
                    . Taking a train that made more stops, I got off at 
                        Mankato
                     and rode the eleven miles to Jewell City on an accommodation train,15 arriving in that peaceful 
                        Kansas
                     town about noon on August 20. Here my mother's brother, Jeptha Connelly, a
                    veteran of the Civil War, had lived for many years, and I wished to report to him in person in
                    regard to what I had learned about his brother's estate. This side trip gave me an
                    opportunity to drive about some in Jewell County, where I was very favorably impressed with the
                    agricultural outlook.16 Farm prices had recovered since the long depression, but
                    in 1906, good farms could be purchased at fifty dollars an acre.17
            
            From 
                        Mankato
                    , I ran into 
                        Chicago
                    , and from there to the home of my parents in 
                        Carroll County
                    , Indiana. After a business trip to Battle Ground, I returned to 
                        Elkhart
                     to take 
                  
                     14 On that Sunday afternoon my wife and I were taken to a park by her
                            relatives (two young married couples) who wished to show us & good time during the
                            few hours that I was privileged to stop in their city. After we had looked over some of the
                            several attractions on the grounds, we were guided to one side of the park where there was a
                            figure-eight, roller-coaster, a somewhat dilapidated, rickety looking affair. Before we
                            could guess what was coming or protest, one of the young men had bought six tickets. The
                            women folks were hustled into the open cars along: with myself, and the two young husbands
                            followed. Never before had I been taken for such a ride, nor have I ever had the slightest
                            desire to be taken again. The car shot up and down and around at high speed, but it went
                            nowhere and when the ride was over we had accomplished nothing save to risk our lives. I am
                            not in favor of bigger and better roller-coasters; on the contrary, I am for a
                            constitutional amendment prohibiting their construction.
                  
                     15 Quite a few passengers crowded into the one passenger coach on this
                            train, and, since a good deal of switching of freight cars had to be done before the
                            departure of the "accommodation," there was much complaining among the
                            passengers including a variety of sarcastic comments. After a time, I remarked to the most
                            loquacious among the fault-finders that I had recently taken a trip on a worse train. This
                            assertion stirred him deeply, and he came back at me with an explosive
                            "impossible!" adding—"Stranger, I want you to know
                            that this is a tri-weekly train. It goes down one week and tries to get back the
                            next."
                  
                     16 My uncle lived with his daughter Mrs. L. S. (Leta Connelly) Grim,
                            who had several times visited in Indiana. Her husband owned a jewelry store. The drive about
                            the country was made in a spring-wagon with two good horses. The horse and buggy days were
                            not over yet in 1906.
                  
                     17 I developed a land-hunger on that summer day (Aug. 21, 1906) that I
                            have never been able to appease. In 1915, I acquired a piece of land (160 acres) in 
                                Parke County
                            , Indiana, which I disposed of in 1919. Some years later (1931) Mrs. Lynch
                            inherited an eighty-acre farm, and, in recent years, we have acquired more land until now we
                            have a strong toehold on 375 acres, and I wish it were possible to add to our present
                            holdings.
               
                     up my work in the High School. Mrs. Lynch having been invited
                    to fill out a part of a year, when a teacher resigned on account of illness, was continued as a
                    teacher in the lower intermediate grades through the year 1906–1907 and the following
                    year. I did not wish her to take up teaching, but her success was very gratifying and the additional
                    income helped us to overcome some of the obstacles that blocked our progress. I spent the summer
                    session of 1907 as a graduate student at the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                    . Then, after teaching until Janurary 1908, I gave up my job in the 
                        Elkhart
                     High School, and returned to 
                        Madison
                     for further work in the University. I shall write more later relative to my period at 
                        Wisconsin
                    , about the little girl who was born on July 23, 1905, in regard to my experiences at 
                        Harvard
                    , and concerning my thirty years of teaching in three of the four state educational
                    institutions of Indiana.

            The Christian Bowman Family
            GEORGE W. BOWMAN
            
            If it is important that church and state keep careful records of historical facts and incidents, it
                    is vitally more important that the family, the greatest of the three and the foundation of the
                    others, keep careful records. Family Bibles fade and become illegible, fall to pieces, and are lost
                    to posterity. It is a great satisfaction to trace one's forebears back to the time when the
                    land was a trackless wilderness and ascertain to which branch of those early pioneers one belongs,
                    how he is related to the others, and from what type of stock he is descended. Henry Ward Beecher
                    said: "The dry branches of genealogical trees bear many pleasant and curious fruits for
                    those who know how to search after them."
            The surname Baumann (Bowman) is a common one in 
                        German
                    -speaking countries. There have been several changes in the spelling of the name from
                    medieval times to the present. For instance, Buman was used until 1617; then Buwman and Bouwann, until 1650; and later Baumann or Bauman. This last spelling was changed to Bowman in the case of early American members of the family as English officials, in entering
                    court records of legal documents, spelled the Bau as it sounded—that
                    is, Bow. Baughman, Boughman, and Bachman are less frequent
                    spellings.
            All of the early emigrant Baumanns were Palatines of Swiss-
                        German
                     origin, coming from the Rhine district. Although there are records in the early
                    eighteenth century of the landing of relatively few members of this family, Wendell, Christian,
                    George, Daniel, and Hans are mentioned. From 1750 on, the name appears frequently. The lives of
                    those mentioned are closely connected; their sources, arrivals, religion, locations, and dealings
                    being closely associated, as records prove.
            In July, 710, about 3,000 Palatines, having migrated to 
                        Ireland
                    , were sent to 
                        New York
                     as bond servants of the crown under Governor Robert Hunter. They settled at Livingston
                    Manor and on the opposite side of the Hudson at Saugerities or Schoharie, a tract voluntarily
                    presented to Queen Anne by Indian sachems for the homeless Palatines. Because of their condition of
                    servitude at the first two places mentioned  and because of
                    refusal to let them leave, some fifty families fled to Schorie in the fall of 1712 and the rest
                    followed in March, 1713. Hardly established in the several settlements, they again found themselves
                    in trouble with the "Gentleman in 
                        Albany
                    ." Continual conflicts made life a burden in Schorie; and despairing of justice
                    in 1722, a large number accepted offers from 
                        Pennsylvania
                     to settle there.
            About two-thirds of the Schoharie people were not willing to buy land or settle on the Mohawk at the
                    Governor's pleasure, so they started for 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . From Schoharie they cut through the forests to the head waters of the Susquehana,
                    working down the river to the mouth of the Swatara and then ascended this river to the mouth of the
                    Tulpehocken, where they settled. This was then the most remote outpost of white colonization in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . During this period many other Palatines sailed directly from Rotterdam and Amsterdam
                    or came on ships touching these ports en route from 
                        England
                     and bound for 
                  New York, Boston
               , or 
                        Philadelphia
                    . Some setting out for one destination landed at another after many weary weeks of
                    buffeting.
            Jost (Joist) Hite (Heydt), setting out from Strassburg, the principal town of Alsace in 1710, landed
                    at 
                        New York
                     with sixteen families in Brigatine Swift and Schooner
                        Friendship, ships built or purchased by Hite for this journey. They then went to Kingston.
                    In 1716 or 1717 Hite and the families with him settled at 
                        Germantown
                    , near 
                        Philadelphia
                    . Becoming angry with the Governor of the province, partly because he would not give
                    protection from the Indians, Hite purchased land in 1731 from the 
                        Van
                    -Meters in 
                        Virginia
                    , and, in 1732, he with his family, his sons-in-law, Jacob Chrisman, George Bowman and
                    their families started from York, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , for the Shenan-doah Valley of 
                        Virginia
                    —sixteen family groups in all. Other families were migrating to the Valley.
                    Christian Bowman entered land in 1731 or 1732. Cutting their road through the forests, they crossed
                    the Potomac near Harper's Ferry and entered the rich and beautiful valley. Hite settled
                    near 
                        Winchester
                    ; Christian Bowman, near Edenburg; some, near the present Stephens City; and others, at
                    distances of a few miles apart down the valley. The later towns of Strasburg  and Shepherdstown were founded by Peter Stover and a man named Shepherd
                    or Schaeffer.1
            
            Christian Bowman, ancestor of the writer, was a native of the vineyard section of the Rhenish
                    Palatinate. According to word of mouth, he and George Bowman, Hite's son-in-law, and
                    probably Wendell Bowman, were related. So far the parentage of Christian has not been established
                    nor the name of his wife ascertained. Tradition tells us that Christian and George came from York (
                        Pennsylvania
                    ) into the Shenandoah Valley of 
                        Virginia
                     at the same time and perhaps they had been together throughout their travels. Court
                    records show the purchase of land by Christian Bowman in May 1737; probate records show his will in
                    1764 and there are other ferefences to him and his neighbors.
            The Bowman family was Lutheran. In early times it had belonged to the Reformed Church, but lated it
                    accepted both of these religions and the Anabaptist, Mennonite, and primitive Baptist (Dunker) in
                    addition. The older members of this family today are Reformed Presbyterians. The occupation of the
                    Bowmans of earlier times was chiefly farming, but today they may be found as representative citizens
                    in practically every walk of life. We find also that war records contain the names of members of the
                    Christian Bowman family. In the Revolutionary War those of the first generation of Palatine
                    emigrants were listed; in the Civil War we find them in both the northern and the southern
                    armies—the proverbial brother against brother. In the Spanish and World Wars they were
                    represented, some again making the supreme sacrifice.
            Christian Bowman, born in Europe, came to the Shenandoah Valley, 
                        Virginia
                    . He purchased land from William Russell, May 26, 1737. He obtained 675 acres south of
                    Strasburg on the south side of North River at the mouth of Trembling Run. He established a home and
                    spent the rest of his life as a farmer. Later he purchased other land, and at the time of his death,
                    about Jan., 1764, he possessed much real estate. His wife preceded him in death.
            
               
                  1 Census of 1790, 
                            Pennsylvania
                        , under heads of families, gives: Daniel and Christian Bowman, 
                            Lancaster
                         Co.; Christian Bowman, Dauphin Co.; Christopher Bowman and Christopher Bowman, Jr.,
                        Berks Co.; Christian Bowman, 
                            Northampton
                         Co.; Christian Bowman, York Co. The difficulty of keeping the Christian Bowmans
                        straight is enhanced by the number bearing the name.
            
            
            
                    Children
                
            Jacob Bowman—m. Elizabeth Keller (?); d. 1774 (possibly not till 1778). Lived for a while
                    at and near Strasburg, Va. His wife was administratrix of his will. His children were Peter and
                    Jacob. His widow, Elizabeth, m. Philip Huffman of Strasburg.
            Henry Bowman—d. 1814. Lived on land allotted him in the division of his father's
                    estate on the south side of the river, opposite Narrow Passage. Children: Isaac, Elizabeth,
                    Benjamin, Stephen, Rebecca, John, and Henry, Jr.
            Daniel Bowman—d. 1826; m. Anna Marie (Mary) Wake-man, Dec. 22, 1774. Anna Maria was the
                    daughter of Conrad Wakeman. Children: Henry, Benjamin, Jacob, Samuel, Barbara, Christian, Joseph,
                    George, Daniel, Anne. (Certified Revolutionary record for Daniel).
            Christian Bowman, Jr., lived for a time on land willed him by his father, being part of the 675 acre
                    tract near Strasburg. Litle is now known of him. (Record from War Department, for Revolutionary War
                    service).
            David Bowman lived between Woodstock and Edinburg on land received from his father (now owned by the
                    Huff-mans). This he sold to Phillip Hoffman (Huffman) and is supposed to have lived many years
                    afterwards on land owned by the late John Barton, east of 
                        Hamburg
                    . David had a son, John (d. 1849), who lived at same place as his father. John left a
                    will (Will Book Y, page 411), dated 1847 and probated 1849.
            Benjamin Bowman received one-third of a 525 acre tract opposite Narrow Pass.2 Was
                    killed by Indians.
            Samuel Bowman (no record).
            John Bowman received one-third of 525 acres opposite Narrow Pass. He married
                    Barbara—–and died prior to 1816 or 1818. (Will Book Y, page 115-8 names
                    children).
            Mag[d]alene Bowman (no record).
            Catherine Bowman married Jacob Stover, brother of Peter Stover, founder of Strasburg. Her children
                    were: a daughter (married Reuben Boehm), Barbara, John, Christian.
            It is possible and likely that the first Christian Bowman was buried in the old cemetery located at
                    Harmony Hall on the old Bowman Fort farm. True copy of will of

                     Christian Bowman is on file in the Clerk's office of
                    Frederick County, 
                        Virginia
                    .3
            
            The plantation where Jacob Bowman was living was bequeathed to him by the will of Christian Bowman
                    and the plantation on which the father was living he gave to Christian Bowman, Jr. These two sons
                    were to "pay to the rest of their brothers and sisters so much back as to all share
                    equal." The children named in the will were: Christian, John, Daniel, Henry, Benjamin,
                    Samuel, Catherine, and Magdalene. Executors named were: Jacob Bowman, Peter Stover, Henry Funk, and
                    Jacob Stover (son-in-law). The witnesses who signed the will were: Simon Harr, Hennich Funk, and
                    Peter Staufer [Stover] Jr. The maker of the will signed his name Chrystian Bowman.
            At a court held for Frederick County, February 7, 1764, there were present Henry Funk and Jacob

            The Ross-Welles Family
            WILLIAM ROSS TEEL
            
            Our family Bible has a record of the marriage of Ephraim Ross to Annah Welles at Gilead Church,
                    Hebron, 
                        Connecticut
                     on April 20, 1786. These persons were my maternal great-grandfather and
                    great-grandmother.
            The Welles family has been traced back to Adam De Welles, Baron, who was born in Lincolnshire, 
                        England
                    , about 1265. He was summoned to Parliament on February 6, 1299, and made a Baron; also
                    he was appointed constable of Rockingham Castle and warden of its forests. He died in 1311.
            As Baron he was allotted the Welles coat of arms, which was a lion rampant, sable with tail forked,
                    and motto Semper Paratus, meaning "Always Prepared." We trace
                    our Welles ancestry from him down to Thomas Welles I, who was born in Dudley, Worcestershire, 
                        England
                    , January 10, 1694. Thomas Welles I, with his father, sailed from 
                        England
                     to America in 1712, landing at Saybrook, 
                        Connecticut
                    . There he was married on "ye 13th of May, 1716," to Elizabeth
                    Merrill. In 1735 he moved to Gilead Parish, Hebron, 
                        Connecticut
                    , purchased land, reared a large family, and died on February 4, 1760, aged 66 years.
                    His wife, Elizabeth Welles, passed away at Hebron on December 2, 1770. Thomas and Elizabeth Merrill
                    Welles had seven sons. One, Thomas II (our line), was born in Hebron on August 27, 1723, where he
                    lived the rest of his days. In the old Church of 
                        England
                     graveyard at Hebron, I copied this epitaph from his gravestone.
            
                    In memory of Thomas Welles, who died September ye 1st 1805 aged 82 years and
                        three days
                    
                        Full four score years I saw—
                    
                    
                        But held this world in Vane—
                    
                    
                        Resigned to natures law—
                    
                    
                        Immortal life to gain.
                    
                
            Thomas Welles (II) was married at Hebron, 
                        Connecticut
                    , in the Gilead Church on November 8, 1743, to Thankful Rowles, who bore him two
                    children and died April 28, 1750. He later married Prudence Shipman on November 14, 1750.
            The town of Hebron was incorporated in 1707, the site being purchased from Joseph Uncas, an Indian
                    Sachem.
            
            Thomas Welles, the elder, was Captain of the town's first militia, and Captain John W.
                    Welles, his brother, was one of a committee to divide the parish into school districts (Town Record,
                    60).
            Bateman Welles, our ancestor, was the son of Thomas and Thankful Rowles Welles. He was born in Hebron
                    and was evidently a man of substantial means for the time. He held many offices in the parish. He
                    was married on February 12, 1769, to Annah Carter. There were seven children by this marriage. The
                    first child, Annah Welles, born November 18, 1769, was our ancester.
            The first land entry in the name of Bateman Welles (Vol. 6, p. 272) is a deed to him of twenty and
                    one-half acres from Mercy Post, dated February 8, 1776, and acknowledged before John Ashley, Jun.,
                    Justice of the Peace. He sold this parcel of land on November 4, 1793, to Shipman Welles (his son)
                    for twenty pounds. In 1788 he bought sixty-two acres of Thomas Welles II (Vol. 8, p. 66), and sold
                    this land for two hundred thirty pounds in 1793.
            Annah Welles, my maternal great-grandmother, was married to Ephraim Ross at Gilead Church, Hebron, 
                        Connecticut
                    , on April 20, 1786; she was at the time not quite twenty years old. By this union there
                    were eleven children. The third child, Russell Ross, was my grandfather. He was born on April 16,
                    1791, at 
                  Cambridge, New York
               , a small town near the 
                        Vermont
                     state line.
            The Ross family was from 
                        Scotland
                    , and Ephraim's father, Alexander Ross, served in the British Navy. He was
                    stationed at 
                        Halifax
                    , N. S.; his army record shows that he was appointed Second Lieutenant of the
                    Twenty-third Company of Marines, Feb. 25, 1755, and became successively First Lieutenant and Captain
                    of an independent foot-company which, however, was disbanded in 1768, when he was placed on half
                    pay. The family always insisted that he was lost at sea. The tradition was that Ephraim Ross when a
                    boy ran away from 
                        Halifax
                     in the winter time and was picked up in a starving condition by Indians with whom he
                    wintered, afterwards coming to 
                        New York
                    . It is evident that after their marriage Ephraim and Annah (Welles) Ross moved to 
                        New York
                    , as their son Russell was born in 
                  Cambridge, New York
               .
            Land entries show that Ephraim Ross resided and  owned property
                    at Onondaga Court House, 
                        New York
                    , a few miles south of 
                        Syracuse
                    . The land was on the Onondaga Indian reservation, and the title was acquired by the 
                        United States
                     some time near 1800. I have located exactly, by county deed records at 
                        Syracuse
                    , the land on which the Ross family lived. The house, of course, disappeared long ago.
            It may be interesting to tell why the family emigrated to Indiana. Just prior to the war with Great
                    Britain in 1812, Ephraim Ross with the help of his brawny sons took a contract to,build a brick
                    schoolhouse for the commissioners at Onondaga Court House. This family were brick-makers and
                    carpenters. When war was declared, the building was about half done; and Ephraim found that on
                    account of the war, living, labor, and material so greatly advanced in price that if he were to
                    finish the building, it would ruin him financially. He went to the commissioners, explained his
                    predicament, and offered to give them the building half completed if they would release him from the
                    contract. After a lengthy conference, he was told to proceed with the building, and that he should
                    have a fair profit. He mortgaged or sold part of his holdings to pay for material and labor, thus
                    finishing the building, whereupon the commissioners repudiated their verbal promise and held him to
                    the contract. As a consequence, he lost practically everything he had.
            The next four years must have been hard ones. The family was large, six boys and four girls, and some
                    of the children were very young. The third son, John Ross, came to Indiana sometime after 1815 and
                    located at 
                        Vincennes
                    . The family decided to join him, gathered together their few belongings, and went to 
                        Pittsburgh
                     in the late fall of 1818. The entire family with the exception of John Ross and
                    possibly Russell took a keelboat down the Ohio River, and opposite 
                        Wheeling
                    , West 
                        Virginia
                    , the boat was frozen in the ice for most of the winter. They probably landed at
                    "Yellow Banks," as 
                  Henderson,
                            Kentucky
               , was then called, and traveled
                    overland to 
                        Vincennes
                    .
            The family, with the exception of John, after a time went across the Wabash
                    River to 
                  Crawford County, Illinois
               . They did not prosper there, as the soil was
                    "crawfish ground," wet and marshy. The entire family had chills and ague. 
                        Terre Haute
                     on the Fort Harrison prairies in 
                    
                        Vigo County
                    , Indiana, had been founded in 1816. Glowing reports of the place caused the Ross family
                    to move there in 1821.
            The children of Ephraim and Annah Welles Ross came with regularity, it appears: Bate (Bateman), 1789;
                    Betsey, 1791; Russell, 1793; Polly Ann, 1795; Nancy, 1797; John, 1799; Harry, 1801; James, 1803;
                    Sally Anne, 1807; Alexander, 1809; Emeline, 1812. It is noticeable that several of the names come
                    from the Welles family—Bateman, Betsy, Russell, Polly Ann and Sally Anne.
            Ephraim Ross spent the rest of his life at 
                        Terre Haute
                     and died there on September 29, 1850, at the age of 93 years. His wife Annah passed
                    away fifteen days later, also aged 93 years. Both are buried in an old cemetery at 
                        Terre Haute
                    .
            Quoting The History of 
                            Terre Haute
                        
                by 
                        Blackford
                     Condit: "The Ross family came here before 1824. Their names appear among
                    trades and tradesmen as the first brickmakers of the town. The second Court House was made of brick,
                    and it is a well authenticated fact that in an early day, the Ross Brothers made the brick of the
                    town." Russell, Harry, and James, however, in due time engaged in merchandising. They had a
                    store on the west side of the square where they sold calico at twenty-five cents a yard like their
                    brother merchants.
            Members of the Ross family were Presbyterians and were among the first to become members of the first
                    Presbyterian Church to be organized in 
                        Terre Haute
                    . Ephriam Ross and his son Alexander joined the Presbyterian Church on May 2, 1832. The
                    Congregational Church was organized in 
                        Terre Haute
                     on Dec. 30, 1834, by the Rev. Merrick A. Jewett, and among the members were Russell and
                    Alexander Ross; so it appears that some of the Ross family withdrew from the Presbyterian Church and
                    affiliated with the Congregational Church thereafter.
            Russell Ross, my grandfather, married Elizabeth Almey (Aimey) in 
                        Vincennes
                     on Jan. 29, 1823. She was said to be of French descent, and some of the family spelled
                    the name "Aimee." She was born in Ovid, 
                        New York
                    , a quaint, little, old town midway between Lake Cayuga and Lake Seneca, the prehistoric
                    home of the two most westerly tribes of the original five nations, the Cayugas and the Senecas. It
                    appears her family must have migrated to 
                        Vincennes
                    , as she  married Russell Ross there. In order to
                    distinguish Elizabeth Almey Ross, who was called "Betsy," after her sister-in-law,
                    Betsy Ross, she was known as Betsy Russell. After the death of Russell Ross on Oct. 23, 1841,
                    Elizabeth, his widow, lived in a house on the east side of Fifth Street, north of Cherry Street in 
                        Terre Haute
                    , with her son Rea Ross and her daughter Isabel Russell Ross, who later married Frank
                    Gulick, a druggist. Elizabeth died on Jan. 28, 1858. The children of Russel and Elizabeth Almey Ross
                    were:
            
               Emilie R. Ross—b. Mar. 7, 1825.
               Jesse Harvey Ross—b. Sept. 11, 1826; d. in infancy.
               Welles Ross—b. Apr. 9, 1829; d. in infancy.
               Henry Ross—b. Dec. 29, 1830; d. in infancy.
               Hellen Ross—b. Feb. 13, 1833; d. in infancy.
               Rea Ross—b. Feb. 24, 1834.
               Hellen Elizabeth Ross—b. Feb. 2, 1840; d. in infancy.
               Isabel Ross—b. Jan. 24, 1841.
            
            Emilie R. Ross married Henry Helms Teel in 
                        Terre Haute
                     on Dec. 27, 1842, when she was not quite eighteen years old. His father, John Teel,
                    came to Indiana from Blount County, 
                        Tennessee
                    , about 1820. At that time Indiana, having recently been admitted to the Union in 1816,
                    had no roads fit for wagon travel. Indian trails used by early emigrants were
                    "blazed" between points of travel through an unbroken wilderness. It is barely
                    possible that the family came up to 
                  Knoxville,
                            tnu
               , and embarked from there on flat
                    boats, which were used in those days, for the long journey down the Tennessee
                    River to the 
                        Ohio
                    , which it joins at Paducah, 
                        Kentucky
                    . The tradition is that the trip was made overland from 
                        Kentucky
                     to a location in 
                        Owen County
                    , Indiana, near 
                        Spencer
                    . As horses were scarce and high in price, it is not likely that they could have
                    transported their belongings and given each a mount, so the women rode and the men walked.
                    Father's sister Adeline told me that she recalled having ridden horseback in front of her
                    mother on this trip.
            The Teel family, shortly after arrival, located at Cataract Falls on Mill Creek, a fork of Eel River
                    in 
                        Owen County
                    . John Teel built the first grist-mill in that part of Indiana. In connection with
                    grinding corn and wheat, he added a sawmill, using the same power. The land was being cleared, and
                    lumber was in much demand for building the homes of the settlers, who were arriving rapidly at that
                    time. For many  years there lay in the bed of the Creek just
                    below the Falls near where the mill was located a small mill-stone, or burr, from the ruins of the
                    mill. It was my intention to have it taken to my home, but the ground was purchased by General Lew
                    Wallace, who took the stone to his home in 
                        Crawfordsville
                     where it remains today.
            John Teel was a private in the East 
                        Tennessee
                     Volunteers and probably served in the War of 1812. His company was commanded by Captain
                    James Gillespie. The discharge, dated January 15, 1814, was as follows: "This is to certify
                    that John Teel, a private in my company of East 
                        Tennessee
                     Volunteers, has performed a tour of duty commencing on the Twenty-third day of
                    September, 1813, and ending on the first of January, 1814, and his hereby discharged,"
                    signed, "James Gillespie, Capt. E. T. Volunteers." The following from Memoirs of Andrew 
                            Jackson
                        , published by 
                        Putnam
                     Waldo in 1819, would seem to indicate that this discharge was from service in the
                    Creek-Seminole war: 
                        Andrew Jackson was appointed Major General of Militia in 1796, and was acting in this
                            capacity, when in 1812, Congress authorized raising a Volunteer Corp of 50,000 men to serve
                            one year of enlistment. Late in 1813 occurred the Creek uprising and the massacre at Fort
                            Minns, and the 
                                Tennessee
                             militia men, veterans of the late war with Great Britain, were called into
                            service by Governor Blount to serve one year within two years after enlistment. This army
                            consisted of two Divisions, one of West 
                                Tennessee
                            , commanded by Major General Andrew 
                                Jackson
                            , the other East 
                                Tennessee
                             commanded by Major General Cocke.
                    
            
            Levi Teel, an uncle of John Teel, served as a volunteer with General George Rogers Clark at the time
                    of his expedition into the Northwest Territory and capture of 
                        Kaskaskia
                     and 
                        Vincennes
                    , and was awarded as a private one hundred eight acres of land in the Clark Grant in
                    Indiana for this service.
            John Teel's wife, Rebecca (Skidmore) Teel, passed away several years after the events just
                    noted, and he married a second time. The new wife, it is claimed, was not kind to the children. At
                    any rate, Henry Teel ran away when a lad and came to 
                        Terre Haute
                    , where he lived in the family of Judge Amory Kinney. The judge educated him, and, as he
                    was very studious, he acquired a good education for the time. He later became a school teacher.
                    Following his marriage to Emily (Emilie) Ross, the young couple moved to 
                        Carlisle
                    ,  Indiana, where Henry taught school. Later they
                    lived in 
                        Terre Haute
                    , where he taught school at the "Old Benny Hayes" schoolhouse on North
                    Third Street for a time.
            Henry Teel died in Sunset, 
                        Texas
                    , in 1891, and his widow (Emily Ross Teel) died in 
                        Terre Haute
                     on May 7, 1911, aged eighty-six years and two months. She was born near 
                        Terre Haute
                    , east of where the County Infirmary is now located, and resided there almost her entire
                    lifetime.
            In the eighteen-twenties, Indians, probably Miamis, often came down the 
                        Wabash
                     in canoes, and the squaws sold hazel-nuts, moccasins, and beeded work to the villagers
                    in 
                        Terre Haute
                    . Emily Ross had very red hair, which is greatly admired by the squaws. They would stop
                    at the log house, and her mother would let them take the child and place her on a blanket under the
                    trees, so they could admire her hair and clothes. One time they gave her two beaded purses,
                    beautifully made, lined with Bayeta cloth. I have them among my relics. Bayeta cloth was the
                    material used. The scarlet uniforms of the British officers of those days were unraveled by squaws
                    and the thread was rewoven in decorating moccasins and lining beaded bags.
            The children of Henry and Emily Ross Teel were: Anna, Grace, Frank, and William Ross. Anna Teel
                    married Horace G. Burt. There were two children by this marriage, Russell Ross Burt and Arthur Burt.
                    Grace Teel married John A. Tenney of 
                  Madison,
                            Wisconsin
               , and died at Juneau, 
                        Alaska
                    , on Feb. 1, 1900. Frank Teel married Mary Craig. There were no children. William Ross
                    Teel, the writer of this family history, married Katherine West at 
                        Terre Haute
                     in 1894. Two children were born to this union, William Ross Teel, Jr., who died in
                    infancy, and a daughter who still lives.
            There are few members of the Ephraim Ross family in 
                        Terre Haute
                     and 
                        Vigo County
                     today. The family was once among the most prominent of the County. The only living
                    members of the family besides myself and son that I know of are: 
                        Mrs. James McCall, daughter of Julia Ross Perdue, lives in 
                                California
                            . Mrs. McCall has three children, Dorothy, Alexander, and Mrs. William Halstead.
                            Mrs. Halstead lives in 
                                Louisville
                            , Ky.
                        Sadie Gulick, daughter of Isabelle Ross Gulick, lives in Pasadena, Cal.
                        Sue Ross Hendricks, daughter of Edward Ross, lives in 
                                Oak Park
                            , 111., and has two children, Victor and Ross Hendricks.
                        Harry Ross, son of Edward Ross, lives in Sullivan, Ind. He married Maude Reed, and they have
                            two children, Verne and Reed.
                    
            
         
         
         
            Queries and Answers
            Query 50: FAWCETT FAMILY
            
            Information is wanted about the family of Jonah Fawcett, who moved from 
                        Virginia
                     to Tuscarawas County, 
                        Ohio
                    , near New 
                        Philadelphia
                    . Jonah Fawcett was married twice but the name of his first wife is not known. He was a 
                        Quaker
                     but married out of the Church. His second marriage was to Phebe Ann Smith (names of her
                    parents not known). Children of this second marriage were thirteen in number, but seven died in
                    childhood. The others were: Phinias, Hannah, Hester, Flora, Verden (died in Urichsville, 
                        Ohio
                    ), and John Thomas (a teacher, who married Elizabeth Matson). Descendants of the Fawcett
                    family in Indiana may be able to give records of this family.—P.J.
            Query 51: GAITHEK FAMILY
            
            John Gaither was born in 1752 in 
                        Virginia
                    , served in the Revolutionary War as Lieutenant under Gen. Gates at Camden, and was with
                    Gen. 
                        Greene
                     at the battle of Eutaw Springs. He died in Harrison Co., Ind., in 1825. Mary Perry
                    became his wife. The location of their graves and names of all their children are
                    wanted.—L.B.E.
            Query 52: GLOVER FAMILY
            
            Uriah Glover, Sr., is buried in the Trimble graveyard in N. E. Twp., 
                        Orange
                     Co., Ind. He died June 11, 1830, age 89 years. His wife was Elizabeth Robinson, and she
                    is burried there also. The children are Uriah, m. Priscilla Gaddis; Hannah, m. Nelson Combs;
                    Rebecca, m. William Case; Elizabeth, m. Abram Lucas; Jonah, m. Fanny Boyd; Susan; Charles; John, m.
                    Malinda Green; Stephen, m Sarah Kirkham; Ruth, m. William Reed. The Glover family went to Ky. from
                    Penn.; they later came to Ind. It is thought Uriah Glover served with Va. or Penn. troops, perhaps
                    with both. Definite proof of this service is wanted—M.E.M.
            Query 53: CUNNINGHAM-SMITH FAMILY
            
            William Cunningham died on July 23, 1839, aged 75 years; he is buried in Trimble graveyard, 
                        Orange
                     Co., Ind. His will, dated July 14, 1833, mentions his wife, Deborah (
                        Boone
                    ), his daughter, Anna, his daughter, Elizabeth, who married John Buchanan. Proof wanted
                    that William Cunningham  served in the Revolutionary War. The
                    same proof is wanted for Humphrey Smith, whose wife, Abigail, is said to have been a sister of
                    Deborah 
                        Boone
                     Cunningham. Humphrey Smith died in 1839 and was buried at Stampers Creek Baptist Church
                    Cemetery. The children are: Margaret, Caleb, Jarvis, Allen, and Malissa Ann. Deborah and Abigail 
                        Boone
                     are said to have been daughters of Hezekiah 
                        Boone
                    . Data wanted for the D. A. R. State Roster of Revolutionary Soldiers—M.E.M.

            James Blythe, the first president of 
                        Hanover
                     College, Ind., came from Transylvania College at 
                        Lexington
                    , Ky. He was born in 1765, died 1842, and buried at 
                        Hanover
                    . His wife, Margaret, was born in 1798 and died in 1842. The parentage and early life of
                    James Blythe is wanted, also any military service he may have given.—M.H.
            Query 55: WILLIAM WILLIAMS FAMILY
            
            William Williams, signer of the Declaration of Independence, was born on April 18, 1731, in Conn.,
                    and died on August 2, 1811. He married Mary Trumbull (second daughter of Gov. Jonathan Trumbull),
                    and they had three children: Solomon, b. Jan. 6, 1772, d. 1810, N. Y.; Faith, b. Sept. 29, 1774, and
                    m. John McClellan; William, b. Mar. 2, 1779, and m. Sarah Trumbull (cousin). Ephraim Williams, b.
                    Feb. 24, 1715, and d. Sept. 8, 1755, and his brother, Dr. Thomas Williams, b. Apr. 1, 1718, and d.
                    Sept. 28, 1775. Descendants of this line want relationship to the line of 
                        Newton
                    , Mass.—E.C.G.
            Answer to Query 3 (Sept., 1936, p. 309, I.H.M.) The Query concerning the Ashbrooks has been called to
                    my attention. I have much material on Aaron Ashbrook, son of John and Esther (who later married
                    Rezin Howard as her second husband). Aaron married Hannah (Chew?), and I have a nearly complete
                    record of Aaron Ashbrook; I am glad to be of service if you care to pay for the typing of these
                    records.—Miss Genevieve L. Potts, 1184 Oak St., 
                  Columbus, Ohio
               .
            Answer to Query 14 (December, 1936, p. 134, W.C.C.) The record of Elisha Adams, copied largely from
                    the first  Court Order Book of Johnson Co., Ind., indicates
                    relationship to the 
                        Campbell
                     family of this query. The son of Elisha Adams was named William 
                        Campbell
                     Adams, and the wife of James 
                        Campbell
                     was Nancy Adams. The Adams family lived in Blue River Township, Johnson Co., which
                    joins 
                        Bartholomew
                     and 
                        Shelby
                     Co., Ind., where the Campbells lived. Elisha Adams came from Pa. to Ky., and later to
                    Johnson Co., Ind. His wife was Jane, and he died intestate in Johnson Co. in 1824. The heirs with
                    the wife were: John Adams (m. Margaret); William 
                        Campbell
                     Adams (m. Allie, who died May 25, 1862, aged 61 yrs., 5 mo., 23 days—perhaps

                    , Ind.
            Answer to Query 40 (Sept., 1937, p. 369, L. P. G.) A visit was made Jan. 2, 1938 to the 
                        Hamburg
                     Cemetery near

                    , Clark Co., Ind., and we found no tombstone bearing the name of Robert Hunt Prewitt.
                    Mr. William H. Dougherty, who lives in that neighborhood, is now trying to find the grave. He has
                    visited another old cemetery nearby but found no grave marked by the name. He thinks in all
                    probability Robert Hunt Prewitt was buried in the 
                        Hamburg
                     cemetery as an old church history shows his name as one of the charter members of this
                    church, now located in Sellersburg, Indiana. "The old Christian Church, of brick, was
                    erected in 1838. Among its first members were William Wells, John Bloor, Robert Pruett, John Adams,
                    and a number of the Littells. Absolem Littell was the first preacher." (Quoted from the
                    History of the old 
                        Hamburg
                     Church). Another search will be made at this cemetery by Mr. Dougherty and the
                    caretaker. It seems possible that the tombstone, if one had even been placed at this grave, may have
                    been destroyed in some way.—Miss Lulie Davis,

                    families several times (pp. 310–11). They were descendants of Abraham and Susan (Wilson
                    Kern). Abraham, born in Nicholas Co., Ky., 1786, died in Lawrence Co., Indiana, 1858. He and his
                    wife came to Lawrence Co., Indiana, in 1816. He was one of the pioneer preachers of the state and
                    was the founder of the White River Union Church. Adam Sears, born in Nicholas Co., Ky., in 1818, was
                    the son of David and Anna Kern Sears (p. 313). David Sears, born in N. C., 1792, when ten years of
                    age went to Ky. and in 1818 he went to Ind., settling later in Lawrence Co., Ind., where he died.

            Rev. William Hunt was one of the early circuit riders of the Methodist Church in Indiana. He began
                    his work in 
                        Randolph
                     County, Indiana, about 1815. His father, Basil Hunt, was in East 
                        Tennessee
                    , that part which later became 
                        Washington
                     County, and signed the petition of 1787 for separation from 
                        North Carolina
                    . I believe that he and his parents may have come from Hampshire County, 
                        Virginia
                    . I would appreciate any information concerning them. Basil Hunt, born 1765, according
                    to the Bible record, was the son of John Wesley Hunt.
            The Bible containing the above record was published by J. Emory and B. Waugh, for the Methodist
                    Episcopal Church, at the Conference Office, 14 Crosby Street, 
                        New York
