            <p>In view of the present movement to provide a memorial to Abraham Lincoln and his mother in Indiana,
                    it would seem an appropriate time to recall the part taken by this State in the nomination of
                    Lincoln for the presidency thirty years after he crossed the <placeName>

            <p>The political importance of the Old Northwest in 1860 was without doubt a factor which carried much
                    weight in the selection of the Republican candidate for president. "It should be well
                    understood," wrote a correspondent of the <hi rend="i">

                    electoral votes of the <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> states, was indeed one which could not be ignored.</p>
            <p>The position of Indiana in the Old Northwest and in the nation was, from a political standpoint,
                    relatively of greater importance than it is today. With an-electoral vote of thirteen and,
                    consequently, with twenty-six votes in the Republican National Convention, Indiana ranked second
                    among the States of the Old Northwest, being exceeded only by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. She ranked fifth in this respect among the States of the Union, possessing the same

            <p>In the four preceding presidential elections, the electoral vote of the State had been given to the
                    Democratic candidates. In 1856, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
                    </placeName> carried <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but failed to carry Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The Republican Party might reasonably count, in 1860, upon carrying the same three
                    States in the Old Northwest and the eight other <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
                    </placeName> States of 1856. Forty additional electoral votes were needed to win the election. These
                    must come largely from those doubtful states, of which Indiana was one, that had returned Buchanan
                    majorities four years before. It was pointed out that the electoral votes of Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> would, if secured, give exactly the number needed. If <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> should be won by the Democrats, then the votes of Indiana, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="nju">New

               </placeName> (if admitted in time), and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> would be required by the Republicans in order to win.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Hence it
                    became important to nominate a candidate acceptable to the doubtful states. It was this fact which
                    rendered the position of Indiana a strategic one in 1860. Lincoln recognized this after his
                    nomination. "We might succeed in the general results without Indiana," he wrote
                    Caleb Smith, "but with it failure is scarcely possible."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    Others were fully aware of the same thing before the candidates were named, and therein lies the
                    reason for the readiness to listen to the wishes of the State in the matter of the nomination.</p>

                    1859: "It is conceded that Indiana must be carried next year to render the election of a
                    Republican President beyond a contingency. It may possibly be accomplished without her vote, but
                    with it success may be regarded as certain."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                        </placeName> Daily Atlas</hi> went even farther. "There are four free states which

                    </placeName> tried to obtain it.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Prior to the assembling of this historic
                    gathering in May, 1860, there was the usual discussion of candidates. Perhaps never before had this
                    been more earnest or the interest more widespread. In Indiana, the particular form which it assumed
                    was conditioned by the character of the Republicanism which had rooted itself in the State. Here, in
                    its leadership, in its platform pronouncements, and in the smallness of the abolitionist element,
                    the party was characterized by a greater conservatism than elsewhere in the Northwest.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> The outstanding leader of the party in Indiana was Henry S. Lane, nominee for governor
                    in 1860, a Kentuckian by birth, a former Whig, and a great admirer of Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, whose name he declared had been inscribed upon his banner ever since he entered
                    Indiana politics.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> In advocating the non-extension of slavery and at the same
                    time the non-interference with the institution in the States where it existed, Lane represented the
                    view of the rank and file of the party in Indiana.</p>
            <p>The two candidates identified with the more radical wing of the party, Chase and Seward, received
                    little support in the State. George W. Julian favored the former, with the latter as his second
                    choice, but Julian represented only a small minority of the Republican voters of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Furthermore, Seward's antagonism toward the Know-Nothing or American
                    Party weakened him in the State. This element, which had cast more than twenty-two thousands votes
                    for Fillmore in 1856, almost held the balance of power in Indiana. If the Republicans hoped to
                    achieve success in 1860 this group must be won over.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The candidates receiving the most favorable consideration in the State in this pre-convention
                    discussion were Edward Bates of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>

                    pictures of Lincoln and everywhere there were flags "which glimmered in the fitful light of
                    omnibus lamps and the distant radiance of street lights like stripes on a glow worm's

                    Tremont House, directed their efforts at the outset toward winning the Indiana delegates. With no
                    candidate of their own, the Indiana men were in a less embarrassing position than certain other
                    states, like <placeName>

                    defeated. The statements are somewhat conflicting as to when the Hoosiers were definitely won over
                    to Lincoln. Leonard Swett declared shortly after the convention adjourned: "She [Indiana]
                    was about equally divided between Bates and McLean. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were spent upon
                    her, when she came to us unitedly with twenty-six votes, and from that time acted efficiently with
                        us."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Swett was evidently mistaken about the matter. An informal
                    vote taken on Monday, following a full expression of opinion participated in by the delegates and
                    other citizens from Indiana, stood one each for Seward and Chase, four or five for McLean and the

                    today in the city court room, and an informal ballot taken at the close of the last showed that
                    Lincoln had a majority though there is no preference for him that would make them stand out against

                    Koerner obtained the floor as soon as he could, declaring that Bates might secure the German votes

                    Browning followed with an eloquent appeal to Whig sentiment, emphasizing the fact that Lincoln had
                    been a Whig and certainly ought to satisfy those who still adhered to Whig principles in <placeName>

            <p>Apparently, therefore, the Indiana delegates were definitely won over by Thursday evening. In the
                    conferences of that night, Indiana took a leading part. Henry S. Lane was seen at one
                    o'clock, pale and haggard, walking as if for a wager, from one caucus to another at the
                    Tremont house. His plea was that the nomination of Seward would be followed by certain defeat in

            <p>Of more importance than the question of when the Indiana delegates were won for Lincoln is that of
                    how they were won. It has been stated again and again that it was the promise of a Cabinet position
                    to Caleb B. Smith that finally secured their support. Charles Gibson, one of the leading Bates
                    supporters of 1860, said in later years: "We had nearly all Indiana and a large portion of
                    the <placeName>

                    states by agreeing to give Simon Cameron and Caleb B. Smith cabinet positions'. Thurlow
                    Weed controlled Seward's votes absolutely, and had agreed with me that if Seward was not

            </p>
            <p>If this be true, it was a case of the theft of a nomination, a great steal. The thing that won the
                    Indiana delegation, however, was not the offer of a Cabinet position, but rather the cogent
                    arguments of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> leaders that Abraham Lincoln, a former resident of southern Indiana, was the best man
                    for the opposition to unite on, that he, better than any other candidate, would get the southern
                    Whig vote in the State. The Lincoln atmosphere, to which the delegates were constantly subjected in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, doubtless helped. Had the convention been held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which lost it by only one vote, and had Bates possessed as able leaders as Lincoln to
                    look after his interests, it is probable that the Indiana delegates would have been won for Bates,
                    and that the latter would have been the nominee.</p>
            <p>There seems no doubt that Caleb B. Smith was promised a cabinet position. In fact, Judge Davis
                    admitted later that such a pledge was made. Judge William T. Otto, one of the Indiana delegates at
                    large, is authority for the statement that Caleb B. Smith made Judge Davis believe that he must be
                    promised a position in the Cabinet in order to secure the support of the Indiana delegates. Whereas,
                    the facts of the case were, according to Judge Otto, that after looking over the ground at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, they decided to go for Lincoln and cared nothing for Smith obtaining a position in the
                        Cabinet.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The climax of the great drama came on Friday morning. On that memorable day, Indiana played a
                    conspicuous rôle. The nomination of Abraham Lincoln was seconded by Caleb B. Smith in
                    behalf of the Indiana delegates. This was the signal for a demonstration which has few equals in
                    convention history. Henry S. Lane is reported to have leaped upon a table and swaying hat and cane
                    to have performed like an acrobat. When the balloting started, Indiana's twenty-six votes
                    were cast for Lincoln. Only one other state gave him its entire vote on the first ballot. That was <placeName>

                            Davis's own lips. That it was kept, everybody knows, for Caleb B. Smith became the

                    marked effect on the convention. On the second ballot, on the third and on the last, the same
                    twenty-six votes from Indiana were given to Lincoln.</p>
            <p>Addressing the convention shortly after the nomination, Caleb B. Smith drew a picture which doubtless
                    struck a responsive cord in the hearts of all Hoosiers present in the Wigwam that morning.
                    "Thirty years ago," he declared, "on the Southern frontier of Indiana
                    might have been seen a humble, ragged boy, barefooted, driving his oxen through the hills."
                    In explaining the efforts of the Indiana delegates in behalf of this former resident of Indiana, the
                    speaker said: "It is not that we loved Seward less but because we loved the great Re
                    publican cause more. … I assure you that the Republican flag will wave in triumph upon
                    the soil of Indiana."<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lincoln's nomination was the result of a chain of circumstances, no one of which alone could
                    have brought it about. The Lincoln-Douglas debates lifted him into the national vision.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The Cooper Institute address and the <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>

                    </placeName> gave to it a Lincoln background. The yelling and spectacular demonstrations may or may
                    not have helped. The powerful opposition of Horace Greeley, Who, as it was learned later, had
                    written a letter six years before announcing the dissolution of the political firm of Seward, Weed,
                    and Greeley, weakened Seward and created doubts as to his availability.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> The

            <p>It is true that enough votes were transferred to Lincoln after the third ballot to secure the
                    nomination for him without the votes of Indiana. But would this situation have existed had not
                    Indiana lent her aid before the balloting started? It seems reasonable to conclude that if the
                    Indiana delegates had decided to support Bates or some one else that the other doubtful states where
                    Seward was weak, after giving complimentary votes to their own favorite, would have concentrated on

            <p>This view was expressed by many in attendance at the famous convention. Horace Greeley wrote in the

                    Governor Seward was to invoke defeat in their state and in the Union, were most efficient in the
                    canvass, while their early adhesion to Lincoln nearly narrowed the contest to him and

                    Julian's belief that the nomination of Lincoln was secured by a "superficial and

            <p>If any further proof is needed of the enthusiastic response of Indiana Republicans to

                    </placeName> in August. The meeting, according to newspaper accounts of the time, was one of the
                    largest ever held in Indiana. From all the surrounding countryside delegations came in to the
                    capital city to participate in the grand procession. Organizations known as "Wide
                    Awakes," "Rail Maulers," "Lincoln Rangers of Liberty,"
                    and "Old Abe's Boys," streamed in all day long. One thing of unusual
                    interest was a huge wagon filled with "pioneers" actually splitting rails from a
                    log. The wagon was drawn by forty-three yoke of oxen, the entire outfit stretched along the whole
                    front of the capitol square, for a distance of more than four hundred feet.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion, Indiana not only nurtured Lincoln during those formative years in which he grew from

                    Smith the week following his nomination. Well might he have felt grateful to her. Without the aid of
                    Indiana, Lincoln might never have become "The Great Emancipator," "The

            </head>
            <byline>By Robert L. Lafollette</byline>
            <p>A very large part of American history has been the story of the adaptation of immigrants and their
                    descendants to the soil and environment of a newly discovered continent whose possibilities have not
                    yet been fully realized. The mold, a product of nature, which was to fashion and influence that
                    which flowed into it, had long existed in the form of a wide expanse of land. Yet it did not and
                    could not create its contents. As long as the contact of the migrating people with the land was
                    intimate and wellnigh universal, the people took on its qualities—qualities which
                    modified those persons who had recently come, and made out of their children who were at least one
                    step removed from the old home and society something different. As newer generations sprang from
                    their loins, the difference increased with their passing farther and farther away from the older
                    colonies and European influence. As available land has become less plentiful the Americanizing force
                    has diminished partly because the natives are not rejuvenated by—and largely because
                    newcomers can not come in contact with—a frontier environment that has passed in some
                    sections and is in the process of passing in the country.</p>
            <p>There is a vital and close economic relation between land and people. From land with the application
                    of labor come the necessities of life: food, clothing, and shelter. The subsistence of the people is
                    derived from the land. As the number of people increases in proportion to the supply of land the
                    competition for the products of the land becomes more severe. In 1920, fourteen per cent, more crop
                    land was cultivated but by fourteen per cent, fewer farmers than in 1910.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The increase in the use of fertilizer and machinery cannot go on former. The point of diminishing
                    returns will be reached. Moreover our population is increasing at an annual rate of about 1,500,000.

                    permanent way. With the moving out of immigrants to the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, children become less a liability, economic pressure lessens and people do not crack so
                    soon under the strain. Vacancies within the ranks are soon filled. Professor Fairchild has well
                    developed this idea.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is also the social aspect of this problem of immigration. Whenever a more advanced people comes
                    in contact with a less advanced population increment, there is always interaction. The superior
                    tends to be pulled down to the level of the inferior. The degree of the lowering will depend
                    somewhat on the proportion of numbers. The resultant culture is neither as low as the inferior nor
                    as high as the superior. It falls between the two levels. The relation of this truth to the
                    condition where the immigrant increment from southern and southeastern Europe to a section has been
                    large is significant. <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> is such a section. Especially is this true of the southern group of <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> States, <placeName>

                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName>. The foreign element has grown to preponderance. In 1850, the native white element in
                    the combined population of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>, <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>

                    </placeName> constituted 928 out of every 1000 people. In 1920, this element in these three States
                    constituted 612 out of every 1000. In the three lower States of <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName>, the native white element numbered 816 out of every 1000 inhabitants of these states in
                    1850. Seventy years later, there were but 367 persons of the native element in every 1000 people.
                    This native white element is on the way to submergence by sheer failure to maintain its numbers.
                    Will this do more than accentuate a social class division where the native distinctly feels himself
                    superior to the foreigner who in his turn tacitly admits his inferiority? Why use the population
                    numbers of 1890 as the basis for an immigration restrictive measure? Is there justification for the
                    attempt to decrease the immigrant stream from southern and southeastern Europe to the <placeName>

                    settlements as objects for study.</p>
            <p>Let us briefly examine the migration of foreigners to the State of Indiana. It seems a far cry from
                    these present days of restriction to the time when practically every State had its bureau of
                    emigration whose duty it was to encourage foreigners to come as settlers. In January, 1865, Governor
                    Oliver P. Morton of Indiana urged legislation to check the people from passing by or through the
                    State to settle elsewhere.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In November of this same year, we find this State
                    executive advising the sending of a representative to the French Universal Exposition to advertise
                    to Europeans "the great resources, progress, and wealth of the State, the energy,
                    intelligence and refinement of her people, and the superior inducements and advantages presented to
                    immigration." Especially did Indiana appeal to the Germans. They were warned against the
                    South, "a region impoverished, thinned of its population and disorganized by rebellion,
                    where they will find' but few vestiges of German society, where schools have not been
                    encouraged, where labor is without respect and without adequate reward and where the natives of more
                    northern latitudes will contend with the ills of an enervating climate." The advantages of
                    a growing community over either an older or an infant one were pointed out. In Indiana, it was
                    argued, no hardships of a frontier life would have to be experienced. Apparent cheapness of lands in
                    the West might prove illusive. In Indiana there was ready opportunity for work on or near farms
                    already opened. Here was society organized. Attention was called to the possibility of finding a
                    neighborhood of the same nativity or religion, i. e., there would be Prussians near Prussians,
                    Bavarians near Bavarians, and Hanoverians near Hanoverians. Said John A. Wilstach, the Indiana
                    Commissioner of Emigration in 1866: "We need the working man of Europe here to plow to the
                    surface the golden cereal wealth of our primitive prairies. We need him to give work to those latent
                    incorporeal but Titanic forces, those Samsons, which play in our streamlets, bathe in our rivers,
                    and slumber in our beds of coal."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>These efforts had their influence, but the foreign element in Indiana has always been comparatively

                    in 1900, Indiana had but 142,121 or a little more than three per cent, of the total. With the
                    exception of the period from 1850 to 1870, Indiana's foreign-born population has increased
                    very slowly. From 1870 to 1890, there was an absolute increase of only 4,731 in the foreign-born
                    population of the State. A decrease the decade between 1890 and 1900, made the increase in the
                    number of foreign-born in Indiana in 1900 over the number within the state in 1870, only 647. In
                    1900, 1910 and 1920, the foreign-born element made HP less than six per cent, of the total
                    population of Indiana. It is the least foreign of all the States of the old Northwest.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In 1910, the foreign-born population was distributed by birth among the principal

                    that the northern and northwestern Europeans preponderated. They have always done so in the State of
                    Indiana. With this background, we will now consider the political, social, and economic influences
                    of the Germans as representative of the northern and northwestern Europeans, and then follow this
                    with a study of the Poles as representative of the eastern Europeans. <placeName>

                    they are an economic asset. The effect of homeowning on citizenship has been well demonstrated.</p>
            <p>In religion, the Germans are active as church members. They are loyal to the church which not only
                    ministers to their religious needs, but serves as a medium for social intercourse. Their ministers
                    are very highly respected.</p>
            <p>They have their parochial schools but only the German Catholics are insistent upon State support for
                    them. As in their home country, illiteracy is practically non-existent among them. The children
                    often become grade and high school teachers and parents serve on the school board. There is little
                    objection to the payment of the school taxes. There is no social ban against the Germans. The
                    younger generation takes up the amusements of the natives of the same age-period. They enrich the
                    musical life of the communities in which they live.</p>
            <p>In politics there is no marked German solidarity in these communities. Respect for the law and
                    authority is bred in the bone. In summary, the Germans in these communities are intelligent,
                    industrious, and economical. They become naturalized and are relatively easily assimilated.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, was founded in 1861 by three Polish families. They began as laborers,
                    clearing the land, ditching and doing general farm work. In two or three years land was purchased.
                    Other families came and the community began to look upon these Poles as a source of labor for
                    clearing, wood splitting, and ditching. The wood was easily sold as the railroads used wood for
                    fuel. In 1872, there was founded a Polish Roman Catholic church and the church records show sixty
                    families at that time. This really determined that the settlement would be permanent as the church
                    gave a center of community and race interest. They would now stay as an agreeable social life was
                    assured—and among their own people. The lands which they purchased were usually the less
                    fertile or the depleted. That they are cautious is shown <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The first houses of the Poles<hi rend="sup">9</hi> were hardly sufficient for shelter. The wife and
                    children helped with the crops. It was not unusual to see a woman chopping wood or helping to cut
                    tree trunks into logs. These huts have given away to houses of five to eight or even ten rooms.
                    Although the families are ordinarily large,<hi rend="sup">10</hi> this improvement is not wholly due
                    to this. In many instances there is a parlor in addition to the living room. Most Polish women give
                    little attention to cooking. Meats and potatoes are consumed in large quantities. Among the more
                    prosperous families, the field work of the women and girls has been lessened somewhat, but the
                    poorer have not changed much in this respect.</p>
            <p>The majority of the Poles own their own farms and have very good bank accounts. Out of thirty farms
                    investigated there were only four which showed indebtedness. The total amount of indebtedness
                    reported was $4,775. This is probably below the true figure but it is indicative of the
                        situation.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Social life centers chiefly about the church. Picnics and suppers are held there. Since practically
                    every family attends church, social intercourse is obtained in that way. Much is made of weddings
                    and christenings. They are largely attended and a spirit of jollity pervades such affairs.
                    Receptions and dancing follow these events. There is some association with the natives at public
                    gatherings but very little at purely social functions. Indeed, it is so infrequent as to be
                    negligible. The Poles are all Catholics, while almost all the natives are Protestants so the church
                    meetings of the two are separate. The church does not bring them together. The relations between the
                    natives and the Poles are business relations. The Poles are honest and have gained the respect of
                    business men. There are parochial schools for children through the first eight grades, where
                    "all subjects are taught in English except Polish history and the Polish
                        language."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The interest in public school education is on the

            <p>Nearly all the Poles are voters under the laws of Indiana. They have held such minor offices as tax
                    assessor, road supervisor, and school commissioner, but the one candidate who has ever run for
                    county office was defeated by a few votes. The majority take some newspaper printed in English and
                    more than one printed in Polish. Most of the latter are printed in this country.</p>
            <p>In summary, it may be said that the Poles have increased the wealth of the communities in which they
                    are located. They have cleared, drained, and improved poor land which would not have become
                    productive so soon had it not been for their work. Their example has stimulated better farming and
                    care of the soil. This all has to do with economic conditions. Socially they are a misfit. Their
                    fellow immigrants from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> consider them inferior. They constitute a little <placeName>

            <p>It is quite clear that the Germans are much more easily assimilated than the Poles. The Poles do not
                    even mix well and certainly are not fused with the native element through marriages nor by mingling
                    in the life of the larger community. Says W. S. Rossiter of the British and Germans: "They
                    may be classed merely as belated arrivals of the original settler stock who were speedily and
                    completely assimilated."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The Poles differing from these in instincts,
                    tendencies, history, and traditions, as they do from the natives, have many characteristics to
                    prevent assimilation.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of amalgamation has been greatly increased with the increase in the number of Roman
                    Catholics among the immigrants. Religion is an inward business deeply rooted through inheritance of
                    long standing. Age-old religious adherence is not easily undermined. The <placeName>

                        of the foreign-born population or at least the foreign element was in Indiana by that time. This
                        would be especially true for the Germans, of course.</item>

            <p>The Protestant Reformation had a rather uneven effect on Europe, but its most permanent and greatest
                    influence was in the northern and northwestern portions of the continent and in Great Britain.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Of the German states listed above, the first ten are predominantly
                    Protestant. In the last two, Roman Catholics preponderate.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Great Britain, <placeName>

                    </placeName> are mostly Protestant.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Thus it is clear that foreigners coming to
                    Indiana have been adherents of Protestantism for the most part. This is the explanation of the small
                    number of Roman Catholics in the State.</p>
            <p>A study of Roman Catholics in Indiana with the aid of maps reveals that, where we find Roman
                    Catholics, we find counties in which foreigners predominate. The converse does not hold true in many
                    instances. We do not find the counties with large foreign elements and manufacturing counties
                    corresponding in many cases. This gives further evidence to indicate that Indiana's
                    foreigners are largely farmers. The counties shown as manufacturing are by no means exclusively, and
                    in some cases not predominantly so, but a glance at the grain production and farm land value maps
                    will suffice to show that this is true.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, another interesting thing about the Roman Catholic population in Indiana is the apparent
                    influence of the metropolitan centers of sister states. A metropolis is not only a distributing
                    center of economic goods but often of a peculiar culture as well. Moreover, it overflows on the
                    surrounding territory, fills up suburban areas, and overflows again. A study of foreign and Roman
                    Catholic population density maps conveys this truth. In the case of Indiana, her northwestern corner
                    is a part of Greater <placeName>

            <p>Immigration is not such a justifiable cause for concern on account of the increasing proportion of

                    complained that the new immigrants are more illiterate, unskilled, less likely to become
                    naturalized, have a lower standard of living and therefore do not become an integral part of our
                    economic and political life.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Says a noted authority on immigration:
                    "These people have no history behind them which is of a nature to give encouragement. They
                    have none of the inherited instincts and tendencies which make it comparatively easy to deal with
                    the immigration of the earlier time. They are beaten men from beaten races, representing the worst
                    failures in the struggle for existence. Centuries are against them as centuries were on the side of
                    those who formerly came to us."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> At best, the cake of custom is only
                    softened or cracked and the influence that seeps in is small. There is danger in this, that the
                    fecundity of the low standard immigrant women results in the delivering of a "full
                    quiver" of their kind to cramp the natives of higher standards.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In comparison with other States of the Middle West, Indiana has been fairly free from this
                    deleterious influence of the "new immigrants." The State has almost

            <head>Hananiah Lincoln in Revolutionary and Pioneer History</head>
            <byline>By Louis A. Warren</byline>
            <p>Hananiah Lincoln has been the despair of genealogists who have tried to decide just where he belongs
                    in the Lincoln family tree. Two rôles have been assigned him, just recently, which call
                    for some documentary study of his activities. A group of his descendents who live close to the <placeName>

                    </placeName>-<placeName>

                    </placeName> border line are under the impression that Hananiah Lincoln was the grandfather of the
                    President and that he should receive the honor and recognition which has been given to another.
                    Contrariwise to this patronizing theory an argument has been set forth in a recent magazine article
                    which would make Hananiah Lincoln largely responsible for depleting the funds in the treasury of the
                    pioneer Abraham Lincoln. The straitened circumstances of the widow, Bersheba Lincoln, and her five
                    orphan children are charged to Hananiah who is said to have borrowed all the surplus cash from her
                    husband and failed to repay him.</p>
            <p>The documents bearing upon this very interesting character do not support either one of these
                    theories, but show Hananiah's genial relationship to both the grandfather and father of
                    Abraham Lincoln, the President. Aside from the controversial features which invite this discussion,
                    Hananiah Lincoln's service in the Revolutionary War is of interest to his many descendents
                    who are now living in the state of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Much of the confusion about Lincoln history would be avoided if the contents of Abraham
                    Lincoln's correspondence and autobiographical sketches were more fully known. A letter to
                    one of his relatives states that he remembered, "a long time ago seeing Austin and Davis
                    Lincoln, said to be sons of Hanaiel or Hannanial Lincoln who was said to have been a cousin of my
                        grandfather."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The relationship of Hananiah to the
                    President's grandfather Abraham is stated correctly, although there seems to have been some
                    difficulty in spelling the name. I have come upon these different spellings: Hannanighah, Hannaiel,
                    Hannanial, Hanniniah, Hannia, Anniah, Niah, and some others which could not be accurately

                    encouragement of the settling of the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName>." This is the same Robert Baird for which Bairdstown, now called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bardstown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was named."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>Hananiah moved to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and bought from a man by the name of Welsh, "a lot sowed in grass adjoining
                    the one acre where he now lives." The purchase of this land from Welsh involved Lincoln in
                    litigation, with Welsh as the defendant. Not only did these men seek recourse in the courts but the
                    wife of Lincoln, the wife of Welsh, and Mrs. Hettie Inlow and her daughters Polly and Elinor, were
                    involved. The trouble over the disappearance of a piece of callico belonging to Mrs. Lincoln was the
                    cause of the disturbance. It appears that Mrs. Lincoln was having some sewing done and alleged that
                    some goods had been stolen. The court records do not show what disposition was made of the case, but
                    the fact that Lincoln later sued Welsh and wife for slander implies that some hard words had been
                    used about the missing callico.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    had evidently disposed of most of his land as he named only one tract. A very interesting

                    Thomas was tied down to this piece of land and not at liberty to spend some time in the communities
                    where he had formerly lived. On August 16, 1801, his name appears on the marriage certificate of a

                    another person.</p>
            <p>The association of Thomas Lincoln, father of President Lincoln, with Hananiah Lincoln has caused some
                    confusion as to the relationship of these two men. Many of the descendants of Hananiah now believe
                    him to have been the grandfather of the President. This confusion is accentuated by the fact that
                    Hananiah did have a son Thomas, but this Thomas was not the father of Abraham Lincoln. The citizens
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Cumberland County</region>
                    </placeName> have recently put forth a claim that Abraham Lincoln was born there. No one who is
                    familiar with the history of Thomas Lincoln in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hardin County</region>
                    </placeName>, from the time he was married in 1806 until he left for Indiana in 1816, will give this
                    claim very serious consideration.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The testimony of the President himself is
                    sufficient to quiet all these idle notions, as he not only states the place of his birth but also
                    gives the name of his grandfather.</p>
            <p>The Thomas Lincoln who entered 200 acres of land in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Cumberland County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1815, was very likely the son of Hananiah, who was about twenty-five years old at
                    that time. He would have been too young, however, to serve as a constable as early as 1802. The fact
                    that there were two Thomas Lincolns in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Cumberland County</region>
                    </placeName> for a period has added to the confusion. Another consideration which has helped to
                    nourish the tradition that Hananiah Lincoln was the grandfather of the President is the close
                    association of Thomas, the President's father, and the children of Hananiah, in the Indiana
                    country.</p>

            <p>We learn from the Cumberland. County records that on February 14, 1801, Hananiah Lincoln married Lucy
                    Wilson. There is no tradition among the descendants of Hananiah that he was married a second time,
                    but there seems to have been no other Hananiah of a marriageable age at this time. Hananiah was then
                    forty-five years old and the marriage of a widower of that age would have been reasonable to expect.
                    In fact we know very little about Hananiah Lincoln after this date. Serving as sheriff of <placeName>

            <p>Just how many children Hananiah and Sarah Jeffries Lincoln had is not known. We have positive
                    evidence of six and probably there were others. The old family Bible of Moses Lincoln has been
                    preserved. An inscription therein proves him to have been the first-born child of Hananiah and
                    Sarah. He was born December 22, 1787 and named for his Grandfather Jeffries. Thomas, Austin and
                    Davis, were other sons, probably born in this order. There were two daughters, Sarah and Lucy. The
                    last named was born April 27,1799. The fact that Hananiah married Lucy Wilson about two years later
                    would suggest that Hananiah's first wife died shortly after the birth of this child, who
                    was possibly named for the woman, a friend of the family, who became the second wife of Hananiah
                    later.</p>
            <p>It will be convenient to present these six children in three groups of two each. The two eldest sons,
                    Moses and Thomas, about the year 1816, went north to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    of Jesse Gee who had been a bondsman for Thomas Lincoln, father of the President, in the year 1802.
                    The fact that Thomas, the son of Hananiah, named one of his children Jesse G. Lincoln supports the
                    statement. Moses did not choose a wife until he reached <placeName>

                    26 and 45 and his wife is listed as over 18 and under 26. They had two sons and a daughter at this
                    time, all three under ten years of age.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> I have been unable to learn the names
                    of either of his two sons. A Levisy Lincoln married a James Hargrave on June 21, 1828. This wedding

            <p>It was not until sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 1816 that President
                    Lincoln's father and his family moved into Indiana. They located not more than twelve miles

                    the coming of Thomas to Indiana and for his choice of the particular tract of land which he
                    occupied. It is not likely that Davis Lincoln reached the Indiana country until late in the year
                    1820, as his name does not appear on the 1820 census. He entered a tract of land, however, as early
                    as April, 1821.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> His sister Sarah came with him, and I am also of the opinion

            <p>Armarintha was in love with a young man by the name of Wilson. His attentions were not looked upon
                    with pleasure by Austin Lincoln, the brother with whom the girl was then living. Wilson continued to
                    keep company with her, however. One day he visited the Lincoln Mill with the intention of making a
                    further appeal for the hand of Armarintha, to whom he had become engaged, when a fierce struggle
                    occurred between Austin Lincoln and his sister's suitor. That evening the dead body of
                    Austin Lincoln was found on the stairs leading to the second story of the mill. Wilson fled the
                    country taking a boat down the <placeName>

                    she met Wilson and that they were married. Of one fact we are certain that on December 5, 1840,
                    Armarintha was still single as she was a party to a sale of some land in <placeName>

            <p>It is to be hoped that some member of the Hananiah Lincoln family will become interested in following
                    the descendants of this revolutionary soldier beyond the point where it has been found necessary to
                    conclude this narrative. A complete genealogy of this family would make a valuable addition to

            <p>Clark's own accounts of his campaigns are as follows: While at <placeName>

                    highly prized. This was sent off November 19, 1779, and as a contemporary account by the actor in
                    the events is a source of importance.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Ten years later Clark was importuned by

                    began to collect letters and documents for this purpose. At this time he tried to recover the letter
                    to Mason but without success. He did, however, find and copy many of the original letters and
                    diaries of the campaign, and made every effort to have this account accurate. It begins with the

                    history contains the first printed reference to Clark's campaigns. Marshall called him
                    "a great commander".<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Since General Clark was still living in
                    dependence and obscurity and since he and his family belonged to a different political party from
                    Marshall, this was a notable tribute. One other history published during Clark's lifetime
                    contains a brief account of his conquests. That was the continuation of Burk's <hi rend="i">History of <placeName>

                    contact with Draper. In 1852, however, Lossing began a serial publication of a pictorial history of
                    the Revolution, which was issued in 1855 in two volumes as the <hi rend="i">Pictorial Field Book of
                        the Revolution.</hi> Lossing, who began his career as an engraver, had visited in person most of
                    the places he described in this work. In volume two he included a considerable account of Clark and
                    the region where his conquests were made. After this Clark's name began to appear in
                    magazine articles and in general works. <hi rend="i">Harper's Magazine</hi>, in 1860-61,

            <p>A century had passed since Clark had joined Lord Dunmore on his expedition which was to open the West
                    to settlement and give a temporary relief from Indian depredations. Clark had now taken his place
                    among the generals of the Revolution; he was recognized as having been chief actor on the western
                    scene. He had been called "The Hannibal of the West," the "Western <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>," inappropriate but flattering appelations. It remained to make him better
                    known to the world of readers of general history. This was accomplished in some degree by Theodore
                    Roosevelt in his <hi rend="i">Winning of the West</hi>, the first two volumes of which appeared in
                    1889. It was unfortunate that Roosevelt did not discover the Draper Manuscript collection (then in
                    Draper's private library) while writing his earlier volumes. Before he brought out volumes
                    three and four he had visited <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>, and, in a stay of several weeks, had
                    familiarized himself with a part of its contents. Because of this lack of knowledge and his own
                    temper-mental reactions, Roosevelt "alternately praises and belittles Clark."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> He knew the "Memoir" only in Dillon's reproduction
                    and pronounced it the work of a useless old man. At one moment he called Clark "the
                    greatest of the first generation of Trans-Allegheny pióneers," then spoke of his
                    conquests as of little importance.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Nevertheless his work had a wide reading
                    and made Clark's name known to a generation of history readers in the late nineteenth
                    century. About the same time, there appeared the article on "The West in the
                    Revolution," by W. F. Poole in Justin Winsor, <hi rend="i">Narrative and Critical History
                        of America.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">22</hi> This carried an extended account both of Clark and his
                    conquests. The popularity of Clark at this period is evidenced by the appearance of a portion of his
                    "Memoir" in the Old South Leaflets.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> John Fiske in his <hi rend="i">American Revolution</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">24</hi> said: "The military enterprise
                    of Clark was crowned by the diplomacy of Jay."</p>
            <p>Two Indiana historians about this period added largely to Clark's fame. Jacob Piatt Dunn,
                    secretary of the Indiana Historical Society in 1886, and state librarian, 1889-93, was invited to
                    write the history of his state for the American Common- <list type="footnotes">

                    that Clark has at last obtained not only historical but popular recognition for his share in making
                    the Old Northwest a part of the American nation.</p>

            </head>
            <byline>By Stanley Coulter</byline>
            <p>In the recent passing of Dr. Thomas Francis Moran, education and scholarship suffered an almost
                    irreparable loss. A profound scholar, a clear thinker, an inspiring teacher, he achieved eminence in
                    these fields, while as a leader in civic and philanthropic movements he represented the highest type
                    of citizenship.</p>
            <p>This article is an attempt to reveal, in some measure at least, the personality of this rare man,
                    something of the charm and strength that made him <hi rend="i">facile princeps</hi> in every field
                    he entered.</p>
            <p>A few facts, however, are needed to serve as a background for this appreciation. Born at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName>, January 9, 1866, Mr. Moran received his bachelor's
                    degree from the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> in 1887, and that of Doctor of Philosophy from Johns Hopkins University in 1895. In
                    1887, he became Superintendent of Schools at Elk River, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, where he remained until 1892. Then he entered upon his candidacy for the doctorate. In
                    1895, he accepted the position of Professor of History and Head of the Department of History and
                    Economics at Purdue University, remaining in that position until his sudden and untimely death in
                    1928.</p>
            <p>My associations with Dr. Moran were those of a colleague in the University faculty and were intimate
                    from the day of his appearance upon the campus. We both spoke the same language and had much the
                    same educational ideals. Because of this affectionate intimacy, continuing uninterruptedly for more
                    than three decades, I feel a certain restraint in attempting to characterize this radiant and
                    dynamic personality. I leave to historians the evaluation of his work, only attempting here to
                    interpret the man.</p>
            <p>The first impression made upon any one meeting Dr. Moran would be that here was a man of exceptional
                    physical and intellectual alertness and vigor. His every movement and utterance confirmed this
                    impression and gave to him an immediate prominence in any assemblage. Added to this, there seemed to
                    radiate from him an atmosphere of cheerfulness, of a joyous, <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-025-1-054"/>
                    even jocund, outlook upon life, a confidence in himself and in the future.</p>
            <p>But would these qualities retain their fineness in the dull routine of the class room, for after all
                    it was in the class room that he was to justify himself. Those of us who were older in the service
                    eagerly watched this ardent young man as with an almost debonair courage he entered upon his life
                    work. From his very first appearance before a class, he held the confidence and the constantly
                    growing affection of all who came under his teaching. He was something different from the student
                    conception of a professor. He was so friendly, so full of humor, so versatile, so entirely and
                    charmingly human, that he drew them to himself irresistibly.</p>
            <p>In his teaching he was clear, his statements were terse and incisive, his questions searching and
                    comprehensive. Although he possessed the charm that attracted, he was a close and exacting teacher,
                    demanding honest work and giving his scholarship ratings because of actual achievement and not
                    because of endeavor. No student ever selected a course under Dr. Moran as a "snap
                    course." He daily demonstrated that it was possible to make his courses fascinatingly
                    interesting, and yet rigidly to exact a complete fulfillment of the requirements.</p>
            <p>His lectures and class room instruction were enriched and illuminated by his versatility, his
                    constant habit of drawing illustrative material from widely variant sources. His memory was
                    marvelous, and fact and source, exact quotation and reference abounded in every lecture. At times a
                    student would doubt whether such versatility and exactness could be combined in one mind and would
                    check back references and allusions only to find that this great teacher was as exact as he was
                    versatile.</p>
            <p>Thus a course in history which promised to be a dry record of some past age or civilization became a
                    vibrantly living thing; a cross section of the life and art and literature and government of a past
                    age it is true, and yet vitally and intimately connected with the present. His was the high art of
                    breathing upon the dry bones of history and restoring them to life.</p>
            <p>In speech he was eloquent and compellingly magnetic, and, whether he lectured or taught, there were
                    always those flashes of wit and humor that made his as popular upon the public platform as in the
                    class room.</p>
            <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-025-1-055"/>
            <p>Dr. Moran was one of the greatest teachers I ever knew. He was not merely a drill sergeant in the
                    technique of facts and dates, but a teacher who in an exceptional way stirred his pupils to creative
                    thought and through this to higher ideals of life. His was the power of teaching in such a way as to
                    develop character. Possibly this was due, in part, to the fact that in Dr. Moran the pedagogue never
                    hid the man.</p>
            <p>His influence upon student life was not confined to his class room and <hi rend="i">seminar.</hi>
                    There was no phase of student activity which did not profoundly interest him. So he studied the
                    extra-curricular activities, and, while sympathetic to all, to some few he devoted both time and
                    thought. A notable instance of this is found in his years as chairman of the Faculty Committee on
                    Athletics, and his equal number of years of membership in the Big Ten Conference as the
                    representative of Purdue University. There is no need to speak of his work, nor yet of his
                    commanding influence in intercollegiate athletics, for both are a part of the history of athletics
                    in the universities of the central-west. Clear headed, finely poised, unswervingly adhering to the
                    rules as laid down by the conference, sternly just in the infliction of penalties in cases of their
                    infraction, he taught almost as effectively as chairman of the athletic committee as in his class
                    room in history. Here he taught, honor, truth, fair play, clean sportsmanship, and the friendliness
                    of honest competition. Other students than those of Purdue University have profited by his teaching
                    in this field.</p>
            <p>It mattered little what university duty might be assigned him it was done promptly, efficiently,
                    brilliantly. Naturally this vitality and effectiveness could not find full scope within the
                    university walls, and so he became a "Community Servant." The demands of community
                    and State are both numerous and varied, and it is amazing to find to how many of these Dr. Moran
                    responded with loyal service and superb effectiveness. He was a member of the American Historical
                    Association; of the American Political Science Association; of the Indiana Historical Commission
                    (1921-25); of the Education Committee the National Security League; Associate Director of the
                    Speaking Division of the Commission on Public Information during the World War. He also lectured at
                    other Universities; at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> in 1914; and at Lafay- <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-025-1-056"/> ette College in 1915, as
                    Fred Morgan Kirby Lecturer on Civil Rights. These are but a few of his widely ranging activities.</p>
            <p>His contributions to his own community were manifold and varied. I think Dr. Moran would have given
                    first place to his service as Senior Warden and Lay Reader of St. John's Episcopal church,
                    for he was deeply and devoutly religious. He was President of the Art Association; member and past
                    President of the Rotary, Town and Gown, and Parlor Clubs; a member of both the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">West Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> Country Clubs, and, strangely enough for a College professor, President of a Bank. A
                    full life he lived, yet with time enough to write many books, to give countless addresses, and to
                    enjoy as few do his own home.</p>
            <p>This summary is given largely to explain, in part, the reason he was a great teacher. These
                    multiplied contacts with movements and people enriched his life. They broadened and deepened his
                    mind, which with its keen insights, its fair judgments, its clarities of thought, was reflected in
                    his every contact with students. Toward the close of his teaching years, he took charge of a
                    freshman course in history, as a part of an orientation program. The class was held in the building
                    which I then controlled. After a lecture, the four hundred freshmen would stream past my office
                    door, all talking, and always talking of the interest and helpfulness of the course. Few heads of
                    departments would have undertaken such a course, but Dr. Moran did and carried it supremely well.
                    His orientation lectures in history were the most brilliantly effective teaching I ever witnessed.</p>
            <p>Dr. J. A. Estey, his associate, says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Dr. Moran gave his time and energies without stint to every public spirited movement. He was
                            one of those men upon whom the whole community implicitly relies when public affairs of note
                            have to be carried on. A man of sincere religious beliefs, a devout and loyal member of his
                            church, cultured, discriminative in his tastes and scholarly in his judgments, Dr. Moran
                            represented the highest type of American citizenship. His influence upon generations of
                            students cannot be measured in mere class room instruction, for to his mastery of his
                            subject he also brought a personal enthusiasm, an engaging sense of humor and an ability to
                            stimulate the intellectual energies of his hearers, that raised his classes to a level best
                            appreciated, perhaps, in later years when the student out in the world begins to assess the
                            value of his college education.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Dr. Moran was a great teacher because he was a big man, one who saw life clearly and saw it whole. He
                    looked out upon <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-025-1-057"/> it cheerfully, courageously, hopefully. To him
                    it offered opportunity for service and this service he rendered unstintedly to the very end.</p>
            <p>He passed away, as I believe he would have chosen to do, in the full richness of his powers, eager,
                    expectant, joyous, ready for the higher services to which he was summoned.</p>

            <p>This account of the connection of Robert Dale Owen with the Common School Fund of Indiana was written
                    by himself. He was not one to magnify his efforts in any direction, and his account, which I had the
                    privilege of securing some years ago, was, doubtless, not intended for publication. It was written
                    to refresh his recollection about a matter in which he was intensely interested, and I think it of
                    such worth as to be made a matter of record.</p>

            <p>In 1836, Robert Dale Owen was a Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives of the Indiana
                    Legislature. He was opposed by two other candidates: James R. E. Goodlet and Kenner Cralle. The vote
                    at the polls stood—Owen, 775; Goodlet, 250; Cralle, 201. Mr. Owen's majority was
                    more than twice as large as any ever given to a candidate for the position in <placeName>

            <p>At the session of the Legislature of 1836-1837, a number of measures of importance came up for
                    consideration. Among the most important was the application of the "Surplus
                    Revenue," coming to Indiana from the <placeName>

            <p>The discussions regarding the distribution or application of the Surplus Revenue coming to Indiana
                    (Say about $1,100,000; it was at first expected it would be $1,500,000) were
                    long and animated.</p>
            <p>The principal point of discussion, at first, was whether a portion of this fund should be employed in
                    the support of Common Schools, or devoted to aid in carrying out the Internal Improvement System of
                    the State.</p>
            <p rend="center">REMARKS OF MR. OWEN.</p>
            <p>On motion to apply a portion of the proceeds of the surplus revenue to the support of the Common
                    Schools, Mr. Owen said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I much regret, sir, that this, like so many other questions before us, has been made a party
                            question; one which it is thought necessary to rally those who call themselves the internal
                            improvement party, against those whom they are pleased to designate as the enemies of
                            improvements.</p>
                        <p>I still more regret, sir, the tone and spirit which some gentlemen have permitted themselves
                            on this subject. How stands the case, sir? Each man knows his own peculiar position best.
                            Permit me to refer to mine. My constituents, assembled in public meeting, but a short time
                            before I left home, instructed myself and their senator, in the strongest terms, to use our
                            exertions in this matter in favor of education. In accordance, as well with their express
                            instructions as with my own deep and abiding conviction, I advocate the application of a
                            fund coming to us, as it were by unexpected good fortune, to that object which of all others
                            is nearest to my heart and which I hold to be most intimately connected with the prosperity
                            and morality of our State. And how, sir, is such an expression of opinion met? By charges of
                            intention to disorganize. By accusations of a design to ruin the credit and subvert the
                            internal improvement system of the state. We are charged with seeking to effect these unholy
                            ends, first, by an attempt to add to the system such a supplement as would, by its weight,
                            destroy it; and when this plot failed, by asking for education, that which a regard for the
                            interest of Indiana imperatively demands for rail roads and canals. Arguments thus illiberal
                            and gratuitous produce no impression and merit no reply. From me, at least, they shall have
                            none.</p>
                        <p>But, sir, there are others better worth replying to. My friend from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                            </placeName> [George H. Proffitt] says he is sorry that, at last, he is obliged to leave us.
                            So am I, sir, that he has thought it necessary to leave us, in so good a cause. He tells us
                            did I hear him right, sir? that "he will not exactly say that education is
                            unnecessary." I cannot believe that he spoke <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-025-1-060"/>
                            otherwise than in jest. He "will not say that it is unnecessary"! Is this
                            the cold, the indifferent tone that is to be employed in regard to a subject, the most
                            important that ever occupied a legislature's time or a nation's thoughts?
                            Not <hi rend="i">unnecessary</hi>! I would that I could express to you, sir, as I feel it,
                            the extent of good or of evil that hangs on our decision. It may be unpopular,
                            sir,—it may be thought visionary in this house—but it is my most
                            honest conviction—that every subject that has come, that can come before
                            us—our great plan of internal improvement itself—is of small
                            importance compared with the wise training of those who, in the next generation, are to make
                            this world a happy or a miserable one. And are not the facts around us—are not
                            our own latent convictions, evidence all sufficient of the truth of my opinion? Do we not
                            feel—the dullest among us—that we are not in temper, in habits, in
                            feeling, in intelligence, what we might have been? That our nature was better than our
                            education? Do we not feel, even in our most careless moments, that there are springs of
                            virtue within us that have seldom been touched—generous aspirings that have
                            hardly been called into action? If we might re-educate ourselves from the cradle upwards,
                            checking the rising vice and cultivating the nascent virtue, bending the pliant habit to
                            reason and mastering the evil passion at its birth, how gladly would we grasp at the offer!
                            how dearly value the privilege! And what selfishness would do for itself, shall not parental
                            affection do for its offspring? shall not Indiana do for its citizens?</p>
                        <p>But, sir, independently of the intrinsic importance of an appropriation for education, what
                            says our Constitution on the subject? Permit me to read to you, sir, Section 2 of Article 9
                            of that document.</p>
                        <p>"It shall be the duty of the General Assembly, as soon as circumstances permit, to
                            provide by law for a general system of education, ascending, in a regular gradation, from
                            township schools to a state university, wherein tuition shall be gratis and equally open to
                            all".</p>
                        <p>Is that, sir, a part of our Constitution, or is it not? If it be, what shall we say to the
                            argument of the gentleman [Mr. Joseph G. Marshall, later candidate of the Whig party for
                            Governor] from Jefferson [county]. "It would be an act of
                            folly"—these, I think, sir, were his words, as I took them
                            down—"It would be an act of folly to give a portion of the surplus
                            revenue to education. OF FOLLY!"</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Marshall explained that he intended merely to express the opinion that, at present, it would be
                    imprudent to expend any portion of the revenue for other purposes than internal improvements.</p>
            <p>Mr. Owen resumed: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Well, sir, the gentleman's opinion is, then, that it behooves us to give internal
                            improvement the complete precedence of education. I deny not, sir, that his opinion is
                            entitled to as much weight as that of any other member on this floor. But, sir, shall it
                            weigh against the opinions—the enactments — of those who framed our
                            Constitution? Shall it weigh against the Constitution itself? Or are we prepared to suffer
                            the very spirit of that Constitution to be violated—its express opinions to be
                            con- <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-025-1-061"/> demned—its nobly expressed intentions to
                            be postponed, neglected, set aside? If we are, sir, better far better summon a Convention at
                            once, and strike out the valueless, because powerless, provision. I had rather, sir, see
                            that clause of our Constitution—dearly as I prize—struck out tomorrow
                            than to see it stand there a mere dead letter—a worthless matter of neglected
                            form.</p>
                        <p>"As soon as circumstances permit" These are the constitution's
                            words, sir. What do they mean? How are they understood by those who refuse a portion of this
                            fund to education, not only in the present time, but even in the distant future not only
                            now, but ten years hence? Is it come to this sir? In 1816 our constitution declared that a
                            provision should be made for education as soon as circumstances permit; such a provision,
                            observe you, as would require many hundreds of thousands of dollars to carry it out. Twenty
                            years elapse; and circumstances "do not yet permit" We are busy about
                            something else, and cannot attend to that matter just at present. Is this, even, all? Oh no,
                            sir, far from it. Not only do circumstances not yet permit; but we are willing, even
                            beforehand, to decide, that, ten years hence, circumstances will not, even then, permit us
                            to depart from our present policy. How should we regard a parent who, in view of his present
                            straitened condition as to pecuniary resources, should declare, not only, that for the
                            present he could spare nothing to educate his children, but that even hereafter he could
                            make no such provision? And would not such opinions as those I have alluded to cause Indiana
                            to act towards her young citizens the part of just such a parent?</p>
                        <p>What amount of the fund will probably be required to carry out the constitutional provision
                            in question? Is it a small matter, sir, such as the petty appropriations heretofore made
                            towards that object may suffice for. Let us calculate. There are upwards of one hundred
                            thousand children in Indiana, between the ages of four and sixteen; probably one hundred and
                            twenty thousand. They can not be educated in common day schools, as every farmer's
                            child ought to be, for ten dollars each a year. No teacher can do justice to more than from
                            20 to 30 pupils; and no well qualified teacher should be required—ought to be
                            required—to devote his time and talents to this arduous and important duty for an
                            amount of remuneration less than that obtained by a master carpenter or bricklayer, say
                            $500 or $600 a year. When they are so required, the result is that the
                            situation is inefficiently filled, its respectability destroyed and its sacred duties
                            slighted.</p>
                        <p>But suppose, sir, that ten dollars a year from each scholar were a sufficient compensation;
                            and that our state contains but 100,000 children. <hi rend="i">One Million</hi>, then, is
                            the amount required annually for education. How contemptible a fraction of that sum has,
                            hitherto, been so appropriated!</p>
                        <p>What shall I say to the spirit in which my friend from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                            </placeName> tells us that if we are not willing to concede the whole for internal
                            improvement, he for one, is in favor of the majority stepping up, without further phrase or
                            ceremony <hi rend="i">and taking it.</hi> His principles thus nakedly expressed, seem to me
                            to savor <hi rend="i">not</hi> a little of that feudal axiom which some rhymster has,
                            happily enough, condensed into the couplet, "The good old rule <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-025-1-062"/> sufficed them, the simple plan, that he should take who has the
                            power, and he should keep who can".</p>
                        <p>Yet, sir, I do not complain that the majority, when they have the power, should freely use
                            it. I but say that if this surplus revenue is finally disposed of without reserving out of
                            it some provision for common schools, it will be, so far as my instrumentality is concerned,
                            for one reason only; and that is because I can not help it.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>After much discussion the vote was taken on the application, first of a half, then of a third, then
                    of a fourth, for Common School purposes; and they beat us on each vote, nearly two to one. Upon
                    this, the friends of education lost heart and considered the matter as settled against them.</p>
            <p>Such, however, was not my view of the matter. I saw that though the Internal Improvement party had
                    beaten us, they could not agree among themselves. One party, and a pretty strong one, wished to have
                    the amount of Surplus Revenue coming to the State expended in the creation of Bank Stock. The other
                    party, nearly of equal strength, wished to have it loaned out in each county by an Agent, specially
                    appointed for that purpose, in small sums. These respective parties brought forth their favorite
                    propositions, both agreeing only in this, that the proceeds were to go entirely to Internal
                    Improvement. Our education party had, therefore, a chance of defeating both, if we used it. We first
                    aided the Bank party to defeat the County men, and then joined the latter and threw out the
                    propositions of the former.</p>
            <p>Thus every party in the House was successively defeated; and the members began to see that some
                    compromise only could enable any party to carry its bill through.</p>
            <p>In this state of matters, Mr. Vandaver [Joel Vandeveer] of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName>, about a fortnight before the time fixed for the conclusion of the Session, to-wit, on
                    the Friday fortnight before adjournment, after a morning session spent in unavailing discussion,
                    asked me which of the parties I favored, the Bank or the County party. "I
                    observe," said he, "that you and your friends vote against both."
                    "Certainly," said I, "we shall continue to vote against every proposal
                    that does not appropriate a portion of the interest for the support of the Common Schools. I am
                    rather in favor of loaning it out in the Counties, but I tell you plainly, I will join the Bank
                    party, and so will the other friends of education, if that party will give us a portion of the
                    proceeds for education."</p>
            <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-025-1-063"/>
            <p>"Well," said Vandaver, "it is true that I have always voted against the
                    education proposition, but, after all, it is not so very unreasonable. Suppose you [we] were to
                    allow something for education, would you assist us to get the money loaned out in the
                    Counties?"</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"Suppose we allow you two per cent, for education? That is a fourth of the whole
                    proceeds."</p>
            <p>"It is not enough."</p>
            <p>"We beat you on that proposal already."</p>
            <p>"True, and we beat you afterwards on yours."</p>
            <p>At last, it was agreed between us, that we would mutually support a Bill providing that the Surplus
                    Revenue be loaned out in the Counties, one-third (2 and 2/3 per cent.) of the proceeds to go for
                    education and the remaining two-thirds for Internal Improvement.</p>
            <p>We met that evening after supper, sat up till midnight, and before we departed, drafted a bill to our
                    mutual satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The next morning, as soon as the House met, I moved to suspend the rules and take up the Surplus
                    Revenue question. Vandavar then moved to amend the bill on the subject [which was] then before the
                    House, by striking it from the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof our compromise bill.
                    The Internal Improvement party were completely taken by surprise; for Vandavar, though not a leader
                    among them, nor a speaker, had hitherto been staunch and even violent on their side and carried some
                    weight with them. That he and I should be found fighting side by side, quite threw them out in all
                    their calculations.</p>
            <p>Various propositions were made to amend the bill. Some by our friends, and these I opposed; some by
                    Vandaver's, and these he opposed, such being our agreement. Among the former was a proposal
                    from Col. [Abel C] Pepper, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> [County], a staunch friend of education, to alter one third into one half.</p>
            <p>Pending the discussion of the Surplus Revenue Bill, on motion by Mr. Pepper to change the proportion
                    of the proceeds appropriated to Common Schools from <hi rend="i">one third</hi> to <hi rend="i">one
                        half</hi> of the same, Mr. Owen said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I fully appreciate the motives of my friend from <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                            </placeName> in making this proposal. I do more, sir. I coincide with him in feeling; I
                            agree <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-025-1-064"/> with him in opinion. I hold that at least one half
                            of the proceeds from this surplus revenue ought to be appropriated to education. You
                            know— the House knows—sir, that I have always held, and always
                            unflinchingly expressed that opinion.</p>
                        <p>But, sir, it is a give and take world, this we live in. We can not, all of us, have just what
                            we wish. We are every day called upon to sacrifice our fancies, our darling projects. Have
                            you ever seen a raw countryman elbowing his way, for the first time in his life, perhaps,
                            with uncompromising rigidity, through the crowded streets of some populous city? How slowly,
                            how uncomfortably he progresses! Why, sir? Because he has yet to learn, that where men
                            jostle each other, public comfort as well as individual success requires that each should
                            yield a little; that each should go a trifle out of his way to accommodate his neighbor. As
                            spoilt children sir, in indulged infancy—we may dream that we shall always obtain
                            just what we desire—that we have but to rush forward to our wishes and obtain
                            them. In after life, sir, when we have trodden the world's busy paths during a few
                            years of struggle and experience, we learn, to our regret, that, when we can not have all we
                            will, we must take what we can; that we must consult other inclinations as well as our own,
                            or, we shall soon be elbowed out of the path altogether, and lose even that little which
                            prudence and compromise might have saved us. Compromise! the word has been objected to. Is
                            it not a good word, sir? Does it not designate a good thing? What is a compromise? Is it
                            anything unjust? Is it anything dishonorable? What is a compromise? It is this. You can not
                            obtain all you want. I can not obtain all I want. We both cede a little. We both give up our
                            first choice. And we unite upon a medium proposition: something that is more palatable to me
                            than your proposal, and more palatable to you than mine. Is not this a reasonable, a proper,
                            an honorable course? As the gentleman from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Putnam</settlement>
                            </placeName> has well remarked, our very constitution—the constitution of the <placeName>
                                <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                            </placeName> itself—is but the result of a compromise. And what great and
                            exciting question—the Tariff or any other—has ever been settled in
                            this country except by this very mode—now almost imputed to us as a dishonorable
                            secession from principle—by this very plan of prudent, moderate, reasonable
                            compromise.</p>
                        <p>Such a compromise has been made, I am free to admit it, between the gentlemen from <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Orange</region>
                            </placeName> and myself. The bill before you is the result. It is not my first choice. It is
                            not his. But such as it is we will both stand by it. It gives one third of the proceeds of
                            the revenue to education. More than this I will not ask, less I will not accept.
                            Reluctantly, therefore, but from a strong sense of the prudence and necessity of the course,
                            I shall be compelled to vote against the proposal—so congenial to my
                            feelings—made by the gentleman from <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Dearborn</region>

            <p>Col. Pepper withdrew his proposal. After a debate which lasted' from nine o'clock
                    till five, in which all of the principal speakers of the House, Marshall, Jeff [Thomas J.] Evans,
                    Gen. [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>] Stapp, Caleb [B.] Smith, Marks Crume, etc., spoke long and loud against the bill, and
                    in which Col. Pepper and <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-025-1-065"/> myself were almost the only speakers in
                    its favor, our bill was engrossed by a handsome majority. The next day it passed our House by a
                    still larger one.</p>
            <p>In the Senate it was modified, so as to invest one half in bank stock, the proceeds to go to Internal
                    Improvement, and the other half to be loaned out in the Counties, the proceeds to go for Common
                    Schools.</p>
            <p>When it was returned to us for concurrence Vandaver reminded me of our mutual agreement to stand by
                    the original bill. I told him that though I really preferred the Senate's amendment,
                    inasmuch as it provided a larger fund for education, yet, I would not go back from our original
                    proposal, so long as he adhered to it.</p>
            <p>In the course of the debate, however, Vandaver and his friends, beginning to fear that things would
                    go against them, thinking to force all the friends of education to support their original bill,
                    moved that the whole be invested in bank stock, the entire proceeds to go for Internal Improvement.</p>
            <p>This was a foolish blunder; more especially as it absolved me from all obligation further to support
                    the [Owen's] original bill. Proffitt, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> [County], made a short, spirited speech, calling on all the friends of Internal
                    Improvement to rally and support Vandaver's proposition, and accusing us of deserting him.
                    To this I replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I have a few remarks, sir, a very few, and they are in reply to the short, but spirited
                            speech just delivered by the gentleman from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                            </placeName>. His proposal is to place the whole in the banks, and take the
                            proceeds—the undivided proceeds—for Internal
                            Improvements—to take all from the counties and all from education. And he asks us
                            "why should we be afraid to do it". I'll tell you,
                            sir,—I'll tell him—why should we be afraid to do it. Because,
                            when we do it, we do it not for ourselves alone, but for others. Because, when we do it,
                            there are witnesses to the deed. Because, when we do it, there is an after reckoning for the
                            deed. The people are our witnesses. We are acting for them. We are responsible to them.
                            Between them and us, sir, is the after reckoning; an after reckoning that may decide for
                            some of us whether we are to return hither or not. That reckoning is at hand, sir. The
                            account has to be rendered soon. There's the rub. That, sir is the reason why we
                            should be afraid—why every upright man may well be afraid—to act in
                            direct opposition to the people's will.</p>
                        <p>But the education men (so the further accusation runs) have abandoned the gentleman from <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Orange</region>
                            </placeName>. He has abandoned US! Whence does this proposition emanate? Why, from him, sir,
                            from his friends. Time it is we should abandon him. No, sir, I will not say that. I trust
                            always to remain his friend. My hand in kindness I shall never refuse him. But <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-025-1-066"/> as politicians here we sunder. He has departed from us. We but
                            follow his example. And now he stands on one side of the Rubicon, we on the other. To place
                            the whole in the counties was my first choice. This amendment from the Senate is my second.
                            The proposal to place no money in the counties and give no proceeds to education is not even
                            my third, no, nor fourth, nor fifth, nor ANY choice. Between it and the proposal before us
                            the election is to be made. I go for the Senate's amendment, both hands up.</p>

            <p>In the course of half an hour afterwards [January 31, 1837] the Senate's Amendment passed by

            <p>Robert Dale Owen, by his benign and courteous manners, by his evident honesty and sincerity in trying

               <hi rend="i">A Bibliography of the Laws of Indiana, 1788-1927.</hi> By John G. Rauch and Nellie C.
                    Armstrong. <hi rend="i">Indiana Historical Collections</hi>, volume XVI, Indiana Historical Bureau, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1928. Pp. xxxix + 77, $1.00.</head>
            <p>We are told in the preface that this bibliography grew out of the undertaking of Mr. Rauch to prepare
                    a catalogue of his extensive collections of original printings of the acts adopted by the several
                    lawmaking bodies which have legislated for the territory now forming the State of Indiana. The
                    instant work is an expansion of the catalogue prepared by Mr. Rauch into a complete bibliography by
                    supplying the few missing items from other sources and adding such collation of title pages and text
                    as would readily identify each publication. The bibliography covers publications of session laws and
                    revisions issued officially by Territorial or State authority as well as certain privately compiled
                    revisions or reprints which cover a single session or a longer period. Official and private
                    publications of single laws, or collected laws upon a single subject are not included.</p>
            <p>Many interesting historical facts are revealed by this bibliography. It is almost startling for those
                    of us who have been trained to think of the three independent and coördinate branches of
                    the government as inseparable from democratic institutions to read, "Laws of the Territory
                    of the <placeName>

                    Territory at their Second and Third Sessions, Begun and Held at Saint <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 30th January 1802, &amp; February 16th, 1803." A half forgotten
                    historical fact is suggested by "Laws for the Government of the District of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>, Passed by the Governour and Judges of the Indiana Territory, at their First Session,

                    </placeName>, on Monday, the first day of October, 1804." In the preface is pointed out a
                    curious circumstance in connection with the numbering of the General Assemblies. It seems that the
                    General Assembly just following the forty-third was misnumbered the forty-fifth, and that this error
                    has been continued in regard to all subsequent ses- <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-025-1-068"/> sions. Dr.
                    Christopher B. Coleman, who writes the preface, suggests that this is probably due to the
                    interposition of a special session of the Legislature following the forty-third session.</p>
            <p>The bibliography contains a complete list of the collections of special and local laws and in reading
                    through the list one is reminded that prior to the adoption of our present constitution a
                    considerable part of the legislative output consisted of special and local laws, the granting of
                    divorces being quite commonly the subject-matter of special legislation. A bi-lingual period in the
                    development of Indiana is suggested by encountering in this bibliography the following: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>This new biography of George Rogers Clark, published on the eve of the one hundred fiftieth
                    anniversary of the most stirring events of his life, is a timely one. The volume is all that we
                    might expect from the pen of one who for more than twenty years has been a collector of material
                    pertaining to the career of George Rogers Clark. This quest, Professor James tells us, was not
                    confined to the manuscript collections such as the well known Draper Manuscripts of the <placeName>

                    the Archives of foreign countires, notably, <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>,
                            <country reg="fr">France</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. The result of this activity has been the publication of two volumes of <hi rend="i">Clark Papers</hi> in the <hi rend="i">Collections</hi> of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> State Historical Library, covering the period from 1771 to 1784. Other volumes are to
                    follow.</p>
            <p>The Life is based almost entirely on this collection of source material. It is not a eulogy, yet it
                    is a sympathetic interpretation of Clark's career, covering the period from his birth in
                    1752, on a farm adjacent to the estate of the Jeffersons near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Charlottesville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    to the time of his death, near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, in 1818. The volume is more than a
                    biography, it is a real contribution to the history of the West during the American Revolution and
                    the years which immediately followed.</p>
            <p>Among the best portions of the volume is that dealing with the part taken by the Spanish in the
                    Revolutionary War in the West. For the first time, the aid given to Clark and to Congress by Oliver
                    Pollock, supported by Governor Galvez of the Province of Lousiana, receives adequate treatment.
                    Pollock is aptly termed, the "Financier of the Revolution in the West." The
                    relationship of the military movements in the upper <placeName>

                    </placeName> frontier, has been brought into clear perspective. The refusal of Colonel Daniel
                    Brodhead, commander at Fort Pitt, to cooperate with Clark, in 1781, is given as the probable cause
                    of the failure of the contemplated expedition against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> which was planned for that year.</p>
            <p>On the mooted question concerning the part that Glark's capture of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> the western boundary at the close of the Revolution, Professor James takes a middle
                    ground between those who claim that the conquest was the primary cause for the favorable boundaries,
                    and others like Alvord who maintain that it had nothing to do with it. Admitting that the
                    friendliness of Lord Shelburne and his desire to regain the good will of the Americans doubtless had
                    its effect, the author thinks that a knowledge of the fact that Clark occupied a strategic position
                    at the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> at the close of the Shawnee Campaign of 1782, served to confirm Shelburne in his
                    decision. This position enabled Clark to dominate a larger area in the Northwest than was actually
                    in his military possession.</p>
            <p>Nearly one half of the volume is devoted to the career of Clark and frontier problems, following
                    1783. The main incidents in this period of Clark's life, such as the seizure of the
                    property of three Spanish merchants who had come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to trade in 1786, the offer made to Genet to lead an expedition against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the acceptance of the commission of brigadier general from the French Government,
                    are interpreted in the light of frontier conditions, as they should be. The attitude of the Spanish
                    officials in regard to the navigation of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> by Americans
                    aroused great hatred towards <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, throughout the West. At the same time, the Confederation Government was weak and the
                    people of the West had little confidence in its ability to redress their grievances.</p>
            <p>All students of western history will welcome this new Life of Clark, by far the best one which has
                    yet been published.</p>

            <p>The history of American frontier life has no more thrilling chapter than the story of the struggles
                    of the colleges founded in the middle west around the beginning of the second quarter of the
                    nineteenth century. Nor is there a more important chapter to the student intent upon discovering the
                    directive forces which have determined the trend of life in this section of our country. For these
                    small colleges, stretched like a line <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-025-1-071"/> of forts along the
                    frontier of that day, were centers from which the culture of the <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> states permeated the North Central region, giving this new population group not only a
                    high general intelligence but a hospitality to sound scholarship which has been unusually productive
                    of the scientific, literary, political and industrial leadership of the nation. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Colony was such a center of stimulation in Indiana, but for the most part we are
                    indebted throughout the central west to the colleges.</p>
            <p>No institution has performed a more distinguished service of this kind than <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> College. Founded by a "Yale Band" of scholars, responding to the
                    appeal of a "Home Missionary Preacher," it brought to the frontier of a century
                    ago the Yale scholarship and catholicity of mind wedded to religious fervor, combining the
                    contributions of class room and chapel in the making of a great commonwealth, and sending its
                    influence to the ends of the land.</p>
            <p>President Rammelkamp tells the story of his College well. It is a book one reads through in one
                    sitting. One feels in its pages the devotion which only twenty-three years of consecrated labor and
                    personal sacrifice will give. It is like a mother's love. The author has the historical
                    sense. This has enabled him to make the unfolding story show the evolution of the College. The book
                    is thus a contribution to the history of education of great value, and also an effective appeal to
                    the appreciation of the constituency of the institution. It is a splendid "case
                    study" in educational history.</p>

                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    "Burns of the Mountains." No other but Burns could tell the story. The one regret
                    of the reviewer is that the author did not write a much more extensive volume. Burns, when a boy or
                    fourteen, earned the money to buy books and get a little schooling by digging ginseng. A country
                    school was started three miles from his father's home in West Virgina. <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-025-1-072"/> Knowing no other way to obtain the money for books, he decided in favor
                    of the "sang hoe". "Accordingly", he writes, "I took to
                    the woods and with 'sang hoe' and 'sang bag'." He could
                    "sang" through the mountains to the new schoolhouse in the process of
                    construction, "inspect it," and then "sang" back home. At the
                    age of sixteen, the curriculum of this first school had been mastered.</p>
            <p>The father was a mountain circuit rider who had left the hills of eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to get away from the feuds. He died soon after the son completed his course at the
                    country school. It was not long until young Burns returned to the old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> home at the forks of the Bull Skin, then forty miles from the nearest railroad. Here he
                    became involved in a feud, on one side of which his family had been ranged for years. His clothes
                    were sometimes "pierced by bullets". He passed through four years of hair-breadth
                    escapes", but did not lose his life, nor take a life. In the last fight in which he
                    participated, he was beaten over the head with the butt of a rifle, and thrown over a paling fence
                    "into a patch of tall weeds", supposedly dead; but he did not die.</p>
            <p>He recovered from the blow. He wandered alone. He pondered deeply. He saw life clearly. His feud days
                    were over. He left the hills. He found his way to Dennison University where he attended college for
                    a few months. Again he returned to the hills of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, still thinking deeply on his problem. It was not long until he founded The Oneida
                    Institute. This was his plan for stopping the Howard-Baker feud. The Institute still lives, and
                    Burns is still the President. Year after year for almost thirty years, many mountain children have
                    been taken care of at this school. During all these years "Burns of the Mountains"
                    has clung to his ideal. He has the faith of a prophet of old. At the end of his book he says:
                    "The work of Oneida Institute has scarcely begun. It shall be carried on into the ages, a
                    heritage for generations yet unborn."</p>

            <p>A volume of two hundred fifty-eight pages, <hi rend="i">Lincoln the Hoosier</hi>, by Dr. Charles
                    Garrett Vannest was brought out last fall by the Eden Publishing House of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The volume treats rather extensively that portion of Lincoln's life which was
                    spent in Indiana. From the age of seven to twenty-one, the boy was under the influence of the
                    environment of southwestern Indiana. The period was from 1816 to 1830, when pioneer conditions
                    prevailed. The author declares that his purpose in writing the book was to prove that Lincoln was a
                    Hoosier. He feels that he has succeeded in demonstrating this, and also in showing that the youth of
                    Lincoln was not spent in a "cramped cultural environment." His simple formula is
                    that "Lincoln's blood and environment explain him", and, with this in
                    mind, the volume is mainly devoted to these two factors.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Kate Milner Rabb has written a monograph with the engaging title, <hi rend="i">Indiana Coverlets
                        and Coverlet Weavers.</hi> This study has appeared as Number 8 of Volume 8 of the Indiana
                    Historical Society <hi rend="i">Publications</hi> (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1928). The author has gathered much data relative to the history of the art of weaving
                    coverlets in Indiana. Through this process, as through that of "piecing quilts" of
                    colorful and varied patterns, pioneer women satisfied some of their longings for beauty, a thing
                    rare enough in frontier days. The reasons that gave rise to coverlet weaving in pioneer Indiana, are
                    still operative in the mountain areas of the South, where skill in weaving
                    "kivers" has not yet vanished. It is a good sign that there is at present a
                    widespread appreciation of the kind of art which <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-025-1-074"/> frontier life
                    fostered. Mrs. Rabb has done well to delve into this subject She concludes truly that,
                    "perhaps half the charm of coverlet study comes from the fact that in it one reads so much
                    of the story of the Indiana pioneer."</p>

            <head>Comment and News</head>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly</hi> for March (1929) carries an excellent article by George
                    Alexander Johnston on the "New Biography". Emil Ludwig, André Maurois
                    and Lytton Strachey are treated as the outstanding examples of phenomenal success in this kind of
                    writing. These authors with the instincts of novelists, and possessing much the same skill in
                    drawing characters and portraying dramatic events, have become biographers in competition with
                    trained and untrained historians of the old school. Untrained and uncritical writers need not here
                    be considered. These we shall have with us as long as publishers will accept their manuscripts and
                    readers buy their books.</p>
            <p>In regard to scholarly and critical biographers of the regulation type, certain it is that they are
                    at a disadvantage when pitted against a Ludwig or a Strachey. Whether lacking a sense of the
                    dramatic or not, they are unwilling to employ it extensively, knowing too well that no
                    man's life is a series of thrilling episodes. From the literary angle, the sane reader
                    tires of the power with which authors with the genius of the three above mentioned writers deliniate
                    character, certain that he is being presented with distorted portraits. He often longs for a plain
                    statement of facts and a style that will leave him some opportunity to construct pictures of men and
                    scenes for himself. The man with the gift of a novelist, who turns bioographer, may sometimes be as
                    much out of place as the prosaic, scholarly biographer who tries to produce a novel, except in the
                    matter of financial returns from an undiscriminating public.</p>
            <p>Not only have present day readers access to a few unusual biographies by writers of rare talents, but
                    they are confronted with a flood of books, biographical and historical, from the pens of journalists
                    who have turned historians overnight. Their productions sell readily. Interesting and easy to read,
                    the perusal of one volume calls for another to take its place. Our contemporary journalistic
                    historians delve into a few sources with an instinct for news and select what readers are sure to
                    enjoy. Almost before making a beginning, they all feel sure that they understand men and events of
                    the past <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-025-1-076"/> better than any of the scholarly writers who have
                    already made such "pitiful" efforts at writing. Any man, event, or time that the
                    journalistic writer gathers no new material about, he writes up on the basis of what he remembers
                    from school histories or what he has picked up incidentally. He writes just as fluently about what
                    he does not know as about what he knows. He consigns men to the lowest depths or lauds them to the
                    skies. Though most leaders were gray, he pictures them as either black or white.</p>
            <p>How long will the present craze for the hurried, half-true, but entertaining books produced by such
                    writers continue? Probably until real searchers for the truth develop the power to present their
                    findings to the reading public in more appealing language. Perhaps workers in the field of history
                    ought to be compelled to acquire experience in journalism prior to the perpetration of volumes on an
                    unappreciative public. There would seem to be a greater need, at present, that journalists, who feel
                    the urge to write history, should be required to take a course in historical criticism, before being
                    permitted to feed their half-baked efforts to unprotected readers.</p>
            <p>Teachers in the public schools and even college professors are confronted with a danger that is
                    usually unseen. The common belief that anyone who has acquired a certain amount of education will
                    always retain at least that much is erroneous. Teachers can become uneducated while engaged in the
                    process of teaching, and enough there are who travel this road. Teachers of history in senior and
                    junior high schools are not free from this menace. They must read and reflect on something, however
                    little, beyond what is required of them in the way of the daily preparation of lessons, or gradually
                    lose value as teachers of history. The college teacher with a doctor's degree may be, and
                    occasionaly is, handicapped by the possession of the title. The attainment of the degree is a step
                    that should mean a preparation for continued progress. It sometimes means the end of real endeavor.</p>
            <p>To the high school teachers of history in Indiana a few suggestions may not be out of place. Large
                    numbers spend summer sessions and other periods whenever possible in further study. To those who
                    attend some university at every opportunity less need be said than to others. All can profit by <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-025-1-077"/> regularly reading one or more magazines of history. From this
                    sort of reading there comes a stimulus that no teacher of history can afford to miss. University
                    graduates engaged in presenting history to high school classes, frequently have good opportunities
                    to study some phase or phases of local history. Many such teachers have the ability, or may easily
                    acquire it, to do effective research of this kind. If only a few will look about them with seeing
                    eyes and discerning minds, valuable source matter will be found in collections of old letters, in
                    old newspaper files, and stored in the memories of older men and women. The process of collecting
                    information from such sources will be worth while in itself. If after having collected, assimilated,
                    and correlated a sufficient mass of material, a saving few will carefully prepare papers for
                    publication in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, they will do themselves and all
                    who are interested in the history of the State a real service.</p>
            <p>In the January (1929) issue of the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi> appeared certain
                    comment (p. 441) relative to the September (1928) number of our own quarterly. After mention of the
                    principal articles included in that issue, this criticism followed: "It is submitted with
                    all due respect and becoming humility, that this number of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>,
                    particularly the Beveridge article, carries more than its permissible quota of typographical
                    errors." The <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> acknowledges with sorrow the entire justice of this
                    comment. His spirit was weighed down with the burden of the designated errors for many days before
                    his attention was thus kindly directed to them. He can only plead certain facts in extenuation of
                    poor work done. It was necessary to rush the September number. The editor was new and the clerk was
                    new. Many of the student printers employed by the University Press were new, and a few of the worst
                    errors were made while others were being corrected. We can only hope for improvement in ourselves,
                    and state that we were saddened to note that our great contemporary carried the erroneous title,
                    "Economic Background of the Liberal Party" (<hi rend="i">Liberty Party</hi>, it
                    should have been), as a heading through seven pages. We do not know the "permissible
                    quota" for an error of this nature.</p>

                    Lincoln, grandfather of President Lincoln, in the January (1929) number of the <hi rend="i">Register.</hi> Readers of the paper on Hananiah Lincoln by Louis A. Warren, which we print in
                    this issue, will be interested in examining the matter furnished by Mrs. Cannon. The question taken
                    up by her is: "Where did Thomas Lincoln, father of President Lincoln, get the money to pay
                    for the Mill Creek farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hardin County</region>

                    <hi rend="i">Register</hi> for January, 1924, Mrs. Cannon presented what she then thought to be a
                    correct answer to this question. She now presents evidence which seems to cast doubt on her earlier
                    conclusions. Incidentally, she has learned that Lincoln's grandfather, though not a
                    scholar, was quite able to write his name and transact business in legal form. Another point of
                    interest and worth noting is that the Christian name of Thomas Lincoln's mother, according
                    to Mrs. Cannon, was "Bathsheba."</p>
            <p>The cover page picture of this issue is reproduced from Maurice Thompson's <hi rend="i">Stories of Indiana</hi> (p. 48), by the courtesy of the American Book Company of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Continentals was used. With a very commendable desire to represent more
                    correctly the appearance of the frontiersmen who marched with Clark, the picture, which we use, was
                    substituted in a revised edition by the publishers.</p>
            <p>On February 25, one hundred fifty years after the event, the capture of Fort Sackville by George

                    born was not recognized for a hundred years. During the last half century a notable change has taken
                    place, and due credit has now been accorded to Clark, Pollock, and others who participated in the
                    remote but significant activities of the Revolutionary War in the West. Clark and his associates did
                    not accomplish everything in the saving and holding of the Old Northwest. They must share the glory
