                    </placeName> measure of 1854, the "Appeal of the Independent Democrats" was given
                    to the public. It was the the work of Senator Salmon P. Chase. It was signed by him, Senator Charles
                    Sumner and four members of the House.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The "Appeal" was widely
                    published, and excerpts from it appeared in a vast number of newspapers. By the time the
                            <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Compromise had developed. Much of this was certainly due to the effectiveness of the
                    "Appeal", which included the following passages well calculated to arouse deep
                    hostility to the measure championed by Douglas: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We arraign this bill as a gross violation of a sacred pledge; as a criminal betrayal of
                            precious rights; as part and parcel of an atrocious plot to exclude from a vast unoccupied
                            region immigrants from the old world, and free laborers from our own States, and convert it
                            into a dreary region of despotism, inhabited by masters and slaves.</p>
                        <p>Take your maps fellow citizens, we entreat you and see what country it is which this bill,
                            gratuitously, proposes to open to slavery.</p>
                        <p>We appeal to the people. We warn you that the dearest interests of freedom and the Union are
                            in imminent peril. Demagogues may tell you that the Union can be maintained only by
                            submitting to the demands of slavery. We tell you that the safety of the Union can only be
                            insured by the full recognition of the just claims of freedom and man. The Union was formed
                            to establish justice, and secure the blessings of liberty. When it fails to accomplish these
                            ends, it will be worthless; and when it becomes worthless, it cannot long endure.</p>

            <p>Practical suggestions for giving direction and purpose to the inevitable protest against the bill
                    were offered. The signers promised to resist by speech and vote, but they asked for the support of
                    Christians and Christian ministers who believed in the brotherhood of men. Their protests should
                    take the form of letters, memorials, petitions, resolutions in public meetings and legislatures, and
                    editorials. If, in spite of their efforts, failure resulted, the signers declared that they would
                    return to their constituencies, "erect anew the standard of freedom, and call on the people
                    to come to the rescue of the country from the domination of slavery. We will not despair; for the
                    cause of human freedom is the cause of God."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>In the note appended to the "Appeal" appeared the politician's sharp
                    thrusts. Having appealed as if interested only in idealism and humanitarianism, in Christian
                    principles and the welfare of the nation, they now asked: "Will the people permit their
                    dearest interests to be thus made the mere hazards of a presidential game, and destroyed by false
                    facts and false inferences?"<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    all-night debate. The vote was 37 to 14. Four regular Democrats and Chase, an Independent Democrat,
                    voted against it. The four were Henry Dodge and Isaac P. Walker of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The last named became a prominent Republican and the first Vice-President elected by
                    that party. Fourteen Democrats from the free, states remained faithful to the Administration
                    leaders. Among them were the two <placeName>

                    Senator, Jesse D. Bright, did not vote.</p>
            <p>The final vote in the House was 113 to 100. The northern Democrats divided almost
                    evenly—44 to 43. At least three of the five Democrats from the free states who did not
                    vote were opposed to the bill. <placeName>

                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi> Chase, Sumner, Giddings, Wade and Gerritt Smith certainly kept their
                            pledge to resist the bill by speech and vote. To their aid came a goodly number of
                            Democrats. Some participated in the debates; more supported them with their votes. Of the

                            </placeName> and Indiana, only one spoke against the Bill. That one was Representative

                            suggestions in the "Appeal" in regard to the methods to be used or not,
                            they certainly did not omit any of the proposed methods in the fight that followed.</item>

                    considerable, for half of the Democratic congressmen from the free states refused to obey the
                    dictation of the party leaders.</p>
            <p>While the Senate Chamber was resounding to the sonorous phrases of Sumner and the logical arguments
                    of Chase, great excitement prevailed throughout the North. During the debates in Congress speakers
                    often referred to the general agitation which rivaled that of 184–0. Then the crisis had
                    been bridged by a compromise which both party platforms had accepted in 1852. As Chase remarked,
                    however, the peace of 1852 had turned into the storm of 1854.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Reference was
                    made to the "seething agitation" and to the "wild spirit of
                    discord" which was "poisoning the air."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Isaac P.

                            do all I can to prevent it; and when it shall come, as come I fear it must, no one will
                            deplore it more than I; but at the same time you will have deprived me of the power to deny

            <p>The repercussions from the excitement began to be felt in Congress very early. Less than a week<hi rend="sup">10</hi> after the publication of the "Appeal of the Independent

                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName> legislature were presented to the Senate. After February 9, petitions, memorials, and
                    remonstrances poured in almost daily. These were signed sometimes by single individuals; usually by
                    large groups of citizens; a few were signed by women alone as the one by Harriet Beecher Stowe and
                    eleven hundred women of Andover, <placeName>

                    clergymen of all denominations. One hundred fifty clergymen of one <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Massachusetts county</region>
                    </placeName> sent Congress a memorial. Some days later there appeared a memorial signed by three
                    thousand fifty <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> clergymen. They opposed the repeal of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Compromise as a great moral wrong, as a breach of faith which was subversive of
                    confidence in all national contracts, as dangerous to peace and to the Union, and as an act exposing
                    the country to the righteous judgments of God. Senator Douglas demanded that it be read and then
                    delivered a fiery invective against it and the signers. Early in May, twenty-five ministers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> sent a petition to Douglas to be presented in the Senate, and a little later it was
                    followed by one signed by five hundred four clergymen of the northwestern states. The proceedings of
                    many of the mass meetings, which were being held in all parts of the free states, were presented in
                    Congress. The legislatures of <placeName>

                            </placeName> bill is a very ill-advised scheme and ought not to have been introduced. I do

                            </placeName> Compromise, or thant [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] it will thank Douglas for
                            introducing his proviso to that effect. Of course if <hi rend="i">one</hi> compromise is
                            annulled another can be, and, the North having the power, possibly <hi rend="i">may</hi> be,
                            in some particulars, before many years. It is certainly new to many that the Compromise of
                            1850 was intended as an annulment of that of 1820. Certainly no such avowal was made at the
                            time that Compromise was pending. The indecent haste of Douglas in attempting to force this
                            bill through the Senate without debate, and the various amendments he has at different times
                            proposed, shows [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] that he himself doubts its propriety or its
                            popularity. His wholesale denunciation of the opponents of the bill as
                            ‘abolitionists’ and ‘nigger’ sympathizers will
                            avail him but little. People are not to be frightened from their propriety by such epithets
                            now-a-days, whatever may have been their effect a few years since…,<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                        <p>In a word, then, the Douglas bill, (as it is understood out West here,) is exciting no little
                            interest. The popular voice is strong against any &amp; every measure having for its

                            by the acts of 1850, &amp; give the South all of its benefits, no one is willing to
                            [have] an additional foot of slave Territory to come into the Union. Personally I have not

                    independent weekly which he called <hi rend="i">Chapman's Chanticleer</hi>. The two young
                    partners, George H. Chapman and Horatio S. Garner, felt that the success of their venture depended

                    to write his opinions untrammeled by party management. The paper, he stated in the first issue, was
                    to be independent but not neutral, adding that "any chicken heart may be a neutral, but it
                    requires a stout heart of the real game cock breed to be really and truly <hi rend="i">independent</hi>."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Chapman, like Garber, had been too strongly

                    since the previous autumn. It cut squarely across party lines. The local option feature of the law
                    of 1853 had been declared void by the state Supreme Court. On January 11 the friends of temperance,

                    edtior of the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Sentinel</hi> maintained that it was not a political
                    question and therefore should not come before the convention. The plank on temperance did not
                    satisfy the temperance Democrats, even though it may have been designed for that purpose. It
                    declared intemperance to be a great moral and social evil which should be restrained by legislation,
                    but at the same time it opposed any law authorizing the searching for or seizure, confiscation, and
                    destruction of private property.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Men like James Blake who might have remained
                    loyal to the party on the <placeName>

                    when they met to select candidates for Congress. Morton's hopes of controlling the <placeName>

                    for Congress. This convention adopted resolutions which practically expelled from the party any

            <p>In the fourth congressional district convention Thomas Smith was expelled. He was one of the best

                    as member of the national House for three terms, and as a delegate to the state constitutional

                    of slavery over free territory. Had not his test amendment expressly giving the territorial
                    legislature full power to establish or prohibit slavery been defeated? He vehemently denied the

                    Such a convention had been recommended by the Free Democratic Association of the state which met in

                    "a great meeting of the people" and added that it was "high time for the

                    favor of it. However, the same issue did carry a call for a state convention which was signed by

                    secretary. Then, as was the custom, speeches were in order. Chapman once more stated his position on
                    the issue of the day and was followed by Reuben A. Riley, until very recently a member of the
                    Democratic state central committee. The crowd was treated to a "most thrilling and

                    these disappointed office-seekers "have found this a favorable opportunity to wreak their

                    Democratic insurgents did play a prominent role that day. Chapman served as temporary chairman;
                    Thomas Smith was named permanent chairman and was introduced by Garber. Four of the vice-presidents
                    belonged to the same element—J. P. Milliken, Dr. James Ritchey, O. P. Davis, (state

                    "self-styled" Democratic convention of the 24th of May for the benefit of the
                    insurgents. There was also a judiciously worded resolution on prohibition which it was hoped would

                    draw many new converts from among the temperance Democrats who had, of course, threatened to place
                    their own ticket in the field if both parties failed to take a sufficiently strong position on a
                    prohibitory law. George W. Julian, Free Soil leader, was even less pleased with the platform. His
                    minority report had been tabled. It stated much the same principles but in much clearer and bolder
                    terms. It did go further in saying that the <placeName>

                    termed the People's platform "narrow and equivocal." On the whole,
                    however, the fusionists were well pleased with their maiden effort.<hi rend="sup">75</hi>

            <p>The Whigs were willing to allow their Democratic allies the lion's share of the offices in
                    order to attract votes from the party which had dominated state politics for so many years. They
                    admitted that only by a breach in their opponent's ranks could they hope to overthrow them.
                    Luckily for the Whigs, then, just when their own organization seemed about to fall into ruin, the
                    break came in the other party. They were quick to seize the issue, to make the most of their
                    opportunity, and to remain in the background until their goal was accomplished. It is true that
                    they, themselves, had some deserters, but they expected to be more than compensated by the votes of
                    their allies. Defrees, himself, suggested that three places on the state ticket be assigned to the
                    Democratic insurgents.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> Accordingly E. B. Collins, Hiram E. Talbott and Dr.
                    William R. Nofsinger, all Democrats, were named for secretary of state, auditor, and treasurer,
                    respectively. Two Whigs, Samuel B. Gookins, and Caleb Mills, were nominated for judge of the
                    superior court and superintendent of public instruction.</p>
            <p>The interest of the campaign was divided between the congressional and state elections. In both cases

                        <country reg="-us">United State</country>
                    </placeName> Senator John Pettit. However, in the election of members of the legislature, the
                    paramount question was the "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> Law." Daniel Mace was the choice of the People's party in the eighth
                    Congressional district. Another Democratic insurgent was chosen in the eleventh district, where
                    Harlan refused to run again—John U. Pettit. In Chamberlain's district the

                    this district the fusionists, therefore, supported Samuel Brenton, a former Whig. In two other

                    co-operating in the support of common candidates. Had this been all, the Democrats might still have
                    been victorious, but there was the schism within its own ranks. The Know-Nothings furnished some
                    restless Democrats a convenient and secret bridge to full-fledged membership in a new party.<hi rend="sup">79</hi> A campaign charge was that the People's state ticket had been made

                    more than cut in half. John B. Norman wrote English that he would "be quite a

                    triumphantly vindicated his vote with a majority which almost doubled that received by him in 1852.
                    This was Daniel Mace. Chamberlain, who had opposed the bill but had been nominated by the regular
                    Democrats, was defeated along with the rest of their ticket. Three of the counties that had helped
                    him defeat Brenton in 1852 were now found in the latter's column. Only <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName> remained faithful. In Indiana five Democratic congressmen were defeated through
                    defections of their own partisans.</p>
            <p>Four Democratic insurgents were elected—Cumback, Barbour, Pettit, and Mace—and
                    they owed their victories to the support of their fellow "traitors," for it was
                    only by the addition of Democratic votes to a Whig minority in those districts that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> Democrats were overwhelmed. This can be demonstrated by a calculation of the
                    approximate number of insurgents in these districts. When the total vote of 1852 is compared with
                    that of 1854, it is seen that there was an increase. If this increase is apportioned between the two
                    candidates in proportion to the per cent of the total vote which each party polled in 1852, the
                    result shows that the Democrats received less than their full strength in 1854 and the Fusion
                    candidates received more than the full Whig strength. The difference, therefore, would represent the
                    approximate number of defections from the Democratic party. Of course, this argument rests on the
                    premise that all of the Whigs fused. This is not true, but for every Whig who went over to the <list type="footnotes">

                    increase in the estimated number of Democratic desertions. The problem is rendered comparatively
                    simple in Indiana because in no case was there a third candidate running in any district in 1852. By
                    use of this method of calculation, it is discovered that Democratic insurgents ranged from about 850
                    in Cumback's district to about 2,000 in Mace's district. Since the latter included <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where observers had declared the desertion to be very general, it is interesting that
                    the figures bear out the truth of their statements. In 1852 the Democrats polled over fifty-five per
                    cent of the total vote in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but two years later the percentage dropped to but slightly more than thirty-four. Thus
                    it can be concluded that the revolt reached deep into the party and affected the rank and file as
                    well as the leaders.</p>

                    in a district considered as Whig was not in keeping with the general results. Lincoln attributed it

                    their party unless they should gain the aid of other groups. Democratic editors after the election
                    were forced to admit that they had been defeated by their own men. The only question to be discussed
                    was which of the issues or <hi rend="i">isms</hi> had proved most enticing to restive members of
                    their party. At first the Democratic state organ of Indiana was inclined to place the blame for the
                    debacle chiefly upon the deluded Democrats who had become entangled in Know-Nothingism, but also
                    attributed their defeat to the "<placeName>

                    </placeName> humbug" and the ill-advised temperance plank which had lost them thousands of
                    votes. Later the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> seemed inclined to blame the temperance issue most. The
                    Whig organ of the state accredited their victory to the revolt of the people against political
                    corruption. It compared the mass movement to "a political sub-soil plough, turning up the
                    people from the bottom, and turning under the weeds that have grown rank upon them." Credit
                    was also given to "the universal and open desertion of their party by most of its ablest,
                    and all its conscientious leaders.—Their defeat has come… in part from the
                    rebellious sentiment of their own party, refusing to be whipped up to the support of any measure
                    that profligate leaders dared for personal advantage…. " Others interpreted it
                    as a victory for principle and as a rebuke to the Administration. Chapman hailed it as a victory of
                    the forces of good over those of evil. Garber considered the Know Nothings the weakest element in
                    the canvass, saying: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>But for the dissatisfaction in the ranks of the Democratic party in regard to slavery, free

            <p>Throughout our history, the West has always exerted a profound influence on the East. This influence
                    is not merely economic and political; it is cultural as well. Possibly there has been as much
                    liberalism in western culture as in western politics. John James Audubon was certainly progressive
                    when he conceived the idea of his <hi rend="i">Birds of America</hi>. His masterful effort to enlist
                    art to promote science was unusual to say the least. It was the height of audacity.</p>
            <p>Audubon's origin was long veiled in mystery. He would have us believe that his mother was a
                    Spanish lady, and that he was born near <geogName>Lake Pontchartrain</geogName>, <placeName>

                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, that Audubon was the natural son of Jean Audubon and a Creole woman, Rabin, and that
                    he was born at Aux Cayes, San Domingo, on April 26, 1785. In 1789 the child Audubon and his
                    half-sister were taken by the father, Jean Audubon, back to Nantes and presented by him to his
                    lawful wife, Anne Moynet Audubon. She welcomed the children cordially.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Imagine
                    such a situation and outcome in an Anglo-Saxon household! In 1794 the youngsters were legally
                    adopted as the children of Jean Audubon and his wife. Audubon passed his childhood, entertained by
                    the birds, and spoiled by his new mother, Anne Moynet Audubon. For a brief period in
                    180–, young Audubon studied drawing under the great David at <placeName>

                    received by the boy for the artistic work of his career.</p>
            <p>In 1803 occurred Audubon's first return to America. He came to learn English and to enter
                    trade. He settled on his father's farm at Mill Grove near <geogName>Valley

                    engaged to Lucy Bakewell, quarreled with his father's agent, Da Costa, and returned to <placeName>

                    enough of the foolishness of trying to succeed in business just to please their relatives, and, with
                    Lucy's complete approbation, Audubon decided to publish his work on ornithology. Thus, he
                    embarked on his marvelous artist-naturalist career. It was six years before he, in 1826, with his
                    drawings, finally sailed for Liverpool. The appreciation shown him by Europeans was inversely
                    proportional to that shown by Americans. Everybody welcomed and fraternized with the picturesque
                    artist-naturalist from the American frontier. A total stranger, his work spoke that universal
                    language of art which Europeans understand so well.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>

                    furnished Audubon with the necessary capital to go to Europe. The old principle of division of labor
                    was practiced until fame and money came to Audubon. Not the least influence in the success of the
                    great artist-naturalist was his wife, Lucy Bakewell Audubon. Audubon was a super-salesman. In all he
                    disposed of 165 sets of <hi rend="i">The Birds of America</hi>—82 in America at
                    $1000 per set and 83 in Europe at £182, 14 s. per set. His personality plus
                    his excellent work, enhanced by his beautiful artistry, made a well nigh irresistible appeal. A
                    first edition of <hi rend="i">The Birds of America</hi> now commands a price that ranges from

            <p>One day in the late summer of 1818 as he was viewing the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Henderson</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Audubon saw a man, with what looked like a hundle of clover on his back, land from a
                    boat. The man handed Audubon a letter of introduction which described the bearer as an "odd
                    fishquot;. It was Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, born in 1784 in Constantinople of a French father
                    and a German-Greek mother.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The stranger became the guest of Audubon for a few
                    weeks. During the first night of Rafinesque's sojourn, Audubon heard a commotion in his
                    guest's room which, on investigation, turned out to be Rafinesque in action. The visitor in
                    trying to kill some bats for rare specimens had completely demolished Audubon's beloved
                    Cremona violin. In a few weeks, Rafinesque disappeared and Audubon feared for his safety until word
                    was received from the eccentric naturalist. On leaving Audubon, Rafinesque had gone down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, reaching the settlement seven years before the Owens arrived. In 1819 Rafinesque
                    accepted the position of teacher of natural history and modern languages at Transylvania
                        University,<hi rend="sup">14</hi> then the most important seat of learning in the West.</p>
            <p>On applying for a master's degree, Rafinesque was at first refused, in his own words,
                    "Because I had not studied Greek in a college although I knew more languages than all the
                    American colleges united." He claimed acquaintance with more than fifty languages. This
                    versatile man was a botanist, chemist, anthropologist, conchologist, archaeologist, and
                    ichthyologist. He believed himself to be the inventor of the present coupon system of issuing bonds.
                    He attempted to patent a "steam plow", a "submarine boat", and
                    "incombustible housesquot;.</p>
            <p>In 1833, a quarter century before Darwin published his work, Rafinesque wrote: "There is a
                    tendency to deviations and mutations through plants and animals by gradual steps at remote irregular
                    periods. This is a part of the great universal law of perpetual mutability in everythingquot;.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    </placeName>, Audubon played a practical joke on the credulous scientist. Perhaps Audubon was out of
                    humor because his guest had wrecked his violin. Anyway he told Rafinesque about ten or twelve
                    fabulous fishes that inhabited the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> "further downquot;. One
                    was a sort of monster, four to ten feet long, accustomed to bask lazily in the sun, like a
                    crocodile, and impervious to rifle balls. Rafinesque eagerly seized the descriptions and published
                    them, to the complete consternation of ichthyologists, who have been busy for the ensuing hundred
                    years trying to unravel the tangle. Rafinesque's biographer, Richard E. Call, denounced
                    this bit of horse-play, but after all Audubon was only human.</p>
            <p>It is a curious fact that there was considerable that was fantastic about this science of the
                    frontier. Like gargoyles on a medieval cathedral and like the jesters in Shakespeare's
                    tragedies, this element of the fantastic somehow became part of serious, sober science. Richard Owen
                    drew a geological Map of the Globe, and, using arcs of great circles to bound his imaginary
                    geological areas, he made his map look like a conglomeration of problems in spherical
                        trigonometry.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                    able and correspondingly human. He was a giant in stature and was possessed of a dynamic temper.
                    Unfortunately, Dudley was as facile with a gun as he was with surgical instruments. One of the
                    associate professors was William H. Richardson, typical Kentuckian, scholarly, and of excellent
                    family. During a faculty meeting, Richardson criticized some suggestion of Dudley, whereupon Dudley
                    told him that if he did not keep his mouth shut, he would shoot his d——d head
                    off. Richardson offered to meet him any time, and a duel was arranged. They both fired
                    simultaneously. Richardson missed, but Dudley shot Richardson in the leg and severed the femoral
                    artery. Richardson would have bled to death if Dudley had not ligated the artery. After the
                    operation, the two duelists shook hands and were friends forever.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    Todd Crawford was suffering from internal complications. Two doctors on consultation advised that

                    saddlebags. McDowell's examination convinced him that only an operation would save the life

                    The death of Péron in 1810 and the downfall of Napoleon in 1815, brought sorrow and

            <p>In 1838 Owen resigned his Indiana position to accept an appointment from James Whitcomb, Federal Land
                    Commissioner, to make a survey of the <placeName>

                    hired and instructed his 139 assistants, and finished his work on November 14, "a feat of

                    artistic beauty. He also embellished his reports with scenic drawings of superb quality. Of the
                    twenty-five plates in Owen's report of 1840, fourteen are from his own drawings. Not only
                    was he an artist, but he used excellent English. Some of his descriptions, in beauty of language,
                    reflect the skill of an able writer of fiction.</p>
            <p>Audubon and Le Sueur were artists recognized abroad. Had the occasion arisen, Owen, would probably
                    have been recognized as an artist in Europe. These artist-scientists had no process of photography.
                    They made their own pictures, and anticipated modern photography in science. Incidentally, in making
                    their own pictures, they linked science with art and gave a double impetus to culture. Audubon was
                    appreciated in Europe before he was recognized in America, and, in Europe, the appreciation was
                    twofold—for his artistic as well as for his scientific work. His election to the Royal
                    Society, and to the Linnaean Society as well, was spontaneous. When the renowned Cuvier saw
                    Audubon's Birds of America, he hailed it as "The greatest monument yet erected to
                        ornithology.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

                    <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-033-1-049"/> The artist Redoute was just as enthusiastic as was Cuvier. Said
                    Gerard, the great portrait painter: "Mr. Audubon, you are the king of ornithological
                    painters. We are all children in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and Europe. Who could have expected such a thing from the woods of
                        America?"<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Thus, did <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> acknowledge its debt to the American frontier.</p>
            <p>It was in relation to Darwin, however, that Audubon really made history. In his famous books, <hi rend="i">The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man</hi>, Darwin has forty citations to the
                    works of Audubon.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> The same books by Darwin cite Gould forty-five times and
                    Alfred Wallace, sixty-six times.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Thus, Wallace is the only scientist whom
                    Darwin cites a considerable number of times more than he cites Audubon. And, it should be
                    remembered, that Wallace was, with Darwin, independent co-discoverer of the theory of evolution.
                    Thus the scientific influence of the American frontier on Europe is made manifest. While
                    Audubon's drawings entranced the world, his printed works became a source book for Darwin.
                    With no scientific training, Audubon collected information that made Darwin his debtor in the
                    development of the theory of evolution. If America was not culturally independent of Europe, she was
                    fast making the relation one of interdependence.</p>
            <p>Culturally the West had come into its own. It had demonstrated that it could contribute to the
                    advancement of knowledge. Audubon spent ten years of his life in <placeName>

                    knowledge of American bird life. Rafinesque, Le Sueur and Agassiz described and classified the

                    and accurately described more insects than did any man living. William Maclure and David Dale Owen

            <p>In telling the story of Consumer Coöperation in Indiana, as, indeed, in telling it of any
                    place, it is natural to start in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in 1843. For it was there in that year that the basic principles of
                    coöperation were laid down by a group of twenty-eight poor weavers in the Lancashire town
                    of Rochdale. Those principles are now known to the world as the Rochdale System. The idea of
                    coöperation, however, did not originate then; in fact, it is interesting to note that one
                    earlier but unsuccessful attempt of putting the coöperative idea into practice was made
                    by the British social reformer Robert Owen at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in the years 182–828. The coöperative colony he
                    established there failed in two short years because it was too paternalistic and because it lacked
                    the enthusiastic support of its members. These failings were avoided by the twenty-eight impecunious
                    weavers. It has been said that they "grafted a slip of Owenism on a stock of common
                    sense" and the offspring was the development of a set of Rochdale principles: that
                    membership be open and voluntary and without regard to politics, religion, race, or sex; that one
                    member have one vote; that dividends go to patrons in proportion to patronage; that capital invested
                    receive a low rate of interest; that goods be sold at market price; that reserve funds be set aside
                    from net earnings; and that education in regard to the value of coöperation be promoted.
                    These principles have been adopted, and are being adopted extensively, because they have proved
                    workable and because they have stood the test of time, with individual members finding themselves
                    better off.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiss here to make clear what the subject, Consumer Coöperatives, involves.
                    Often there is confusion between the terms "producer coöperatives and consumer
                    coöperatives." The term "coöperatives" includes
                    both, but which is which and where is the line drawn? Marketing coöperatives, as for
                    example the Indiana Wool Pool, the Producers Commission Association at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> stock yards, or the Farmers' Creamery at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, are organized to sell produce collectively, and are, therefore, producer
                    coöperatives. <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-033-1-052"/> There are also organizations whose purpose is to buy
                    collectively. Strictly speaking it depends on what they buy whether they are consumer or producer
                    coöperatives. If they buy consumer goods, such as groceries, they should be known as
                    consumer coöperatives. If they buy producer goods, such as fertilizer or twine or other
                    supplies used in agricultural production, they should be known as producer coöperatives.
                    Actually, the latter are often miscalled "consumer coöperatives," and
                    they are to be included under that term in this paper. They are the coöperatives under
                    the Farm Bureau, the others to be examined are true consumer coöperatives.</p>
            <p>Recent as it is, the story of the Farm Bureau coöperatives is older than any other in the
                    state. In 1920 the Indiana Farm Bureau, which was then one year old, established a joint
                    coöperative purchasing department in collaboration with other farm agencies throughout
                    the state for collectively bargaining for twine and fertilizer. In 1923 the Bureau established its
                    own purchasing department, which in 1927, when they discovered and applied the Rochdale principles,
                    became the Indiana Farm Bureau Coöperative Association. By Indiana law, that association
                    is open only to farmers. Today its membership is 50,000 with 50,000 more earning membership by
                    accumulating patronage dividends with which to buy stock. There are eighty-nine autonomous county
                    units which form ten districts in the state, which in turn form the state wholesale association. The
                    latter in its turn is a part of the national wholesale association, National
                    Coöperatives, Inc.</p>
            <p>In the period between 192–927, two noteworthy things happened. The first shows how a
                    coöperative's scope widens. The organized farmers in 1923 wanted a lower price
                    from the manufacturers of fertilizer. They bargained collectively for it, but to no avail. They
                    instigated a buyers' strike with no success. The situation was at an <hi rend="i">impasse</hi>, when, "out of the blue," a copper mine operator from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> appeared. He was burdened with a by-product, sulphur, from smelting his copper ore.
                    Sulphur fumes from his chimneys had destroyed plant life in the neighborhood, so the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Government stepped in and ordered him to trap them and abate the nuisance. He
                    obediently trapped the fumes, added steam, and disposed of the resultant sulphuric acid down the
                    creeks and rivers. Then the fish died and the streams became polluted. <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-033-1-053"/> The Isaac Walton League protested. At this point, he turned to the
                    organized farmers and offered them the sulphuric acid for manufacturing fertilizer. The result was
                    an agreement between the farmers of Indiana, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, and the copper mine operator, who now manufactures fertilizer which is distributed by
                    the Farm Bureaus of the three states.</p>
            <p>The second episode of the 192–927 period illustrates the importance of the Rochdale
                    principles of democratic control. Ten coöperative chain stores were set up over the state
                    to handle farm supplies. Each store was managed by a local manager who was hired by and responsible
                    to a general manager in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The farmer members who were to be benefited had no part in the control of the stores,
                    and correspondingly little interest in them. The local managers took their jobs pretty lightly, so
                    that by 1926, instead of patronage dividends to be divided, there was a deficit of
                    $12,000. Reorganization had to take place.</p>
            <p>It was at this time that I. H. Hull, present General Manager of the Farm Bureau
                    Coöperative Association, the late Lewis Taylor the leading light of Indiana's
                    coöperative movement, and the late James K. Mason came upon the story of the Rochdale
                    weavers. The result was the incorporation of the Indiana Farm Bureau Coöperative
                    Association, the wholesale unit which negotiates purchase contracts for its member associations.</p>
            <p>The members are the eighty-nine separate, autonomous county units, each with its own board of
                    directors and a manager chosen by the board and responsible to it. From their state organization the
                    farmers now buy at wholesale, and sell to themselves at the market price through their county units.
                    The savings are either returned to them or left in the business in return for common stock, as the
                    individual members may decide. Generally it is the latter.</p>
            <p>In speaking of consumer coöperatives, it comes out sooner or later that one of their
                    reasons for being is a desire to know that their purchases be of specified quality, with full weight
                    and full measure. The Indiana farmers in 1930 found themselves in the oil blending business because
                    they had been unable to get satisfaction from the commercial companies, the quality of whose oil,
                    they contended, fluctuated with prices. Since 1827 the state organization had been distributing to
                    the counties petroleum products purchased under contract from <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-033-1-054"/>
                    the oil companies. They knew that the life of farm machinery is lengthened by use of high grade
                    lubricating oils, and by 1930 they decided that the surest guarantee for high quality was to make
                    their own oil. Consequently, the state organization bought a building on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Avenue in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and turned it into an oil compounding plant which operates under the supervision of a
                    chemist. The coöperatives of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> have since become partners, and the Farm Bureau Oil Company, as it is called, now
                    blends quantities of oil of known quality.</p>
            <p>These examples of the activities of the farmers' organization by no means exhaust the list.
                    They deal in farm machinery, as well, operate eleven chicken hatcheries, which have cut down the
                    mortality rate of baby chickens, are sponsoring the Rural Electrification program of the government,
                    and will distribute power coöperatively. In fact, they have their fingers in many pies.</p>
            <p>One offshoot of the Farm Bureau is Coöperative Services, Inc., which is a true consumer
                    coöperative dealing in consumer goods. It is incorporated separately and the only real
                    connection it has with the Farm Bureau is that it buys from it wholesale, and its fifteen original
                    members were employees of the Farm Bureau office in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In other words the impetus for it came from people familiar with the methods of
                    coöperatives. Today, three years after its beginnings, there are 250 members of which
                    only one-fifth are connected with the Farm Bureau. They own two gasoline stations in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, they sell coal and coke to themselves, and also canned tomatoes and flour. The
                    gasoline and coal are purchased from the Farm Bureau Coöperative Association at wholesale
                    prices, the coke from a commercial company, the tomatoes from the coöperative cannery in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName>, and the flour from the Farm Bureau Mill at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By the end of 1936 this organization had done approximately $85,000 worth
                    of business, and distributed $5,000 to its patron members throughout the year at
                    intervals of three months. (Generally patronage dividends are distributed annually—they
                    involve tremendous amounts of labor and time in bookkeeping. Nevertheless the bookkeeping and
                    auditing are carefully and regularly done).</p>
            <p>Another urban consumer coöperative in Indiana, but one which grew up independently of the
                    Farm Bureau Coöperative <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-033-1-055"/> Association, is that owned
                    and run by the Negroes of Gary. When the depression came along the unskilled workers in the steel
                    mills in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> were hard hit. Many of them were Negroes. By 1932 one-half of the 20,000 who lived
                    there were on relief. One of them, a school teacher named Reddix decided to try doing something
                    about it. He gathered thirty Negroes together in a group for the purpose of studying economic
                    problems. At the time, they knew nothing of consumer coöperation, but shortly after the
                    group had been organized, they heard of it. Mr. Reddix was sent as a delegate to the Consumer
                    coöperative Conference sponsored by the National coöperative League, which
                    maintains the educational headquarters of coöperatives in America, to learn about them.
                    After he returned, and after the thirty members had absorbed the principles of consumer
                    coöperation, they collected $24.00 and started a buying club for groceries.
                    They pooled their orders for groceries, and bargained collectively to fill them. By the end of the
                    year they had acquired a ramshackle store and operated as the "Consumer
                    coöperative Trading Company." In the course of the years since then, their
                    business has expanded to $35,000 by keeping most of the earnings in the business, and
                    they now have a modern store on one of the main streets. One interesting and typical feature is that
                    they have developed leaders from among the ranks. They have mapped out a plan for the next five
                    years to open three more stores, to establish a credit union, a bakery, a milk distribution plant, a
                    filling station, a farm resort, and an insurance organization. The membership is now over 400.</p>
            <p>A word should be said here about credit unions. There are numerous industrial credit unions, and the
                    Farm Bureau has a Credit Union Department. They are consumer coöperatives in the sense
                    that they are non-profit organizations conducted for the benefit of their members. However, their
                    membership is naturally limited, in industry, to the employees, and, in the Farm Bureau, to its
                    members. But wherever consumer coöperatives have developed to any extent, credit unions,
                    such as the one planned at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName>, have followed in their wake, and, if and as they develop in Indiana, an increase may
                    well be expected in credit unions. The advantages of such unions are a lower rate of interest on
                    loans, and usually the acceptance of character as security or the basis of credit.</p>
            <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-033-1-056"/>
            <p>Consumer coöperatives in Indiana are, on the whole, so sparse and so new that it is
                    impossible to evaluate the movement here. There are two grocery coöperatives in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the process of incubation—one in the neighborhood of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> College and another in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There is the coöperative Trading Association, with a stand at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis City</settlement>
                    </placeName> Market, which is functioning at present. There is an organization in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, selling groceries which are purchased from the large coöperative
                    wholesale in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There is a coöperative book store in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">York</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Noble County</region>
                    </placeName>, run and owned by the teachers and pupils of a grade school. There is a one year old
                    coöperative house at Purdue University where the students have cut living expenses in
                    half by jointly renting the house and taking turns peeling the potatoes and doing the other chores.</p>
            <p>In spite of this list, though, consumer coöperatives in Indiana are not very far advanced.
                    In speaking of all coöperatives, producers and consumers, it may be said the producers,
                    that is, the farmers, are far ahead of the consumers in Indiana. This is pretty generally true of
                    all the Middle West. A fillip was given to the consumer coöperative movement last year by
                    the visit to this country of the great exponent of the movement, Kagawa, the Japanese Christian.
                    Now, to some extent, the churches in Indiana, both Protestant and Catholic, are encouraging study of
                    coöperation among their groups because they approve the spirit of it, and because they
                    see in it a more abundant life.</p>
            <p>One great emphasis, from the time of the Rochdale weavers to the present, has been on study and
                    education. Funds accumulated from the sale of goods to non-members are customarily used for
                    educational purposes, as well as reserves set aside from membership earnings. In <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Noble County</region>
                    </placeName>, these funds have been used for two years for summer schools to train leaders, who, in
                    the winter organize study clubs in the various townships. In general, however, programs for
                    education and recreation throughout the state are not well developed. Of course, literature may be
                    obtained without much difficulty because coöperative organizations are eager to spread a
                    knowledge of the system. In the literature, there is always a keynote of caution to groups, who are
                    urged to know the system and its principles before taking steps. They feel that knowledge and
                    understanding cannot be overemphasized.</p>
            <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-033-1-057"/>
            <p>Europeans have called America a "barren coöperative desert", but there
                    have been these recent signs of growth, such as we have seen in Indiana, which may alter their idea.
                    Whether or not the desert will eventually become a land flowing with coöperative milk and
                    honey, it is not within the province of this paper to forecast.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    </placeName> on October 1, 1936. Only those closely associated with him in his career as an
                    inventor, a philanthropist and an amateur historian can appreciate the full extent of the loss the
                    community and the state suffers in his passing.</p>
            <p>Mr. Herr was born in Lapland, Indiana, on April 21, 1875. His parents were pioneers of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>-German stock, who came to Indiana after a period of residence in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Herr's youth was spent on a farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone County</region>
                    </placeName>, to which his parents removed in the seventies. The Herr homestead, a large two story
                    log cabin, now stands in the Public Park of <placeName>
                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                    </placeName>, a permanent monument of pioneer Indiana preserved through the efforts of the D.A.R. of
                    that community.</p>
            <p>Shirl Herr's formal education included the completion of a district school course and a few
                    terms in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                    </placeName> High School. In addition to this formal training, he achieved much in the way of
                    self-education, especially in the science of agriculture. Seed selection in its relation to plant
                    culture was always of great interest to him and this interest led him to seek employment with one of
                    the outstanding seed companies of the Middle West, the Crabb Reynolds Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Herr came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1906, and, after Corking for the Crabb Reynolds Company for some years, he became
                    interested in the organization of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Seed Company. It was during the apprenticeship period in the seed industry, that Mr.
                    Herr married Miss Sarah Remley, daughter of another well known pioneer family. Mrs. Herr shared her
                    husband's interest in pioneer Indiana, and, through her, the family influence in the
                    activities of the local historical society has been continued.</p>
            <p>Shirl Herr's contributions to the seed industry were of first importance. He not only
                    improved but originated devices for the cleaning of seeds, and, up to the time of death, he was
                    working on methods to make seed winnowing more effective.</p>

            <p>Business was not his sole pre-occupation. He was a trustee of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Avenue Presbyterian Church, served in practically every organization interested in
                    community welfare, and was President of the Board when the new County Hospital building was erected
                    in 1929. His outstanding public service was recognized by the Kiwanis Club when he was presented
                    with an award as the most useful citizen.</p>
            <p>This memorial must perforce devote most of its space to his historical activities, but the demands of
                    space and time are not so pressing that we can pass without notice the services of Shirl Herr as a
                    citizen and scientist. He was a philanthropist in the finest sense of the word, for he gave to his
                    benefactions not merely his time and his money but himself. As chairman of the Hospital Board, he
                    had a foremost place in making the County Hospital one of the most efficient county hospitals in
                    Indiana, and, to the day of his death, he was following its fortunes with unwavering interest.</p>
            <p>To the world outside his immediate community, he is known as the inventor of the magnetic
                    balance—a device for locating underground minerals and metals. This instrument, he used
                    to locate the exact site of the Ouiatenon battlefield, and with it he retrieved metal aritifacts
                    from the battleground at Fort Necessity, Yorktown and other historic sites, including Jamestown and
                    Fort Niagra. The "balance" was also used by Mr. Herr when he was commissioned by
                    the Italian government to locate a Roman galley hidden beneath the waters of <geogName>Lake
                    Nemi</geogName>, and Thomas Poulter, second in command of the Byrd Expedition, found it a very
                    valuable addition to the scientific equipment of that expedition. These important scientific
                    accomplishments were not generally known, for Mr. Herr was unusually modest and reticent about his
                    achievements, whether such achievements had national or merely local significance.</p>
            <p>The members of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery County</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society knew him largely through his activity in saving and restoring <hi rend="i">Lane Place</hi>. This activity engaged all the time he could spare from his business
                    and his duties on the Hospital Board. From the time he was elected President of the Society, Mr.
                    Herr gave himself whole-heartedly to the task of preserving <hi rend="i">Lane Place</hi>. He won the
                    support of the City Council and Administrative officials, and through them the City bought up the
                    mortgage on the historic home. The building was transferred <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-033-1-060"/>
                    under a long term lease to the County Historical Society, with the proviso that the organization
                    refurnish the house and convert it into a memorial. To the very difficult task involved in meeting
                    this requirement, Shirl Herr brought a patience and energy that was an inspiration to those who
                    worked with him. Family heirlooms were returned and restored, materials reminiscent of the
                    Lincoln-Lane association were collected, and period furniture was obtained, as gifts or loans, to
                    fill in the gaps left when the family furnishings did not suffice. The collection for the pioneer
                    room was completed and Mr. Herr built up a representative exhibit of glassware as part of the Herr
                    Loan Collection to the Museum.</p>
            <p>It was this enthusiastic activity that won from his fellow-workers the recognition of Mr. Herr as an
                    amateur historian. This man with no particular historical training but with a traditional pioneer
                    background became, in a very real sense, the amateur historian—the lover of history.
                    Citizens of the larger world will remember him for his scientific achievements. Citizens of Indiana
                    may know him as a philanthropist and civic leader. The members of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Society, while not forgetful of these services, will also remember him as
                    one who cherished the pioneer traditions of Indiana and will recognize the fact that, in saving <hi rend="i">Lane Place</hi>, Shirl Herr not only preserved a permanent memorial to one of
                    Indiana's pioneer statesman, but furnished an example that should be an inspiration to all
                    those who are striving to save for posterity the memorials of our "living
                past."</p>

            <p>It is just an everyday sort of barn of unpretentious character that one finds near La Fontaine,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Indiana, but the building was once a haven of pioneer worship. This building
                    was originally erected in 1845, and was known as the Antioch Baptist Church. For thirteen years
                    following its construction, no records were kept by the congregation. In the first minutes, there is
                    an entry indicating that Elder John Sparks preached his first sermon in the Church on December
                    1,1858; his last sermon was delivered in November, 1862. He died in March, 1863.</p>
            <p>Elder Sparks, first preacher whose name appears in the records, settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1853, having come from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He purchased land near the little town of America, which later disappeared. He was a
                    brother of William Sparks, Baptist minister at the old log church of Cedar Grove, and uncle of
                    William Sparks, the second, who was also a pioneer Baptist preacher. Elizabeth Harlan, who became
                    the wife of Elder John Sparks, was also from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She came to Indiana with her parents in 1814.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The right to use the land on which the Antioch Church was built was granted without cost by Benjamin
                    Lines, a member of the congregation. His farm was mortgaged, and he lost it, but it was later bought
                    by Coon Lines, who sold the church site to the trustees for twenty-five dollars.</p>
            <p>The members of the Church as shown by the earliest records were: Thomas Lyons and wife, Elizabeth;
                    William R. Richards and wife, Rosena; Isaac Blades and wife, Martha; Silas Lines; Conrad Sellars and
                    wife, Chaterine; Harry Scott; Susan Sailers; Tobitha Frazee; Alfred Lines; and Benjamin Lines.</p>
            <p>Discontinued as a place of worship in 1883, the old Church was used as a dwelling by several
                    different families for a time. In 1903 the lot was purchased by the present owner, Mrs. Effie
                    Williams, great-granddaughter of Elder John Sparks. It was at this time that the old house of
                    worship was turned into a barn. The building was moved farther <list type="footnotes">

                    of the building was raised, some new siding used, and doors and windows changed.</p>
            <p>The present building reveals clearly the location of the two church doors at one end of the
                        building.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> One of these doors served as an entrance for the women of the
                    congregation, the other for the men, since they sat on opposite sides of the room. One of the doors
                    is boarded up completely. The other is closed part way, leaving room for a single window-sash above.
                    There is a shed on one side of the building. An inspection of the end opposite the old Church doors
                    and of the side opposite the shed, where none of the old siding of the Church remains, suggests
                    nothing whatever except a present day barn of modest size.</p>
            <p>The old Antioch Baptist Church which served a pioneer community for nearly forty years can be
                    recognized only on close inspection. The paths to its doors were once well trodden by the feet of
                    eager, believing persons. These paths were obliterated a number of, years ago, and the surroundings
                    changed. The members of the original congregation have all passed away, but the descendants of those
                    original members cherish the fast-fading picture of the old Church, as it was before the
                    transformation into the present-day barn. They think of it with reverence as a shrine of pioneer
                        worship.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    already in the Archives.</p>

                    </placeName>. The most plausible explanation is that they were used by William Robeson Holloway for
                    work upon the life of Oliver P. Morton, and that Mr. Holloway intended to make further use of them.
                    He had studied law with Morton at <placeName>

            <p>Indiana Territory, comprising a vast area far beyond the present limits of the state, was organized
                    in 1800. Admission to the Union came in 1816. Short indeed was the period when the colonists were
                    under the jurisdiction of a distant government on the Potomac. Outside the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> tract, the civilization to be found in Indiana when statehood was conferred was very
                    young and crude. The villages and farms, where lived nearly all of the meager population shown by
                    the territorial census of 1815, had only very recently been started. In short, for the first time in
                    the history of the world, the institutions of civilized people were being established on the soil of
                    frontier Indiana.</p>
            <p>For a number of years, after admission to the Union, Indiana remained a frontier colony of the older
                    part of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in all respects save in the matter of government. For a long time colonists flowed into
                    the young commonwealth while a very few left for still newer areas. They came from
                            <placeName>

               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, with very small contingents from any of the other older states. Foreigners, especially
                    Irish and Germans, swelled the stream somewhat, but, during the period of colonization, Indiana did
                    not receive foreigners in such proportions as did <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. This unusual fact caused Indiana to develop into a state quite different from the
                    other states of the Old Northwest in time. However, in the period prior to the great war between
                    North and South, Indiana was, in the main, a typical western state.</p>
            <p>By 1850, while colonists still flowed into Indiana, there was already a large movement away to newer

                    </placeName> between 1854 and 1860, it was, nevertheless, these three northwestern states that

            <p>During the half-century before the Civil War, Indiana was a great producer of hogs. In fact, it is
                    hardly too much to say that the early and rapid progress of civilization in the state was due to the
                    opportunity to produce swine extensively. For years, hams, shoulders, bacon and lard went to the
                    plantations of the deep South in great quantities, these products contributing much to the great
                    river traffic of the times. In the last period before the War, wheat rose to a place of high
                    importance, but much of this crop went eastward to market from the new wheat areas of the Old
                    Northwest. In 1850 the order of the upper five states in hog production was: <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana, <placeName>
                  <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. In 1860, the order was: Indiana,
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>, <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. The states ranked as follows in wheat production in
                    1850: <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>. The rank in 1860, shows quite a change: <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and then <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> in sixth place.</p>
            <p>Like other growing western states, Indiana gained in the number of Representatives in the national
                    House and also in importance in the electoral college. In the apportionment following the census of
                    1850, eleven members were assigned to Indiana in the lower branch of Congress. This placed the state
                    in a position of equality in regard to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, leaving only three of the original states, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, ahead in the national House. Of the new states, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> only, surpassed Indiana, while all others were behind. In the last decade before the
                    Civil War, the economic and political position of Indiana was high among the states of the Union.
                    This exalted relative rank, it has not been possible for the state to maintain in the great age of
                    transition through which the country has passed since 1865, but the <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-033-1-067"/> place is still high, and it is entirely possible that the relative
                    position of Indiana among the states may advance considerably in the next generation.</p>
            <p>These facts are recorded in order to convince teachers of history that Indiana has had an interesting
                    development—so interesting and significant that no teacher can afford to ignore the
                    history of the state. The problems of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName> and other British
                    provinces of the colonial period can be illustrated and explained by the experiences of the pioneers
                    who colonized Indiana. Likewise, the study of the establishment and development of civilization in
                    Indiana or in any other state of the trans-Appalachian region can be enriched and made
                    understandable by comparing and contrasting the similar establishment and growth of social, economic
                    and political institutions in the British colonies of the period before 1775.</p>
            <p>Nothing is easier to miss than the very significant fact that the greater part of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is not far away from the period of colonization. To consider the problems of the
                    country without due emphasis on this fact, means to misunderstand many of those problems. Much of
                    our strength goes back to the frontier era, but also many of the problems of today are difficult or
                    impossible of solution because of the rigid adherence to notions that became firmly fixed in the
                    pioneer period—notions that will not work in the complex situations of today.</p>

                    collection. These letters and dispatches reveal, in an intimate way, certain aspects of
                    Indiana's problems during the Civil War concerning contraband trade, defeatist
                    organizations, such as the Knights of the Golden Circle, and other important political questions of

                                                Building while the new Federal Court House was in the process of
                                                construction. Edward M. Holloway was then the Clerk and also the
                                                custodian of a large amount of Indiana archival documents which were
                                                kept in the office. His father. Colonel William R. Holloway, formerly
                                                Private Secretary to Governor Morton, came frequently to peruse the
                                                material, evidently with the intention of writing upon some aspects of
                                                Indiana history. He had already collaborated with William D. Foulke upon
                                                a biography of Governor Morton, but expected to complete an independent
                                                work of his own—a hope never realized. Whether he or the
                                                younger Morton was responsible for the transfer of the Indiana documents
                                                to <placeName>

                        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
                        <p>Yours of the 18th inst. enclosing copy of T. B. Monroe's of the 14th is at
                                    hand. Mr. Buchanan applied to me some time ago <hi rend="i">as a lawyer</hi> to
                                    endeavor to get his coffee for him. I then told him that if he would give me
                                    satisfactory assurances that the coffee should be sold only for home consumption
                                    that I would go out and get his coffee for him without fee or reward. This he
                                    declined to do and I declined taking any step for him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="i">The coffee is undoubtedly intended for the southern market</hi>. It
                                    strikes me that the best course would be to let the coffee come to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and then be seized by the collector. That places the matter in the
                                    hands of the U. S. government and releases Gov. Morton from all responsibility on
                                    the subject.</p>
                        <p>There is no fear of the collector at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> failing in his duty. If he errs at all it will be the other way.
                                    Messrs. Buchanan &amp; Co. are secessionists, but they are gentlemen whose
                                    promises would be held sacred and if they gave assurances that the coffee should be
                                    sold only for home consumption in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Ky.</region>
                                    </placeName>, I would not hesitate to let it pass.</p>

                        <p>Feeling it to be my duty under existing circumstances, and in obedience to the laws
                                    of our country, to give all the information in my possession to arrest the progress
                                    of traitors and to bring to justice all offenders, I beg to call your most earnest
                                    attention to the following case which I hope and trust you will take immediate steps
                                    to ferret out:</p>
                        <p>About the middle of May last, Carey W. Barbour and Wolsey Barbour<hi rend="sup">6</hi> of this county, loaded two flat boats at their landing above the city, and
                                    dropt down to this city where they completed their loading. The freight consisted of
                                    corn, hay, oats, bacon, etc. and was designed for a house in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                                    </placeName> that had advanced $2000, on the load. Our citizens, learning
                                    these facts, and hearing that the boats were ready to cut loose from their moorings,
                                    repaired to the river in a body and took off the oars, tied up the boats and told
                                    the Barbours that the boats must not be sent out. Their reply was that they would do
                                    as they pleased about the matter,—they had received $2000, on
                                    the load and were bound to make their contract good. In about ten days after this,
                                    in the dead of night the boats were cut loose, manned by three or four noted
                                    sympathizers of this city. The impression was created by this crew after their
                                    return that the boats were unloaded at <placeName>

                        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
                        <p>I think it highly important &amp; beneficial to Indiana and the adjoining States
                                    to address you thus—as a friend. It is well known to you that there is
                                    such a Society<hi rend="sup">8</hi> in Indiana as k.g.c. [Knights of the Golden
                                    Circle]. And to be plain &amp; honerable I wish to inform you that I have been a
                                    member of that order for about three months and having served in the capacity of an
                                    officer in the Central lodge of my County &amp; of course I have the opportunity
                                    of knowing all the important moves that is being or going to be made throughout all
                                    the different lodges in the State &amp; adjoining States.</p>
                        <p>Sir it will be putting my life at Stake to expose the Secret organization above
                                    mentioned, though I think that it is very important that it should be, for a proper
                                    exposition of this Secret order will keep down a rebellion among our people,
                                    although there will be some difficulty to overcome the attempts that is now being
                                    made, yet with proper information it can be done with more than usual Success. Now
                                    Sir if you feel disposed to act in good faith and will justify me for so doing I
                                    will furnish you with a written or verbal statement of all its proceedings from its

                                    for information belonging thereto by bringing things before the public in this
                                    manner, this Secret order like a ball in the air must fall. In order that full

                        <p>At a public meeting last nite, their speaker (Van Nocken) upheld Cecession, claimed
                                    brother-hood with armed traitors, openly denounced everything and everbody that were
                                    in favor of the Suppression of the Rebellion. And heaped the bitterest curses that
                                    his Hell deserving soul could rake up on the President and his Cabinet. In short it
                                    was well calculated to stimulate the ignorant Copperheads to acts of outrage of
                                    which they have already threatened. The treasonable speech was cheered by all
                                    present except Six [Union men].</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir, knowing that you must have a multiplicity of business on your mind I will
                                    detain you with only a few lines—</p>
                        <p>Seeing the condition of our Country, and the iminent danger to which the honest and
                                    Loyal citizen [s] of this State are Exposed on account of this <hi rend="i">Banditi
                                        of Unholy men</hi>; I allude to <hi rend="i">Knights of the Golden Circle</hi>,
                                    who are holding their night meetings throughout the length and breadth of the land.
                                    Evidently—I think to adopt plans, and ways, by which to greatly weaken if
                                    not, entirely frustrate, the movements of the Government, in the prosecution of this
                                    war—In a word they are rebels in heart and will be so in
                                    practice—very soon.</p>
                        <p>Unless they can be check'd immediately.—I would therefore
                                    recommend the propriety of enforcing Martial Law throughout the State, <hi rend="i">Immediately</hi>. I believe it would be a wise and proper movement also for the
                                    Governor to Issue a proclamation making it the duty of all the males over Eighteen
                                    and under 45 years to form themselves into companies, allowing older men the
                                    privilege of joining in with them, and all such companies to be put, under
                                    obligation to <hi rend="i">drill</hi> on Saturday afternoon of each week and to be
                                    called the <hi rend="i">home militia</hi>. Men who have had some practise in
                                    military tactics can be obtained in the country to drill such companies without
                                    calling home any from the regular army.</p>
                        <p>Then if Government Should find it necessary hereafter, to furnish such companies,
                                    with arms, it would be a great advantage to have men already drill'd who
                                    could go into action without farther delay. But I must close by advising you to keep
                                    a body guard of honest men, around your person. Please write to me soon if you can

                                    remember that we who still survive the fearful ravages of this wicked rebellion,
                                    whether we sided for or against the government, are at last, all brothers and

                                    associations to stay the hand of the executioner, and not to rest until you have it
                                    from the hands of the President a full and free pardon of these men. I know the
                                    aggravation to you is great but rise above all this and show to our countrymen that
                                    whilst victorious, you are more than generous; but let not a moment elapse, time is
                                    precious and a life once taken cannot be recalled. Do this Governor and whilst there

                                    and not only will your own conscience applaud but thousands of your fellow citizens
                                    will sing hosannas to you for being able to rise above party and personal feelings
                                    and thus save the lives of three persons who are reputed to have been your personal
                                    and political enemies. I will mention still further, that I am not personally
                                    acquainted with either of these parties condemned; but feel that there is no good to
                                    result to our country from their execution, and therefore ask your interposition in
                                    their favour, which I know if done settles it.</p>

                        arsenals in Indiana, a plot to lead an uprising of prisoners in coöperation with the
                        Confederates, and in other ways "giving aid and comfort to the enemy." The

                        return of peace. The evidence of the guilt of these men which had been accepted by a military

                                    the importance of the individuals involved.] Our last ground of opposition to Dr.
                                    Richard Owen<hi rend="sup">27</hi> is: He and his associates are as strong opponents
                                    of Republicanism as their capacities permit them to be; throughout the Presidential
                                    Campaign they have supported Douglas by the customary Democratic methods. Dr. R.
                                    Owen's conduct on January 5th will serve as a specimen. His brother, Robert
                                    Dale Owen,<hi rend="sup">28</hi> had called a meeting for the day. The Republicans
                                    attended in greater number than was expected, and it was known that the night
                                    before, the Republican Club of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, had declared against compromise. Dr. R. Owen made a passionate attack
                                    upon the Republicans; he told them that there were some present who were opposed to
                                    compromise, and that as the party favorable to compromise had paid the expenses of
                                    the room, those opposed to compromise had not anymore right to be present than
                                    infidels would have to be present at a church-meeting or Methodists at a Tom Paine
                                    celebration. Robert Dale Owen said he must oppose his brother for he had called the
                                    meeting and had urged all the inhabitants to attend.</p>
                        <p>When Dr. R. Owen spoke again, he poured out a rhapsody to the effect that
                                    amalgamation is the chief Republican principle, that mulattoes are tuberculous that
                                    Negroes are made to be used by the Anglo-Saxon race in hot climates, and that to
                                    prevent all the pestilential consequences of "amalgamation" they
                                    must be kept south of a certain line; not the line that suits the Republicans but
                                    the Crittenden line, or that line with his brother's modification.</p>

                    </placeName>, 1936. Pp. ix, 305, maps, $3.50.</head>
            <p>This valuable volume was "published from a fund contributed to the American Historical
                    Association by the Carnegie Corporation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>." It represents a new venture—an attempt to present and interpret
                    the post-frontier period of the Old Northwest. The descriptive sub-title indicates that the author
                    wished to include, in the history of the region and era selected, the "social, economic,
                    and political life and sectional tendencies before, during, and after the Civil War." This
                    he has done in an admirable effort, but he has made other phases of the life portrayed do service
                    mainly as the background of party history. Four of the fifteen chapters deal with social
                    development, culture, and business conditions, but the remaining chapters are primarily political.</p>
            <p>The headings of the sections, into which the chapters are divided, reveal correctly the trend of the
                    author's thought in regard to party activities and leaders. "The Progressive
                    Western Democracy, 184–848"; "Popular Sovereignty Becomes Popular";
                    "Lincoln and Douglas Not Far Apart in the Great Debate"; "The Lower South Breaks
                    from the Douglas West"; "The Lakes and the East Reluctantly Accept Lincoln"; "The
                    Free West Repudiates Lincoln, 1862"; "The Western Peace Bolt, 1864"; "The Revival
                    of the Democratic Party in the West, 186–872"—these titles, selected from the
                    headings of sections scattered through the book, will help readers of this review, who may be
                    interested, to know what to expect from a study of Professor Hubbart's volume. There are
                    numerous fresh points of view in regard to leaders, events and movements, some of which are original
                    and some of which have been adopted by the author, that lend interest to his treatment. He has had
                    no tendency to accept stereotyped interpretations without at least a new and critical examination.</p>
            <p>It seems unfortunate that the title of the volume should indicate that it covers the period from
                    "1840 to 1880quot;. A more fitting range would be 1840 to 1870, or certainly not a longer
                    period than from 1840 to 1875. When mentioning the <placeName>

                    that "Indiana was rewarded and the West supposedly appeased by the nomination of Hendricks
                    as the vice-presidential Candidate" (p. 247). "The Old North-West in the
                    Post-Frontier Period" would seem to fit the book better than to include the term
                    "Middle West" in the title, but the author makes clear to what country he means
                    his title to apply.</p>
            <p>It remains to say that Professor Hubbart has written an excellent book which is based on extensive
                    research and which represents an open-minded approach to the problems of the times. All who are
                    interested in Indiana history will find a great deal of important matter in this study that bears
                    directly on the state's development in the period covered. The remainder of the contents of
                    the volume apply to the geographic section of which Indiana is a part, and cannot be other than
                    attractive to citizens of the Hoosier commonwealth.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Indiana Asbury-DePauw University, 188–937</hi>. By William Warren Sweet.
                    The Abingdon Press, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Pp. 298, illustrated.</head>
            <p>It would have been difficult to find another person as well fitted to write a centennial history of
                    DePauw University as Dr. Sweet of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Vitally interested in DePauw, sometime professor of history in that institution, a
                    writer of history, he seems to have been just the man to prepare the work. The resulting volume is
                    an adequate testimonial that he measured up to the task that he undertook.</p>
            <p>The history of any college that has lived a hundred years should be interesting and colorful.
                    Unfortunately too many such histories consist of a series of biographical sketches of the presidents
                    with a modest amount of other matter thrown in for padding. Dr. Sweet has dealt adequately with the
                    strong men who guided the destiny of DePauw through one hundred years, but he has not slighted other
                    features of college life. Financial problems, the work and influence of faculty <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-033-1-083"/> members, student activities, both academic and extra-curricular, and
                    the general policy and growth of the institution—all these are skillfully woven into the
                    narrative.</p>
            <p>Like most colleges, DePauw has passed through some serious crises, one of the most interesting being
                    the abolition of the Normal School in 1890. At this time, the total enrollment of the institution
                    passed above 1,000, but those enrolled in the College of Liberal Arts made up less than a third of
                    the student body. The Preparatory School was as yet very <hi rend="i">large, while the Normal
                        School, a division of the University</hi>, cared for a group of students more than half as
                    numerous as those enrolled in the College of Liberal Arts. Early in his administration, Pres. J. P.
                    D. John consummated the elimination of the teachers' department, with the backing of the
                    Board of Trustees. This move was not well understood at the time, but most professors of content
                    subjects in Universities today will agree with a later president of DePauw, now Bishop Edwin Holt
                    Hughes, that President John did well when he kept "the Normal School from oversloughing the
                    University."</p>
            <p>One might wish that Dr. Sweet had written more in regard to the outstanding men and women educated at
                    DePauw University during the century. In that long period many students have come to sit at the feet
                    of the teachers of the institution, for a comparatively brief time at best, but, on a large number,
                    a deep impression was undoubtedly made by professors and by the general college life and spirit.
                    Just as a tree is known by its fruits, so a college must be known by its products. These are
                    contributions to scholarship, and the graduates turned out. There is, of course, a good reason why,
                    even in an excellent college history, not a great deal can be said of the alumni. It is hard to know
                    how much the college period has to do with the success of a graduate, with his attainments, or with
                    his services to society. It is not the contention of the reviewer that this difficulty can be
                    overcome, but rather he is expressing the wish that more could be known in regard to how much that
                    is worth while in the lives of the graduates of a college should be credited to the college
                    influence.</p>
            <p>In closing this appraisal, the statements cannot be omitted that every one with a special interest in
                    DePauw University owes a debt to Dr. Sweet; and that everyone interested <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-033-1-084"/> in the development of mid-western colleges will profit by reading this
                    newest history of a strong Indiana College—the erstwhile Indiana Asbury University, now
                    DePauw University.</p>

               </placeName>, where the family
                    remained till 1842. During the last years of his life, Osborn was engaged in farming and lived in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana.</p>
            <p>In his early years, Osborn was not interested in anti-slavery activities, but as the years went by he
                    became more and more hostile to the institution. While he moved slowly from one position to another,
                    Miss Ketring states that "he was one of the few leaders who bridged the gap from the early
                    and moderate anti-slavery movement in the South to the rabid campaigns of the northern
                    abolitionists" (p. 85).</p>
            <p>In 1815, a manumission society was formed in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, for which Osborn was "chiefly responsiblequot;. At no time afterwards, it
                    seems, did he act so openly against slavery. He established the <hi rend="i">Philanthropist</hi> at
                    Mount Pleasant, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, in 1817. This paper, of which there is a complete file
                    in the Indiana State Library, he edited and published for more than a year. It was in the same
                    county that Benjamin Lundy had organized <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s first anti-slavery society in 1815. The <hi rend="i">Philanthropist</hi>,
                    though it has such a reputation, was really not a strong anti-slavery organ. The editor did not,
                    through its columns, advocate "immediate and <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-033-1-085"/>
                    unconditional emancipation" (p. 35). He did oppose the American Colonization Society, and
                    the attacks of the <hi rend="i">Philanthropist</hi> on this organization, probably represent
                    Osborn's "most advanced thought" relative to slavery, in so far as his
                    views were published. While editor of the <hi rend="i">Philanthropist</hi>, Osborn became acquainted
                    with Benjamin Lundy who, for a short time, selected the "exchange" articles and
                    items that appeared in Osborn's paper. Lundy was prevented from becoming a partner of
                    Osborn by a sojourn in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> at the time of the contest over admission to the Union. Osborn sold his paper to Elisha
                    Bates, and Lundy established the <hi rend="i">Genius of Universal Emancipation</hi> as a rival to
                    the <hi rend="i">Philanthropist</hi> in the same town in 1821. Osborn's chief work against
                    slavery during the rest of his life (181–850) was done in connection with the Society of
                    Friends. "There it was," writes Miss Ketring, "that his words as a
                    minister of twenty-five or thirty years experience carried weight. There it was that he lost no
                    opportunity to preach or speak in behalf of the slave. Those exhortations are now lost forever, and
                    they alone would show the true extent of his labors in the cause" (p. 86).</p>

            <p>I finished high school in the spring of 1888.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In the fall of 1890, I began my
                    teaching career. In the interval, which seems very long as I look back to it in retrospect, I
                    worried a great deal about the future. Wandering on a barren plateau, with no signs to guide me, I
                    was much disturbed at times. Long ago, however, I ceased to regret having passed through that
                    discouraging period, having become certain that the experience was valuable. There was at least time
                    to think. Before leaving high school, I had been led to consider the possibility of entering <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College. A woman who was interested in boys told me that she had talked to Dr.
                        Tuttle<hi rend="sup">2</hi> about me, which furnished something to dream about. There was a
                    feeling in our home that I ought to go to college, if possible to provide a way.</p>
            <p>Before any headway had been made to carry out any sort of plan, a prosperous relative came to our
                    home for a brief visit. After his departure, I learned that he had convinced my parents that the
                    surest road to success for me could be found through giving me a short course in a business college.
                    In addition, he had volunteered to loan $100 for the purpose, which he thought might be
                    sufficient to pay tuition board and room-rent for three months. He had known, or heard of, some
                    young persons who had learned enough about bookkeeping in about twelve weeks to obtain jobs.</p>
            <p>A few college catalogues had been sent to me just before my high school commencement. There was one
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College, one from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College and one from the State Normal School at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Besides these three from schools of which I had heard, there was another, the annual
                    catalogue of the American Normal College.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> It was the plan <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In the four Issues of 1936, there appeared four installments of what
                            was called "The Beginnings of a Possible Autobiography." In these, the
                            story of my life, to the time of graduation from high school, was briefly told. In the four
                            issues of 1937, the plan is to carry the autobiography through another period of years,
                            possibly to the year 1908.—<hi rend="i">Editor</hi>.</item>

                            was Miss Rachel Crawford, a teacher in the Delphi schools, and teacher of my Sunday School

                            or DePauw University. This seems a small matter, but there is a strong chance that I might
                            have entered Indiana University in 1891 instead of the State Normal School, had I received a
                            catalogue from the University in 1888 as I did from the Normal School.</item>

                    </placeName>, but, if so, I must wait until September. The American Normal College was open
                    throughout the year, so the catalogue declared, and students could enter at any time. There was a
                    teachers' course, a music course, and, what intrigued me at the moment, a business course.
                    The regular terms were ten weeks each, but a short term of four weeks was to start in mid-summer.
                    For this short term, the cost for room, board and tuition was to be $25. At the end of
                    this term, one could go on without a break into the next term. This seemed to be exactly the chance
                    for which we were looking. As it would surely be possible to prepare for a career as an accountant
                    and business man in fourteen weeks, the cost of my education would not run beyond the
                    $100 which was in sight.</p>
            <p>The American Normal College was in <placeName>

                    </placeName> which was but little farther from our farm in one direction than was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the other. Preparations were soon completed, and I left Delphi for college on Monday
                    morning, July 23, 1888. The distance was soon covered on a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Railway train, and I was in the office of President Charles E. Kircher by the middle of
                    the forenoon. I immediately learned that the last ten-weeks term of the year was just closing, and
                    that the new short term would not begin till the following Monday. It did not seem best to return to
                    my home for a week, so I decided to take the advice of the President and get used to the place while
                    waiting for class work to begin. I was temporarily assigned to a room on the third floor, which I
                    was to share with a young man who had been on the scene for some time. The dining-room was in the
                    basement. In fact, everything was provided under one roof at this institution of learning. I mean
                    rooms, meals, and instruction, for, to get water, one must go out of the building and part way down
                    the hill.</p>
            <p>My stay at the American Normal College was not extended. Though without experience, a few hours
                    convinced me that the conditions at this temple of learning were not satisfactory, and I planned my
                    departure. I made my get-away on Wednesday afternoon. A bit later in the summer, I read an item in.
                    one of the Delphi papers, which recorded the closing of the institution. This was before the end of
                    the four weeks term, during which I was to have received the first portion of my business training.</p>
            <p>I recall that the annual commencement exercises were <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-033-1-089"/> about to
                    take place on Thursday or Friday, but I left a day or two too soon. It was because of this annual
                    event that classes were not meeting that week. Students were not returning to their homes, though
                    class-work was suspended and many of them were not planning to remain in school. The explanation is
                    that having paid their bills in advance, they could remain to the end of the week without extra
                    cost. Indeed they must remain to get all that was coming to them. There must have been from one
                    hundred to one hundred fifty students. There were the two proverbial literary societies, and the
                    members of each were extremely active and loyal. A near riot occurred in the early afternoon of my
                    first day, over a prospective member that each society was determined to land. I am sure of this, as
                    I was that prospective member and the innocent cause of the trouble.</p>
            <p>The name of the man in charge of the college dining hall was Joe Roop, I believe. All of the students
                    dined at the same time, morning, noon, and evening. I partook of Joe's fare seven times.
                    The charge was not great—eighty-four cents, according to my memory. Possibly it was a
                    little more or a little less. I can not recall the two breakfasts, but, at each of the other five
                    meals, potatoes and chicken gravy, but no chicken, were served. At noon on my last day, I asked a
                    young man who was dining with me (John Guthrie, whom I learned to know quite well in later years)
                    how it was possible to have chicken gravy so often with no tangible basis for the dish. His answer
                    was: "Oh, that's easy. Joe just hangs a rooster in the window and lets the shadow
                    fall in the pot."</p>
            <p>During the long afternoon of my first day, I passed through an hour of great mental anguish. I seemed
                    to be slated for a considerable period at the American Normal College, and I felt that I could not
                    go through with it. Seated alone on the hillside in my agony, it finally occurred to me to write to
                    my father and ask his permission to return home. This done, I felt better and soon I was able to see
                    the humor in the situation. My courage was greatly aided by the knowledge that I had not paid the
                    $25 fee covering all expenses for the four weeks term. This good fortune was due to no
                    wisdom or foresight on my part. I was very anxious to pay over the amount when I first visited the
                    President's office, and the school undoubtedly needed the cash. It was not time to collect
                    fees for the new term, however, so I was not given an opportunity to <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-033-1-090"/> pay the term bill a week in advance.</p>
            <p>By Wednesday morning, I was able to reflect that my letter might not be received at home for several
                    days. All would depend on whether my father should happen to make a trip to Delphi, as there was no
                    rural delivery then. It would be best to go home and make my explanations in person. I laid my plans
                    carefully, as I did not want anything to interfere with my decision. I went to Joe Roop and paid my
                    bills, and then packed my trunk, which Guthrie helped me to carry down to the street when no one was
                    looking. I had gone down town and engaged a drayman to come at one o'clock. When I arrived
                    in Delphi, I found my father there. He had come to town for some purpose, had received my letter,
                    and had attempted to reach me by phone at the College to tell me that I should return forthwith to
                    the parental roof. He was a bit puzzled that I could not be found, but encountered me in person soon
                    after his failure to contact me by long distance, and soon learned that all was well with me.</p>
            <p>I think that President Charles E. Kircher was a good man who was doing his best to operate a school
                    on slender resources in competition with larger and more successful institutions of a similar kind

                    Presbyterian pastor in charge of a church somewhere in Indiana, and was brought to <placeName>

                    the time, I was a member of that church, but I did not remind the "candidate", as
                    one who preaches a trial sermon is generally called, that I had once met him, when a would-be
                    student, in the President's Office of the American Normal College.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                            was to bear the name of "Smithson College." Smithson was an Englishman who
                            migrated to the <placeName>

                            amount to the Smithson College fund. The building was erected in 187–. It was
                            destroyed by fire not long after 1890. The Smithsons were Universalists who desired to see a

                    considerable business acumen, who showed a good deal of culture. I liked him and believe that he
                    developed quite a friendship for me, though I was called to his office several times on account of
                    activities that I should not have engaged in.</p>
            <p>The tuition for three months was $27, but I remained through four months paying a pro-rata
                    fee for the extra month. I found room and board with a family on North Fourth Street, about four
                    blocks from the Courthouse. This cost me four dollars per week. Four other students from the
                    Business College roomed and boarded at the same place. Two of these students were as young as I,
                    another was about five years older, and the fifth was about ten years my senior.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> These colleagues were conscientious, working students, each of whom set me a good example.
                    We became thoroughly acquainted and several strong friendships were formed. Not the least of our
                    pleasant associations were our meetings around the dining-table. Mrs. Garrett provided fairly good
                    meals, which we enjoyed, but we derived much pleasure as well from the conversation in which we
                    indulged. A number of times later, I boarded with larger groups of college students who met three
                    times a day about the same table. I am sure that there is, in these days of the college commons, and
                    numerous small "eating joints" (where food is served at all hours), a loss of
                    something of real value, that, in a former period, was always an accompaniment of the college
                    boarding club.</p>
            <p>There were about eighty students in the Union Business College when I was there and only two regular
                    instructors. Principal Robinson directed the work in bookkeeping and taught penmanship. There were
                    occasional recitations of the different groups who were learning to keep books, but most of the work
                    was individual. There was a daily writing period in the large room and most of the students made
                    real progress. The other instructor was a middle-aged school teacher who had been brought in from a
                    country district to teach commercial arithmetic and spelling. He was well-meaning and kind, but his
                    mind worked slowly and his methods were wooden. He could, of course, pronounce the words from the

                    of the problems in arithmetic he could not solve. After a few weeks, I dropped both the spelling and
                    the arithmetic and gave more time to penmanship and bookkeeping. The teacher spoke to me about it,
                    but I did not take them up again. The matter was mentioned to me no more. If brought to the
                    attention of the Principal, he said nothing about it. I was only a boy of eighteen and I should have
                    been more docile, but I am still certain that I was well in advance of Mr. O. in both arithmetic and
                    spelling. Stenography and typewriting were also listed as optional subjects, but I believe that less
                    than ten students were enrolled in these courses. They were taught by a part-time instructor who
                    probably had a position with some business or professional firm.</p>
            <p>The student body was made up of persons who ranged in age from about fourteen to thirty. Some were
                    children who had lost interest or failed in the public schools. Others were country school teachers
                    who had been led to believe that a business course would open the doors to success in the commercial
                    world. Still others were high school graduates, who, like myself, believed that there were good jobs
                    ahead as bookkeepers for those who would apply themselves and make the brief but necessary
                        preparation.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>At the end of four months, I went back to the farm, where there was always work to be done and where
                    board and lodging were free. For about a year, I continued to expect a job, but none came. I was
                    disappointed and discouraged. I was out of touch with the business world. I had few contacts with
                    anyone who might have employed me in any capacity, even in our small county seat or in the villages
                    where I had some acquaintances. If I could have started as a delivery clerk, or in some equally
                    responsible "position", I might have worked up to something, and, along the way,
                    my slight acquaintance with ledgers and balance sheets might have helped me. As it was, I had been
                    filled with the idea that I surely would obtain a job as a bookkeeper within a reasonable time,
                    though under the circumstances this was really out of the question.</p>

                    in touch with persons wanting a bookkeeper. It was not long until a notice came that I should apply
                    for a position with Washmeyer, Hartley &amp; Raub, a firm located somewhere in Indian Territory.
                    I made my first formal application for a job, following carefully all the rules that had been
                    recommended to me. After waiting restlessly for about two weeks, I received a reply from a Mr.
                    Richter, of Hartley &amp; Richter, successors to Washmeyer, Hartley &amp; Raub. The vacancy
                    had been filled before the receipt of my application, the place going to a young man from some town

                    </placeName> to settlement.</p>
            <p>Spring and summer went by, while I marked time by working steadily on the farm. During these slow
                    passing months, or, to be more specific, on March 1, 1889, a Mr. Demas Simpson Thomas, who had
                    purchased the farm adjoining ours on the south, moved into the neighborhood. The family consisted of
                    himself, his wife and one daughter. The daughter, then almost fifteen years of age, was destined to
                    play a large part in my life as she became my wife several years later.</p>
            <p>In this period, while the belief that I must crash into the business world still possessed my spirit,
                    I met a young man, older than myself, who gave me a new idea. He had gone to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> twice, where he was able to find work in some store each time, merely by
                    "running his facequot;. He recommended this easy method to me. I failed to ask him why he
                    was not still in the great city adding one success to another, but, though superficial, my adviser
                    was suave and fluent and could readily have given a plausible explanation. I incubated the idea for
                    a long time, and then found an opportunity to try it out. An excursion to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was advertised by the Monon Railway for a Wednesday early in September. The round-trip
                    fare from Delphi was $1.50. The special train would reach <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> at about eleven A.M., and return at night. My plan was to buy a round-trip ticket, but
                    not to come back, in order to save $1.85 on the regular one way fare. I made my
                    preparations <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-033-1-094"/> which included the purchase of a fair-sized valise.
                    It was made of dark gray canvas-cloth decorated with plenty of tan leather in addition to the
                    straps. It looked well, but I felt that I should carry along some ledgers, journals and daybooks
                    that I had worked through and my bookkeeping text, which added too much weight.</p>
            <p>Soon after my arrival in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a slow rain began to fall. I bought an umbrella. It did not cost much, and it looked
                    quite neat before it was opened up. I soon discovered that it was a real family umbrella, which,
                    after the first use, always looked like those of Uncle Josh that are shown in cartoons in spite of
                    anything that I could do to it. I engaged a room in a small, clean, well managed hotel on State
                    Street for which I paid fifty cents a day. I was able to get my meals at surprisingly low prices at
                    various convenient restaurants. If I could just find a job, all would be well. I took the precaution
                    on my second day to put away in a separate pocket $3.35, the fare to Delphi. On Thursday
                    and Friday, I went to many parts of the City, using the street-cars. I bought newspapers and
                    answered want-ads. I called at several places to ask for work. I wrote several letters home, not one
                    of which was received until after my return. I held out until Saturday night, living on five cents
                    worth of buns the last day. It was quite an experience for a nineteen-year old youth, and there were
                    no regrets except in regard to the position that I did not find.</p>
            <p>My train left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> at 8:30 P.M. and reached Delphi at 12:30 A.M. I was again in familiar territory, but I
                    was a bit over four miles from home with a heavy valise, a large umbrella (strapped on the side of
                    said valise), and I had eaten nothing save six light buns since Friday. Nevertheless, I started on
                    the long walk with no misgivings. When I was nearly half way home, I looked back and saw a man
                    walking in my direction nearly a quarter of a mile behind me. I decided to out-walk him, but he
                    constantly gained on me though I did my best. I detached my umbrella, for use in case of necessity,
                    and slowed down. When this pedestrian came near, I found that he was a middle-aged, unmarried
                    carpenter, who lived with a family in our neighborhood. Possibly he slackened his pace, but I think
                    not. At any rate, I did not fall behind during the remainder of that walk.</p>
            <p>From the time of my return until the Christmas holidays, I hauled gravel, hauled cordwood, husked
                    corn, helped work <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-033-1-095"/> a cross-cut saw, and did many other jobs that
                    farm life can furnish in fall and winter.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> January found me occupying a seat in
                    the country school where I had been a pupil before entering high school. My object was to review all
                    the "common branches" and then take the teacher's examination in an
                    attempt to obtain a license. In that period, the only requirements to be met before becoming a
                    teacher were: the possession of a license; the attainment of the proper age; "good moral
                    character"; and a contract with a Township Trustee or School Board. I stayed in school six weeks,

                    during the early part of the term and what they would study in the latter part of the term, after
                    the date when I planned to withdraw. I went to the county seat and wrote on the February list of
                    State Board questions. As a result I was granted a twelve-months license.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> I did
                    not obtain a school before the opening of the term in September, but, after about a month had
                    passed, the teacher of the home school was shifted to a district northeast of Delphi and I was
                    placed in charge of about forty-five pupils with all the grades from the chart class to those who
                    would finish the eighth grade in the spring of 1891.</p>
            <p>Having concluded my review work at the end of February, I went back to farm activities, to which I
                    devoted my time until about July 1. Then I began to work at a small factory which produced draintile
                    of varying sizes from three to ten inches in diameter. The tile factory had been established in
                    1886, less than a quarter of a mile from our home, but on the opposite side of the highway. In the
                    spring of 1890, the business changed hands and the new proprietor, who was a tile manufacturer of <placeName>

                    man from South Delphi. After a few months, one of the laborers left his job. I was taken on as a
                    temporary hand, so I <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi> In this period, I tried to get started in the business of
                            selling' electric belts at $3.00 each. To begin, I must buy two belts at
                            half price, persuade two persons with back trouble to wear them, and obtain a testimonial
                            from each. After that, I was to be given a virgin territory, when great success was sure to
                            come to me provided I should show the requisite energy and business ability. To make the
                            story brief, this venture did not work out in accordance with what was outlined in the
                            literature sent me. I purchased the two belts, found two elderly persons to use them,
                            obtained the testimonials, made no sales, and surrendered the job with all of its
                            possibilities at the end of a few weeks.</item>

                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi> The regular common school licenses were issued for six months,
                            twelve months, twenty-four months, and thirty-six months. The grade of license issued,
                            depended on the average of grades in all the subjects included, and on the lowest grade made
                            by the applicant in any subject. The subjects covered by the examination questions were:
                            writing, spelling, history, physiology, grammar, geography, arithmetic, reading and science
                            of education. The County Superintendent graded the manuscripts.</item>

                    One man hauled dirt from the pit; another shoveled this dirt, after treating it with a prescribed
                    amount of water, into the hopper of the mill (called "filling the gum"); a third
                    man cut the tile with a revolving frame across which steel wires were stretched at regular
                    intervals. The "off-bearer" had merely to grasp the frame and bring it down firmly
                    and quickly to cut off four tiles from the tube of moist, moulded earth. He set the
                    "green" tile on a flat car, which when loaded was pushed back into a long shed by
                    the fourth man, who replaced the filled car with an empty one. I was the fourth laborer. It was my
                    duty to set the newly made tile on strips of wood, in one after another of the many stalls in the
                    long drying shed. The small sizes were easy to put in place, but the larger tiles required expert
                    handling.</p>
            <p>The fifth man on the force operated the steam-engine which furnished the power for the mill and for
                    the water-pump. The sixth man cared for the kiln in which the tile were burned. When tile were
                    properly finished and cooled, the entire force worked together to empty the kiln and rick the tile
                    on the yard. Likewise, the entire gang worked together to refill the kiln. I labored at this factory
                    for three months. My wages were seventy-five cents per day and meals. One member of the force became
                    ill and died during August, and still later another left for his home in <placeName>

                    </placeName> because of a temporary sickness. New men were picked up to fill these vacancies, one of
                    whom was beyond sixty years of age. He had for many years owned an elevator (warehouse) in Delphi.
                    He had also carried on a sort of private banking business. For many years he had been a more or less
                    successful buyer and seller of futures in connection with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Board of Trade. Now, his job was to shovel dirt into the hopper of the mill. This he
                    did day after day without complaint. One day when engine trouble caused a halt for a time, this
                    dapper, little gentleman, with a neatly trimmed full-beard, a pleasant voice, and an excellent
                    command of English, told several of us some interesting facts. "The most money I ever made
                    in one day was $3,000", he remarked. "The most I ever lost in one day
                    was $9,000quot;. He believed that his failure in business was due not to working the
                    Board of Trade, but to working it too steadily. He was not bitter. He did not want any sympathy. He
                    went along working very cheerfully for seventy-five cents <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-033-1-097"/> a day
                    and board. It is a pleasure to record that some of his old friends were able after a few weeks to

            <p>There were no regular pay-days in connection with the little manufacturing institution for which I
                    worked. Workmen were paid such sums as it seemed absolutely necessary for them to have, from two to
                    three weeks after their requests were made. We lived simple lives, and, receiving board and room,
                    not much cash was required. I spent my nights at home, and usually got my breakfast there except
                    when I was detailed to cook for the factory force. I do not remember the exact amount, but am sure
                    that I was ahead as much as thirty dollars when I quit my job. The proprietor settled with all the
                    employes soon after I severed my connections with his factory. I did not begin my teaching career
                    with money in the bank, but I did have a few dollars in my pocket. I was a young man of twenty when
                    I took charge of the country school in the neighborhood where I was born and where I grew up. I did
                    not accept the job because I felt a "call" to the work, but because there seemed
                    to be no other chance to get a start in life.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> My conscience still hurts me for
                    imposing myself on that room-full of young hopefuls, but, like thousands of other young men, I had
                    to find myself, and used the public schools as the means to that end.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>The correlation of history and genealogy is so obvious that to call attention to it, other than for
                    the sake of emphasis, is as superfluous as carrying coals to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newcastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The history of a locality is bound up with the lives of its people. The branches of a
                    family tree are intertwined with an accumulated growth of history.</p>
            <p>Genealogy, <hi rend="i">per se</hi>, might soon die of its own boredom. If its pursuit led along a
                    dusty road only to the finding of some links in a family chain, there would be justification for
                    that attitude of antipathy which many people hold toward the word <hi rend="i">genealogy</hi>. But
                    genealogy is more than this. It is a portrayal of the drama of life through succeeding epochs of
                    history. Rather, it is an entire literature of life, for its byways and lanes lead into romance and
                    poetry, tragedy and much comedy, biography and history. This is what gives to the quest for an
                    ancestry that fascination from which the devotee cannot and does not care to free himself.</p>
            <p>The genealogical importance of a state is determined largely by three rather inter-dependent
                    factors—namely, geographical position, age, and the character of its record. That section
                    of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> which is now recognized as Indiana, has always benefited, both from migrations and
                    other forces, from being on the line of march. The territorial years, plus almost a century and a
                    quarter of statehood, have built up for Indiana an established place in history. Position and age,
                    with some unusual contributory influences, have combined to make of that history and its attendant
                    genealogy a record worthy of investigation.</p>
            <p>Indiana is becoming more and more a fertile field for genealogical research. Its records are being
                    sought not only by its own people" but by those of other states with Indiana connections.
                    For this reason, an additional source of information becomes of widespread interest. The news of the
                    inauguration of a section in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> to be devoted to
                    Indiana Genealogy and to be conducted by Mrs. Harvey Morris of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, spread with almost the swiftness of telepathy. That the section takes on the
                    nature of a tribunal before which one can lay his case, causes even greater <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-033-1-104"/> rejoicing. Its auspicious start and its enthusiastic reception augur
                    well for its future, and it is both hoped and urged that through interest of its patrons and
                    additional subscriptions to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, the section will receive the support
                    necessary for its continuance.</p>
            <p>While there is no official connection between the Genealogy Section of the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi> and the Genealogy Section of the Indiana State Library, it is purposed
                    that the two shall co-operate to the extent of a mutual helpfulness. Their very differences and
                    distinctions should work toward successful results. It can readily be seen that the Section in the
                        <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> will fulfill a long-felt need which the Library Section cannot meet,
                    for the latter does not undertake the research necessary to the supplying of links in a family
                    history. Its purpose is to answer the very definite requests which can be handled through indices
                    and readily available guides, to direct in the use of the material in the Library, and to suggest,
                    whenever possible, sources where information may be found. Since no material circulates from the
                    Genealogical Section of the State Library, the disadvantage to that patron who cannot visit the
                    Library in person, is met with a limited amount of copying and with a somewhat greater effort to put
                    this patron in touch with the material in the library. The actual work of research is to be done by
                    the person in quest of facts, or by that one, not connected with the Library staff, whom he may
                    choose to carry on the investigation.</p>
            <p>An extensive system of indexing is in progress under the direction of Miss Leona Tobey, assistant in
                    the genealogy room. This will be a constantly increasing aid to both patron and librarian in
                    promoting accessibility of records. Already the genealogy catalog, which is supplementary to the
                    main catalog of the State Library, contains the lists of family and local histories and many
                    analytical references. Several indexing projects are in process, the chief one being the
                    alphabetizing on cards of the names of heads of families as found in the photostat copies of the
                    Indiana census records for 1820 and 1830. While the work on many of the counties of the 1820 record
                    is finished and the cards filed, it will be some months before the entire list is complete. The
                    Society of Indiana Pioneers and the Indiana Historical Society have aided materially in
                    contributions for the thousands of cards necessary <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-033-1-105"/> for the
                    project. Other important records are being indexed, in some cases the service of patrons being
                    offered gratis and accepted gratefully. Mrs. J. M. Hopkins, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is indexing the scrapbooks containing the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Transcript</hi> clippings. Mr. Willard E. Wight, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has already finished an alphabetical list of names of Indiana Pensioners in the 1835
                    pension roll, and has begun work on the rolls of other states.</p>
            <p>The editor of the Genealogy Section of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> has kindly offered occasional
                    space for lists of material and other items from the Library which may tend to keep the two sections
                    in close relationship. Both sections are new, the Library Section having been opened to the public
                    March 1, 1934. Up to that time the work had been carried on by the Reference and Indiana History
                    Divisions of the library. But so well were the foundations laid during the years of the
                    Library's existence, both as to material and methods of work and the later cataloging of
                    the separated collection, that the first librarian of the new section found the way already paved.</p>
            <p>It is impossible at this time to do more than suggest the nature of the material which is being added
                    to the Library. More detailed lists. will appear later. The request that the people of Indiana make
                    the Library a depository for their family histories is meeting with a liberal response and should be
                    kept in mind. Many of these histories in manuscript, pamphlet, chart, and book form are being
                    received. Local histories and miscellaneous material have been acquired through donations and
                    through purchase. Sets, which may be difficult to obtain later on, are receiving especial attention,
                    such as, for instance, the volumes of the <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Historical Gazetteer</hi>. The publications of the Harleain Society of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, comprising parish registers and visitations of the heralds will help in standardizing
                    the collection in the genealogy room. Strassburger's volumes on the <hi rend="i">

                    reception. The library is fortunate in having the seven collections on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> history covered by the new two-volume <hi rend="i">

                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                        </placeName> Historical Index</hi>, which contains over twenty-two hundred pages of references.</p>
            <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-033-1-106"/>
            <p>The coöperation of the patriotic and historical societies in Indiana leaves little to be
                    desired. The Indiana Society of Mayflower Descendants has deposited its entire collection here, thus
                    putting it at the disposal of patrons using the library. The Society of Colonial Wars has done
                    likewise. The Society of Colonial Dames is placing its memorial volumes here. The Daughters of
                    Founders and Patriots have given lineage books and separate volumes. The Daughters of the American
                    Revolution continue to place in the library one copy of each of the genealogical records compiled by
                    the various chapters in the state. Gifts have been received from the Sons of the American
                    Revolution, the Children of the American Revolution, and Daughters of 1812. Noteworthy among
                    cemetery records are those of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Ripley County</region>
                    </placeName>, compiled by Miss Violet E. Toph of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Mr. Harry O. Carman of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the work having been done under the auspices of the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
            <p>The Genealogy Section of the Indiana State Library, being the older of the two sections, extends the
                    right hand of fellowship to the Genealogy Section of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History</hi>, and congratulates it on its opportunity and ability not only to furnish much needed
                    information but to become a real force in focusing attention on Indiana genealogy and to help in
                    keeping Indiana in pace with other states that are meeting the "wave of genealogy"
                    which sweeps the country. May the new Section live long and prosper.</p>

            <p>Strangeman Hutchins was a very prominent member of the Friend's Church. There was a small
                    meeting at Genito Creek, but his principal activity was at the great central meeting at Cedar Creek,

                    </placeName>, his name is continually on the records as a witness, as a member of committees, as a
                    representative, as an overseer, as a clerk, as an elder. As one reads between the lines of the
                    record, he realizes that Strangeman Hutchins, was a man of amazing vitality and remarkable ability.</p>
            <p>Strangeman Hutchins was sixty-eight years old when the Revolutionary War began, and seventy-three by

                    mentioned in Query 13, who married Bluford G. Davis (second wife), may possibly belong to this
                    Edwards family, and, if so, she may be able to assist those doing research on the Davis

            <p>The Bible records of the Vandivier family as here reprinted are from a collection of records of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, a set of six volumes compiled by the Alexander Hamilton Chapter, Daughters of
                    the American Revolution, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. The work was begun in 1930, during the regency of Mrs. William H. Schlasser,
                    and the last volume was completed about five years later. Volume I is a miscellaneous collection
                    consisting of abstracts of early wills of the County, early land grants, histories of schools,
                    churches and other organizations. Finally, there is a list of names of Revolutionary soldiers buried

            <p>Two of the volumes are made up of marriage records from the beginning of the county court records to
                    and including 1900. These records were copied by Edna Thompson Bice and are indexed. Another volume
                    is devoted to cemetery records, covering every cemetery, both large and small, in the County. This
                    volume was the work of Ruth Trout Hougham. There are two volumes of Bible and genealogical records
                    of pioneer families of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>

                    records that follow.</p>
