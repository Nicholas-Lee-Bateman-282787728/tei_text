                    experienced in frontier life to underestimate its demands.</p>
            <p>Perhaps he was tired of the little <placeName>

                    settled there in 1793 as agent for the trading house of Todd and Hay.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> One of

                    Since more of Cahokia's five hundred inhabitants were French than English, it was a great
                    advantage to be bilingual. The fact probably helped Hays to secure his appointment as sheriff of <placeName>

            <p>When the firm of Todd and Hay dissolved, Hays was sufficiently established to go into business for
                    himself, or rather into several businesses. Part of the time he had goods for sale in the village.
                    Every autumn he went or sent a boat far up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> with goods for the Indian trade.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> These expeditions covered months,
                    sometimes all winter; during the summers he devoted himself to farming in the rich bottomlands near
                    Cahokia.</p>
            <p>In all these occupations, public and private, Hays showed good judgment and an ability to get along
                    in the world. His marriage followed the same estimable pattern, if we are to believe his townsman
                    John Reynolds, who says somewhat sententiously that Hays "married a lady in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, of excellent family, and what is still better, of sound, good sense. They lived
                    together in Cahokia, and raised a respectable family."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1814, Hays became collector of internal revenue for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Territory.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> This did not add appreciably to his income, but it did
                    widen his political acquaintance and strengthen his reputation as a good public servant. About this
                    time Cahokia's century-old glories began to fade, and it sank gradually to the status of a
                    slack river town, noted only for the roistering weekly balls of its French-Canadian <hi rend="i">voyageurs.</hi> By 1820 the occasional travelers through the area spoke of Cahokia with pity or
                    distaste. One of them dispatched the town in a single scathing sentence. "At two
                    o'clock," he wrote, "we entered and passed through the village of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

            <p>Hays saw his business declining with the town. Being a practical man, he began to look for something
                    better. A land-office post—a fairly sedentary employment—would have suited him
                    exactly, and it is likely that he asked the aid of his political friends in securing one. What
                    actually came his way was the offer of the Indian agency at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, hundreds of miles away in the Indiana wilderness.</p>
            <p>We can imagine him meeting the post rider on a hot June day and fishing from the mailbag a red-sealed
                    letter addressed to himself.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> "Department of War, 24 May,
                    1820," began the neat script. "Sir, You have been appointed, with the approbation
                    of the President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Indian agent at Ft. Wayne, in the place of Dr. Turner, whose appointment ceased on the

                    commissioned accordingly."</p>
            <p>Because the mails moved slowly over the long road between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country, the secretary of war included directions to be followed in case Hays accepted
                    the appointment. After executing a heavy bond, he was to repair at once to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> and there report to the secretary, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and to Lewis Cass, governor of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Territory and head of the Indian superintendency of which the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> agency was a part.</p>
            <p>It was an offer full of promise, with a tempting salary of $1,200 a year. Of course, the
                    responsibilities were heavy. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been a resort for the Indians for a century. The Miami and Potawatomi who
                    frequented the place, sometimes in throngs of three or four thousand, still had large landholdings
                    in Indiana; and it was certain that the government would soon be urged to secure further cessions.
                    To gain and hold the Indians' confidence would require intelligence and tact.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hays' life had fitted him particularly well for the duties of managing agency funds and
                    dealing with the traders. He knew their problems and weaknesses. To control the liquor business in

                    </placeName>, and the problem was particularly troublesome there. Distribution of the Miami
                    annuities, the annual installments due the Indians in payment for ceded lands, was likely to present
                    difficulties, also. The Miami were a quarrelsome lot, restless under the domination of Jean B.
                    Richardviile, one of the cleverest, trickiest, and wealthiest half-breeds in the western country. He
                    had secured good terms for the Miami when they sold their lands, and the annual payments ran above
                    $18,000. But the Indians distrusted his division of the sum.</p>
            <p>Two serious drawbacks should have decided Hays against accepting the agency. <placeName>

                    he was a youngster buying furs and selling blankets in the Red River country, he had survived rough
                    journeys and scant food. On one occasion, caught in a devouring prairie snowstorm, he had weathered
                    three days and nights of extreme cold and near starvation. Now he was fifty years old; those days
                    recalled themselves in the agonies of rheumatism and a susceptibility to fever, and the <placeName>

                    It was not a heartening beginning, but it gave the new agent time to examine his situation
                    thoroughly.</p>
            <p>From the stockade, set high on the right bank of the Maumee, he could look down upon the junction of
                    the St. Mary's and <placeName>

                    </placeName> troops had been stationed within the stockade. When they departed, the Indian agency
                    was moved from an old log council house outside the walls to quarters inside. The structure was a
                    substantial one, rebuilt five years before, near the site of General <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s original fort. It was composed of hewn log buildings, joined by a double
                    twenty-foot picketed fence, and inclosing an area of about sixty square yards. To afford the maximum
                    protection against attack, the outer walls of the buildings rose abruptly to a height of thirty-five
                    feet, with the roofs slanting down towards the inside of the in-closure. In the dry August days of
                    his first survey, Hays did not discover a source of much later irritation—leaky roofs.</p>
            <p>Eighteen or twenty cabins composed the village. In one of these Samuel Hanna and his partner, James
                    Barnett, kept a little store as an adjunct to their fur-trading operations; another was headquarters
                    for Francis Comparet, agent of the American Fur Company, and his partner, Alexis Coquillard; but
                    most of the population was as impermanent and improvident as the Indians off whom they lived.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>Sharing the stockade with the Indian agency was an Indian school kept by Isaac McCoy, a Baptist
                    preacher turned missionary. McCoy promptly presented himself and asked permission to remain. A visit
                    to the school impressed Hays with the abilities of the twenty-six little Potawatomi and Miami,
                    leavened with a sprinkling of Shawnee, Chippewa, and Mohegans. While the boys studied agriculture
                    and mechanics, McCoy's hard-working wife taught the girls spinning, weaving, knitting, and
                    sewing. They excelled at anything requiring imitative ability—they could copy writing
                    with exactness long before they learned to read. Hays granted McCoy's request cheerfully,
                    not foreseeing the results. Within a year the number of students had doubled; in their free moments
                    they raced about the stockade like trapped woods creatures and caused an amount of damage that
                    nearly drove the agent to distraction.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    years. Without any official position beyond occasional service as interpreter, he had nevertheless
                    made himself extremely valuable to the Indian Department. Hays took an instant liking to the man and

            <p>For the next three months Hays applied himself to the problems of the agency. Turner had contracted
                    with an Ohioan named Benjamin Levell to build a saw and gristmill for the Miami Indians on the banks
                    of a small creek above the Mississinewa. The Miami were entitled to the mills—they had
                    been promised by the Treaty of St. Mary's two years before—but Turner made the
                    mistake of signing a contract involving $5,600 before it had been approved by Governor
                    Cass. At the end of August, Levell represented to Hays that the work was finished and that he had
                    not received a cent.</p>
            <p>When Cass saw the contract, he considered the price too high and refused to allow a settlement
                    without an examination of the mills. To complicate the situation, the mill dam broke. Chief
                    Richardville complained furiously to Governor Cass; Hays sent posthaste for Levell. Repairs were
                    made under the supervision of an experienced millwright, but Hays made the three-day journey down
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> to see for himself what had been done. The mills looked all right to him, but the
                    chiefs would have nothing to do with them; so Cass let the account wait until the next year.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Payment of the Miami annuity did not take place until the middle of November. This was at least a
                    month late, but the delay was not the agent's fault. He had received a check to cover the
                    payment—the amount was $18,181—on October 14; but the check was on
                    the Bank of <placeName>

            <p>As the season progressed, the Miami assembled about the fort—approximately eleven hundred

                    for the payment, but they chafed at being kept from the fall hunt. It had become an absolute

                    deer. Even an expert hunter seldom made more than one pack of furs in a season; this would not
                    clothe a family, and its money value was not more than a hundred dollars. Gaudy clothing and
                    jingling copper bells on leggings and shot pouches belied their uneasy temper, and Hays reported
                    afterward that never in his thirty-one years of experience with Indians had he seen so turbulent a

                    Richardville had handled as he pleased. To quiet them Hays instituted a new method of division. The
                    money was still handed over to the chief, but he was required to distribute it on the spot, one
                    silver dollar at a time to each member of the watching circle of tribesmen.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    ordered it sent inside the fort, but the Indians found plenty of secret caches and began a carousal
                    which lasted for days. Hays was as much surprised as he was relieved when they departed, at last,
                    without massacring the settlers or burning the stockade.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    estimate of expenditures for the next quarter. Regular items were the agent's salary,
                    $300; $126 for a blacksmith and the same amount for an interpreter;
                    $45 for the blacksmith's assistant; and a contingent fund which ran around

            <p>Hays had his feelings hurt in his first struggle with the payroll. Expecting to be paid from the date
                    of his appointment in May, he felt abused when the department ruled that his salary should begin on
                    July 16, the date on which he had dispatched his bond to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He protested in every report to headquarters, until reminded that his letter of July
                    16 was his first notification to the department that he intended to accept the agency, and that he
                    had not left Cahokia until several days later.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His health had suffered in the five months since he left home, and he begrudged the
                    months away from his family and his business affairs. He was alarmed by the uncontrollable temper of
                    the Miami and their mad passion for whisky and revolted by the grasping attitude of the traders who
                    furnished the liquor.</p>

                    Stickney, who was summoned to act as subagent, he intimated that he would not return.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Whether or not Calhoun had heard of Hays' dissatisfaction, he allowed his
                    appointment to go before the Senate for approval in January, 1821, and it was confirmed on March

                    </placeName>, but it was May before he dared attempt the journey. He collapsed after the first
                    fifteen miles. Several weeks later he started out again, with one of his daughters to look after
                        him.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he was on the way, Governor Cass stopped at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on his way to conduct a treaty at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Kercheval gave him the hospitality of the fort and next day accompanied him to the
                    Miami mills. Although neglected and unused, the mills seemed honestly built; and Cass conceded that
                    the builder should be paid.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One purpose of Cass's journey was to collect information on Indian history and customs. He
                    was interested in a man-eating society of the Miami, a small hereditary association whose members
                    were said to devour prisoners of war. On this subject he found the chiefs smoothly evasive, for the
                    society had been in disrepute for years. The next summer he pursued his investigation through the
                    agents of his superintendency. Hays made some inquiries but lost all interest when informed that to
                    learn the society's inner mysteries he must become a member.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>During his second summer at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Hays was obliged to curtail agency expenses from $5,000 to less than
                    $3,000 in line with a general reduction of funds for the Indian Department. He had always
                    cut corners economically and felt that further retrenchment would seriously disaffect the Indians.
                    The amount assigned him would not pay for the occasional pound of tobacco or loaf of bread which
                    every Indian considered his due. Hays' vigorous protest was echoed by other agents, and
                    Calhoun was obliged to allow them a little leeway.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hays wanted money also to repair the agency quarters, now in a "perfect decaying
                    state," as he reported to Calhoun, and particularly in need of shingles. And what was to be
                    done about McCoy's Indian pupils, who were tearing the public buildings to pieces?
                    Government property outside the stockade was suffering, too, for everyone made free use of the

            </p>
            <p>Asking for instructions on these matters, the agent made a special plea for some government order,
                    perhaps from the President, to end the sale of liquor to the Indians.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Of all
                    the troubles an agent had to contend with, this was the first and last and most insoluble. The
                    Indians would part with anything they had to secure whisky. By supplying it, the traders obtained
                    for themselves the annual take in furs and most of the annuity money. Although trespass and liquor
                    violations were punishable under the Trade and Intercourse Act, the courts were so far from <placeName>

            <p>In the northern part of Indiana the Potawatomi were more numerous than the Miami. They had ceded
                    little of their land, however, and their annuities were small. It had suited the government to pay
                    them at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but the Potawatomi objected to traveling a hundred miles for their annual stipend
                    while the Miami were paid at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Starting out hungry on the long journey, the young men provisioned themselves off the
                    cattle and hogs of the settlers. This resulted in claims for depredations which had to be paid out
                    of the annuity, and the net result was a wearisome trip and no reward for their trouble. Hays
                    earnestly recommended that the payment be transferred to <placeName>

            <p>The government took no notice of the request, but the following spring, with fine inconsistency, sent

                    </placeName> and accepting presents from the British. An outstanding warrior and orator named Metea
                    replied for the tribe, with a biting reference to the pleas they had made to be paid at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>

                    asked for plows and harness and rails enough to fence a communal field, agreeing to pay for tools
                    and labor out of their annuity.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> This request, coming from the truculent Miami,
                    gave Hays almost his first feeling of accomplishment to balance against many frustrations.</p>
            <p>In October, for the second time, he paid the Miami annuity. The occasion had a less explosive quality

                    Benjamin Levell, unfortunate builder of the Miami mills, who had been summoned to make new repairs.
                    Hays settled his long-standing account after an examination which indicated that what the mills

            <p>Isaac McCoy proposed a solution. His church board wanted to establish a new mission among the Miami.
                    Why not locate it at the mills and let a missionary serve as miller? Hays and Cass liked the idea,
                    but McCoy could not find a qualified person willing to accept the position; and having been
                    appointed superintendent of a school for the Potawatomi at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, he could not take it. The failure of this scheme left the mills as before, unguarded
                    and unused.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In July, Hays learned that the agency allowance would be $3,600—better than
                    last year's but still short of what he needed. "Stricter economy can not be used,
                    than what I have heretofore used," he wrote to Cass. "I refuse the Indians almost
                    every article they ask for, the Indians are much surprised at the sudden change….they
                    say, they were formerly accustomed to obtain what they asked for. it is very
                        unpleasant…."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cass could only advise continued economy. He suggested that Hays reduce expenses by allowing each
                    chief to receive and distribute the annuity money for his village. But the Indians had tried this
                    method, and their chiefs had "entrapped" them.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> They
                    assembled at the fort late in September and stayed for ten days. Early in the summer McCoy had
                    induced most of the settlers to join a temperance society, but it was never effective. Some of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> traders and all the outsiders who came to the payment brought their usual stock of
                    liquor. There were six murders.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A more cheerful aspect of the payment was the willingness with which the Miami paid their debts for
                    farming equipment and asked for more. "I have succeeded in getting that Tribe…to
                    cultivate the Earth," Hays wrote with satisfaction, and listed the villages where fencing
                    had been begun and a few log houses built—Turtle Town, on Eel River; the Forks of the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>

                    endure the fatiguing journeys to and from Cahokia, and he hoped for an appointment nearer home. He
                    sent his resignation to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> by Benjamin Kercheval, whom he confidently expected to succeed him. But he had
                    indiscreetly let word get about that he intended to resign, and the Indiana delegates in Congress
                    moved swiftly to put their own appointee into office. Hays learned with bitter disappointment of
                    their success. Not his friend Kercheval, who knew the agency and could be trusted to carry out his
                    policies, but a stranger named John <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> was to succeed him.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a friendly letter expressing regret at Hays' resignation, Calhoun asked him to stay until
                    after the Miami annuity payment.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> This was an added disappointment, for he was
                    anxious to be off as soon as possible. He instructed the chiefs to come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> in May for their money. Cass disapproved, for the early payment would take the Indians
                    from the fields at corn planting time and might cost them their crop. He urged the agent to remain
                    until autumn and make the payment at the usual time.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

                    number of tomahawkings made Hays glad that his connection with the agency was nearly over. In the

            <p>At the close of the American Revolution, Great Britain ceded to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> the area which, roughly speaking, lay between the Allegheny Mountains and the
                        <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. As a result of this cession, the problem of evolving a
                    colonial policy for this extensive region was transferred from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> across the Atlantic to the American capital at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In this, as in many other problems, the infant American Republic based its policy upon
                    British precedents.</p>
            <p>Four years after the formal completion of this cession, on July 13, 1787, the Confederation Congress
                    approved an ordinance for the organization and government of the Territory of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Northwest of the River <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Although this ordinance applied solely to the Northwest
                    Territory, its basic principles were subsequently applied to all American territory westward to the
                        Pacific.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This original Northwest Territory included the present states of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> According to the ordinance, this area and its subsequent
                    divisions were to evolve from a first or non-representative stage of government into a second or
                    representative stage in which some residents would have a part in the election of members of the
                    lower house of the Territorial Assembly. Although this second stage of government was similar to
                    that which existed in the royal and proprietary colonies on the eve of the American Revolution, it
                    was merely the last step preparatory to statehood. It was provided that the territory should
                    eventually be divided into not less than three nor more than five states. It was this promise of
                    statehood which most distinguished the new American colonial policy from the previous British
                    policy.</p>

            <p>Soon after the approval of the ordinance, Congress appointed Governor Arthur St. Clair and Judges
                    Samuel H. Parsons, James M. Varnum, and John Cleves Symmes to inaugurate the first stage of
                    government for the Old Northwest.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> For a decade these men and their successors
                    had almost complete charge of territorial affairs. During this period the American settlements,
                    within the territory, were made principally in the eastern area which soon became the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Conditions of transportation and communication and the location of the early
                    settlements were such that the more remote inhabitants were unable to share equally in the benefits
                    of the new regime.</p>
            <p>Not long after the arrival of the governor and judges, there had developed some agitation for a
                    division of the territory.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In 1798 Governor St. Clair decided that there were
                    enough freemen to justify his proclaiming the transition to the second stage of government.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> This change resulted in increased taxes to pay for the additional cost of the
                    Assembly, public printing, and miscellaneous items.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The increased taxes
                    provided another incentive to the demand for division, since residents of the more remote areas did
                    not wish to pay taxes to support a government which seemed to give little, if any, benefit to them.</p>
            <p>In March, 1800, Congress received two memorials from the western part of the Northwest Territory.
                    Both complained of enormous taxes and asked for a division of the territory which would return their
                    area to the less expensive first stage of government. The first petition came from George Tevebaugh
                    and two hundred residents<hi rend="sup">8</hi> of <placeName>

                    that Congress would make a judicious division of the territory and not only relieve them of
                    "the heavy territorial taxes" but also bring justice closer to the door of each

                    until the American conquest in 1778, that from then until 1790 the area had been neglected and left
                    without either laws or government, nor had the anticipated relief been experienced with the

            <p>Another factor involving financial considerations which contributed to a division of the area was the
                    need for an increase in the number of judges for the Northwest Territory. The judicial system had
                    been the subject of much complaint from the very beginning of the territorial government.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The situation was explained in a letter which St. Clair wrote to a fellow
                    Federalist late in 1799. The governor recommended that the territory be divided, since it would be
                    necessary in either case to increase the number of federal judges for the region. St. Clair
                    explained, although not quite accurately, that the additional cost arising from a division would be
                    a mere trifle, "the salary of one governor."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> At the same

                    this problem. Such <list type="footnotes">

            <p>On May 7, 1800, President John Adams approved an act which created the Indiana Territory. By the
                    first section of this act the new territory was made to include all of that part of the parent
                    territory which lay west of a line beginning at the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> The newly established territory was to be governed according to
                    the provisions of the Ordinance of 1787, and the inhabitants therein were promised all the benefits
                    and privileges granted in this fundamental document. The structure of the new government was to be
                    identical with that of the original area. Indiana was exempted from the requirement that there must
                    be five thousand free male inhabitants before the second stage could be adopted. This stage should
                    be assumed whenever the governor had satisfactory evidence that a majority of the freeholders wished
                    to make such a change. <placeName>

                    organization of the territory was to become effective on July 4 following, which was the
                    twenty-fourth anniversary of American independence.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> By this act the residents
                    of the Indiana Territory were returned to the less expensive first stage of government; and the
                    judicial system was also improved, since the new arrangement called for three judges in each

                    Gibson's entry were the most important officers of this non-representative stage, and all
                    were appointees of the federal government. The governor, as chief executive and superintendent of
                    Indian affairs, exercised very great authority. He and the judges constituted the legislature, and
                    according to the 1787 ordinance, this legislature was required to adopt its laws from the codes of
                    the original states. Serving in their judicial capacity, the judges were at times called upon to
                    review laws which they had helped frame. The secretary kept the record of the executive
                        proceedings<hi rend="sup">24</hi> and at times served as acting governor. A treasurer<hi rend="sup">25</hi> and an attorney general,<hi rend="sup">26</hi> appointed by Governor Harrison
                    early in 1801,<hi rend="sup">27</hi> were apparently the only other officials at this stage. This
                    government was entirely non-representative, but it was well suited to the situation within the

                    governmental structure at this stage is suggestive of the very limited financial expenditures which
                    were required for its maintenance.</p>
            <p>The expenditures of this stage were even more limited than would be anticipated from the above
                    survey. The governor received $2,000, the secretary, $750, and each of the

                    expended. Hence, it may be concluded that the federal government contributed about $5,500
                    yearly for the above-suggested salaries and contingent fund. There is no doubt that the salary
                    compensation to the governor and judges would have been very much less had such been provided from
                    the territorial treasury.</p>
            <p>Although the expenditures just noted seem exceedingly small, they were large when contrasted to the
                    appropriations which were supplied by the territory from its own revenues. The salary of the
                    territorial treasurer and attorney general were so small as to be almost negligible. A law of 1801
                    allowed the treasurer six per cent of his collections, but six per cent of a very small sum is a
                    very much smaller sum.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Late in 1802 a resolution adopted by the <placeName>

                    be too high. Since the federal government contributed about $5,500 yearly to the
                    territorial expenses of this period, it may then be estimated that the total territorial expenses
                    averaged about $5,700 during the years of the first stage of Indiana's

            <p>The fiscal question was much involved in the movement which led from the first to the second stage of
                    territorial government. Opposition to increased taxation was apparently the only important objection
                    to the adoption of the second stage. Most of the information about this transition comes from the
                    columns of Indiana's first newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi>, which Elihu
                    Stout commenced at <placeName>

                    con on the question, but it appears reasonably certain that Editor Stout favored the adoption of the

            </p>
            <p>As early as 1802 there had been some agitation for establishment of the second stage. This abortive
                    agitation was probably the result of personal politics within the territory and it was apparently
                    supported by the pro-slavery element.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> At this time Harrison opposed the
                    change, writing a letter stressing the increases in taxes which would result from such a
                        transition.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> The fact that the governor did not then proclaim the adoption
                    of the second stage suggests that he was personally opposed to the movement.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

                                    strongly defended the transition to the second stage. During the fall of 1804 there
                                    was discussion about a proposed "affair of honor" between Parke

                    flatter himself with acquiring property by gaining an appointment…." The annual
                    cost of the second grade was estimated as not more than $3,500. Members of the Assembly
                    would receive but one dollar per day; while the treasurer and auditor would divide $200
                    annually between them, and the attorney general would receive $200 for the same period of

            <p>One week after the appearance of "Gerald's" article the Gazette reported
                    that a well-attended meeting of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> inhabitants had agreed upon an address to the freeholders, advocating entrance to the
                    second stage, with only one dissenting vote. Colonel Francis Vigo, who had given financial aid to
                    Clark during the latter's western campaign of 1778–1779, was the chairman of
                    this meeting; and the address adopted was very similar in content to the article by
                    "Gerald." The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> address cited some advantages of the proposed second grade and explained certain
                    financial aspects of the transition. It emphasized that the governor and judges were unable to adopt
                    a well-regulated system of finance under the existing system, as codes of the other states were
                    unsatisfactory in most respects. It was claimed that the rates were too high in some of these codes,
                    that the manner of collection was improper in others, while some of them lacked desirable
                        exemptions.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> It was suggested that a representative legislature could
                    remedy these evils and also the unequal mode of taxation "by which a man who does not own a
                    foot of land, pays as much and often more taxes, than his neighbor who has several thousand acres of
                    land in the territory, for which he does not pay a cent."<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

                    the same estimate as had been made by "Gerald." It also supported the principle of
                    liberal salaries, but added that circumstances would not then allow such to be paid. The detailed
                    estimates of the address were strikingly similar to those indicated by "Gerald."
                    Legislators were to be allowed one dollar per day; but even if they sat seventy days annually, this
                    expense would be less than $1,000 per year. The salaries proposed for the treasurer,
                    auditor, and attorney general were identical <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">60</hi> It will be recalled that the authority of the governor and judges
                            was limited to the adoption of laws from the codes of original states, although in practice

                            This part of the address was probably an appeal to the prejudice against land

                    printing expense was considered uncertain, but it would not exceed $1,000 yearly for four
                    or five years and probably only about one-half of this amount. The pay of officers to the
                    legislature was calculated at $.300 per year; and an equal amount was allowed for rent,
                    fuel, and stationery, leaving $500 yearly to provide for tax collections and
                    contingencies. These figures were considered fair, practical, and candid.</p>
            <p>To discharge these obligations it was calculated that there were about one million acres of land
                    which could be taxed at fifty cents per one hundred acres (or one-half cent per acre), yielding a
                    yearly sum of $5,000. Furthermore, as the population and resources of the territory
                    increased, this ratio of taxation could either be diminished or else a much larger sum could be
                    raised. A revenue of this amount would not be burdensome for: "The rich will pay it; the
                    poor need not complain." Lastly, all lands sold by the federal government would immediately
                    become subject to taxation "and not exempt as has been perfidiously stated by designing
                        individuals."<hi rend="sup">62</hi> In view of these various factors, the address urged

                    share equally in the benefits of the representative level, although they were apparently asked to

                    to note how the agitation about fiscal affairs was in substance repeated as successive territorial
                    divisions and changes in government were made within what had been the original area of the Old

            <p>Indiana was formally in the second stage from December 5, 1804, when Harrison proclaimed the new
                    level, until December 11, 1816, when admitted as a state. The inauguration of the second stage added
                    to but did not destroy any of the structure of the preceding level. The governor, a secretary, and
                    judges continued as appointees of the federal government. The authority and role of the governor
                    were virtually unchanged save that he ceased to be a member of the legislature, although he had an
                    absolute veto over legislation. The secretary continued his dual role as secretary and acting
                    governor in event of an emergency. The three judges ceased to be members of the territorial
                    legislature but still exercised very important judicial duties. The offices of treasurer and
                    attorney general, established in 1801, were continued, but the latter office was abolished in

            <p>The establishment of a representative Assembly was the most important addition to the governmental
                    machinery in the second stage. This body was bicameral with an elected lower house and an upper

                    government was inaugurated, the members of the lower house of the Assembly were the only popularly
                    elected officials of the territorial government. The governor and judges were appointed by the
                    President, and the treasurer, auditor, attorney general, and chancellor were appointed by the
                    governor. The new level resulted in a considerable increase in the amount of legislation,<hi rend="sup">99</hi> making necessary additional legislative officers. At this time the territory
                    also gained the privilege of having a territorial delegate, elected by the Assembly, to represent it
                    in Congress. This delegate had a status about midway between that of a colonial agent and a
                    representative and was compensated by the federal government.<hi rend="sup">100</hi> As a

                    were approximately correct. It will be recalled that each estimated the cost of the proposed stage
                    at about $3,500 yearly.<hi rend="sup">125</hi> This figure is so near the sum indicated
                    by the above survey that it may be considered the estimated annual cost of the second stage to the
                    residents and landowners of the territory. Adding this sum to the annual average of federal
                    appropriations, the grand total of all territorial expenditures amount to about $10,000
                    yearly for the period 1805 to 1816 inclusive. The total expenditures during the second stage were
                    almost double the same for the first stage.</p>
            <p>Viewing the years 1800 to 1816 as a whole, some summary observations may be made concerning
                    territorial expenditures. The residents of the area which became the Indiana Territory favored the
                    establishment of a first-stage territory partly because they desired to avoid the increased taxes
                    which had resulted from the adoption of the second stage for the Northwest Territory in 1798. Since
                    it was desirable to increase the number of judges in the Northwest Territory, with or without a
                    division, Congress was able to establish a new territory, in 1800, without doubling the expense of
                    governing the area.</p>
            <p>The most serious objection to the adoption of the second stage was the additional cost involved. The
                    increased cost of this stage was principally due to the inauguration of an Assembly and higher
                    salaries to the judges and secretary. The transition to the second stage gave an impetus to the
                    agitation of the more remote settlements for new territorial governments, hastening the formation of
                    separate territories for the <placeName>

            <p>The figures quoted in this article may appear incredible to readers who are accustomed to fiscal
                    figures extending upward into the millions and billions of dollars; but the very limited nature of
                    territorial expenditures is only an index of the simple beginnings of the economic, social, and
                    political life of Indiana during its period of infancy.</p>

            <p>A reviewer in the <hi rend="i">
                  <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical Review</hi>
                    recently criticized an author in these words: "His local history is, however, so erroneous
                    as greatly to impair an otherwise scholarly work." By "local history" the
                    reviewer seems to mean the historical geography of the locality with which he was concerned. His
                    additional statement that the work of many historians shows similar weakness is an indication of the
                    importance to the study of local history of investigators who know the locality and its relation to
                    larger units. Academic historians, even when dealing with large areas and general movements, run
                    into errors if they proceed without spade work of local historians. This is true, not only of their
                    geographical references, but also of many other details upon which sound historical work depends.</p>
            <p>How unsafe it is to write history solely on the basis of state and national documents and books
                    covering large fields is illustrated by a recent development in this state. Several years ago the
                    Indiana Historical Records Survey, a WPA project, made and published inventories of county archives
                    of Indiana. Each of the inventories which was completed included a short history of the county and a
                    list of the duties of the county officers, as well as a detailed list of the county records. The
                    account of duties and responsibilities of officers was compiled at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> from state legislation dealing with these offices from the beginning down to date. This
                    account was practically the same for all of the counties. Consequently, special and particular
                    duties imposed by special and local legislation and by local circumstances upon officials in certain
                    counties, duties peculiar to one county, were overlooked.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi rend="i">Inventory</hi> of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marshall County</region>
                    </placeName> Archives made no mention of the responsibility of the county authorities at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, assumed under the Act making a state appropriation for the erection of the Menominee
                    Village monument, to maintain the monument after it was erected and to keep it is good order. Even
                    if the county officials looked to the <hi rend="i">Inventory</hi> for information on their
                    responsibilities, they would not know of this particular duty laid upon them. In this respect the
                    historical sketch and other parts of the <hi rend="i">Inventory</hi>
                    <pb n="278" id="VAA4025-039-3-060"/> were of no particular application. This item is not cited as a
                    reflection on the workers in the WPA project (of which indeed the Indiana Historical Bureau was
                    sponsor), but as an illustration of a defect common to a great deal of historical work—a
                    defect which is a partial explanation of the lack of interest in historical writings among men of
                    affairs and of their failure to use them.</p>
            <p>An instance of the help which local historians may give to those working in a larger field has come

                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>'s career. While the articles add little that is new to the story of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s life, they are valuable as corroborative material on several points about
                    which information was meager and unsatisfactory. They deserve a place in any <placeName>

            <p>Emphasis is needed both on historians generally paying more attention to local history and on the
                    call for local historians who feel the dignty of such work. Local historical societies, for the most
                    part, find it hard to get people to participate in their activities, even people of ability and good
                    historical education in the schools who ought to realize the significance of such work. If these
                    people could sense the fascination and the value of accurate and complete information about the
                    history of their communities, it would mean much, both for the local historical society and for the
                    general welfare.</p>

            <p>Jonathan Jennings was a very important character in the early days of Indiana. He represented Indiana
                    Territory in the Congress of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from 1809 to 1816, and in this capacity he was the agent who directed the passage of
                    the Enabling Act which authorized statehood for Indiana. He was elected a delegate to the first
                    Indiana Constitutional Convention in 1816 and was chosen president of that convention. He became
                    Indiana's first governor and served two terms, 1816 to 1822. A third consecutive term not
                    being constitutional, he became a candidate for Congressman and was elected as Indiana's
                    member of the lower house of Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of William
                    Hendricks. He was then elected for four terms as the representative of the second Indiana
                    congressional district before retiring from politics. This long period of political activity and the
                    prominent positions which he held make his literary remains important to the student of Indiana
                    history.</p>
            <p>The following letters of Jennings are, in the main, published here for the first time. Only three
                    have been previously published and these in newspapers which now are not too readily accessible.</p>
            <p>Mrs. W. H. McDonald of North Platte, <placeName>

                    written by Jennings to John K. Graham. Mrs. Minnie Graham Zapp of New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, also possesses copies of two letters which are included in the following
                    group. These letters were also written to John K. Graham. Miss Margaret H. Wagenhals of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City loaned from the Wagenhals Collection five letters, which were written by Jennings
                    to Jesse L. Holman. Miss Dorothy Riker of the Indiana Historical Bureau, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has sent three letters—one from Jonathan Jennings to John F. Ross, the
                    original of which is in the possession of Margaret Ross <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Seymour</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and two letters from Jennings to Samuel <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milroy</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the originals of which are in the possession of Mrs. Mary S. Clauser of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Miss Riker also sent copies of two letters which were published in the <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-039-3-062"/>
                    <placeName>

                    </placeName>, <hi rend="i">Liberty Hall</hi>, and one in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, <hi rend="i">Western Eagle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These letters throw further light upon the character and attainments of Jennings. They contribute
                    some additional information in respect to Jennings' antagonistic attitude toward Governor
                    William Henry Harrison during the territorial period. The reference in the letter of November 9,
                    1811, to the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> as the "Massacre on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>" is interesting. The reference on April 8, 1812, to the likelihood of war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> unless the "Orders in Council at least, shall be rescinded or so modified [as]
                    to cease to injure our Neutral rights on the Ocean" is an illustration of a Western
                    representative writing about neutral rights when, we have been led to believe, he must have been
                    thinking more about Western causes of the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>The letters reveal Jennings' careful attention to local matters such as public lands, pay of
                    the militia, post offices and post roads, and patronage. Unfortunately, the letters give very little
                    information about the constitutional convention. Later letters give some information regarding
                    internal improvements.</p>
            <p>As these letters were ready for the press, information was received of some additional Jennings
                    letters which, it is expected, will be printed in a later issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi>

                        <salute>My very dear Sir.</salute>
                        <p>Much was my disappointment, when I returned to this place and found you
                                    gone—gone for four years—gone without even leaving me one line
                                    to remind me of the past—the past which promised me (I thought) a lasting
                                    friendship—a friendship which I prised as being founded on the firmest
                                    basis—a basis which alone is capable of supporting real friendship, I
                                    mean the basis of an honest heart—a free and generous mind guarded by the
                                    strongest barriers of well settled principles of morality &amp; rectitude.
                                    Graham, to you could I have deposited the greatest secrets of my heart &amp; in
                                    your friendship I anticipated <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-039-3-063"/>

                                    after examing [sic] the most curious scene to form an opinion of what our Territory
                                    is in reality.</p>
                        <p>The Committee of Elections have reported, that the Govenor [sic] made an
                                    apportionment without any law to authorise him, and also that he ordered election to
                                    be held on a day not appointed by law.</p>
                        <p>I shall be with you and become a Candidate unless my friends are tired of me already,
                                    but I hope they will until I render an account of what I have done.</p>
                        <p>To support my election I had to advocate the Govenor's conduct and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                                    </placeName> on the other hand was trying to prove it illegal by producing the laws

                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        <p>I made a long argument before the Committee of Elections to prove Harrison had acted
                                    legally—whilst <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                                    </placeName> produced laws enough to prove that his conduct was not legal, but still
                                    alledged, that the Govenor was not to blame because he could do no otherwise.</p>
                        <p>This was playing off Camelion in earnest.</p>

                        <p>Why have you not written me ere now. I have not had one sentence upon Territorial
                                    measures since I arrived save a few hints by Mr. Lemon—</p>
                        <p>Persevere my dear friend the day will shortly be ours—Our Govenor has
                                    depreciated at least 50 per Cent since last Spring and if he keeps pace for a few
                                    months in his sinking way, he will have to put into the sinking fund to prevent his
                                    value from being entirely lost—</p>

                                    told him that he doubted very much of the integrity of Harrison Then conversation
                                    commenced upon the subject of the last treaty—We have no news as yet,</p>

                        <p>I am aware that the payment which is to be made by Gwathmey, requires one to be made

                        <p>Your letter of the 22d of last month I received last evening. I am very glad that you
                                    have a prospect of making at least as much as will support you—You
                                    acknowledge the receipt of my draft by a former letter and you may in the course of
                                    two weeks after the arrival of this letter at the farthest apply to Mr. Bayliss for
                                    80 dollars more and for that purpose I will enclose you a draft in this letter,

                                    the author as well as myself, I must declare, that I have too often witnessed his
                                    talents exerted in favor of the wishes of the people of the Territory, to believe
                                    that he intended to make, or did make, any invidious distinction between those brave
                                    men. I was present when the speech alluded to was made, and if any remarks had been
                                    offered, prejudicial to the militia or volunteers of the Territory, I should have

                        <p>In the remarks made by me in the House of Representatives, in support of the claim of
                                    the officers and soldiers who served in the <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                                    </placeName> campaign, to one month's extra pay. I made no
                                    "invidious distinction" between the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                                    </placeName> militia and volunteers and those of Indiana, altho the contrary might
                                    be inferred from a short and imperfect report of my remarks, published in the
                                    Intelligencer. I did say, and continue to say, that the militia did their duty in a
                                    manner highly honorable to themselves and fully equal to the occasion, and as to the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                                    </placeName> militia, both gov. Harrison and col. Boyd bore evidence of the able
                                    manner in which they did their duty. The remark was only introduced in reply to a
                                    statement deduced from some letter of col. Boyd, which statement certainly could not
                                    have intended any reflection on the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                                    </placeName> militia, and if conceived in the spirit of censure at all, that censure
                                    was not intended to fall on the militia of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                        <p>I regret that any blame should be attributed to me, more especially as I am
                                    unconscious of deserving any. Of this fact, you sir must bear evidence; and if any
                                    injurious distinction had been taken, you, I am sure, would not have failed at the
                                    proper time to correct it. I am sir, respectfully yours obediently,</p>

                                    benefit of the indulgence and thereby ruined the assignees.</p>
                        <p>To correct such misrepresentations, permit me to request that you will answer me the
                                    following inquiries, viz; whether or not I endeavored to have the time of payment of
                                    the Public Lands extended as long as possible and to every purchaser without
                                    discrimination? Whether or not I endeavored to have the back interest remitted, and
                                    whether Congress during the present session, has not done more for the purchasers of
                                    the public lands, than has been done for them at any former period.</p>
                        <p>With great esteem I am your's very respectfully.</p>

                                    House of Representatives, to have the greatest possible extension of the time of
                                    payment allowed to the purchasers of public lands without discrimination, and also
                                    to have the back interest remitted; and that you had no agency in framing either the

                        <p>The extension of time to purchasers, is more ample by the late act, than by any

                        <p>Your letter which I received shortly before the adjournment of the last Session I
                                    carried in person to the General Post Office. The Post Master Genl. expressed doubts
                                    of the expediency of the proposed establishment and observed he would take it into
                                    consideration. I believe I shall be able to succeed however, but the Post Master
                                    Genl. is now absent from the City, lying sick in new jersey and the Assistant P. M.
                                    General cannot find your former letter. These circumstances render it necessary that
                                    I should ask you to give me the name of the gentleman who should be appointed Post
                                    Master at New <placeName>

                                    far as your are acquainted with them.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Jennings has been unwell nearly all the past Summer and fall. I hope and intend
                                    to be with you soon after the present Session shall terminate.</p>

                        <p>In the hurry of business, with which I have been pressed since my last arrival at
                                    this place, I have hardly had time to write a line on any other subject than
                                    relative to my representative duty. I have never learned whether you are at New <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                                    </placeName> or not, but address you as if there. I should be very glad to hear from
                                    you often and if you have not fixed a plan for your next summers, and after
                                    residence, prior to your settlement on your own domain, think of fixing yourself on
                                    my place for a while. It may be necessary however for you to come to a determination
                                    on this if you have not, before the Spring arrives, otherwise I may be induced to
                                    enter into arrangements which would not afterwards admit of the plan proposed

                                    and discovered by the wise acres of this place, only through the delusive medium of
                                    European Continental wars—</p>
                        <p>In making my arrangements for the ensuing summer, I have determined not to conclude
                                    finally, what they shall be, until I ask of you whether or not it will be convenient
                                    for you to pay me, any time next spring, any part, and how much of the sum which is
                                    between us—In putting this interrogatory to you, I trust you know me too
                                    well, to construe it into a demand. I should not have asked you the question but for
                                    your own observations that you expected to make it convenient—If it will
                                    be convenient, I wish to know it soon, and if it will not for the same reason I wish
                                    to be informed—If it will not be entirely convenient, or in other words,
                                    if it was not your expectation to be prepared for any reimbursement, before this
                                    letter reached you, I beg of you not to let my enquiry urge you the least, to any
                                    earlier payment—I have enjoyed but indifferent health since I last left <placeName>

                                    will not oblige me if you sacrifice any interest of yours to the object of
                                    repayment. I write as I feel. It was my friendship that induced me to loan, and that
                                    friendship undiminished, would be wounded if you were, because of my letter on this

                        <salute>My Dear Sir.</salute>
                        <p>I enclose to you a letter for your safe and confidential keeping. Therein you will
                                    find a pledge in your favour, which, according to my recollection of the profits of
                                    surveying, will be sufficient to lay the ground work of your future competency, at
                                    no distant period, and believe me, it yields me no small satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>If my life is spared, be assured, that there is nothing fallacious in this, and those
                                    bounty lands will soon be operated upon, must be, by the faith of the government.</p>
                        <p>I have directed Govr. Tiffen to direct to you at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, I. T and I will see that any communications he may make you, shall
                                    reach you. I feared that a direction to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">N. Albany</settlement>
                                    </placeName> might be more liable to a miscarriage. Of this subject say nothing to
                                    any person, only do not bind yourself by any contract, until you again hear from me,
                                    by which you would place it beyond your power to avail yourself of the advantage
                                    which the enclosed presents.</p>
                        <p>When I see you I shall explain on the subject of your invention. I really have hardly

                                    proceed with safety—</p>
                        <p>Let me hear from you, and know as soon as possible whether you wish to do the
                                    survying of Ten Townships, or whether you would rather undertake a less
                                    quantity—My object is, if it be not your desire, to oblige another man,
                                    with the ballance if you should not wish to survey the ten Townships

                        <salute>Dear Sir.</salute>
                        <p>Once more I have reached the metropolis of our country where gaiety, formality and
                                    the rounds of fashionable folly are the order of the day with the people of high
                                    life. Here the cheerful simplicity of rural maners are unknown as well as the
                                    pleasures they afford to the circles of domestic life. It really seems to me that
                                    these swarms of fashionable empherons, neither think nor speak, without consulting
                                    whether or not it be the <hi rend="i">mode.</hi> Here every face wears a smile
                                    either feigned or real, though poverty unveiled, retrenches the necessities of life

                        <p>With my little stock of skill in human [nature], I have never thought myself safe to

                        <p>The City presents a very different aspect, compared with last autumn. The publick
                                    edifices, destroyed by the British Vandals, are repairing, and will be in a great
                                    measure, again compled [sic] in the course of another year.</p>
                        <p>Personal enterprize in every art is exhibiting itself on a large scale since the last
                                    Session of Congress. We have but little European news or domestic either save what
                                    is contained in the message of the President of the <placeName>

                                    </placeName>—I am not very well, but able to write you a short letter.
                                    How much the taxes may be reduced I am yet unable to say. I am dear Sir, with great
                                    esteem your friend.</p>

                        <salute>Dr. Sir,</salute>
                        <p>I was pleased at the reception of your letter and the history you give me of the late
                                    proceedings of Corydon. I must admit that <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                                    </placeName> would be more convenient than Corydon to accommodate a Convention. But
                                    it seems a majority of the Legislature did not think so, and I cannot take upon
                                    myself a responsibly, where nothing but convenience is at stake, and which would
                                    only involve myself. I would willingly have voted it in the Legislature, but here it
                                    is not my business since the Legislature has prescribed the seat of Government as
                                    the spot where the convention shall meet. Besides I have an interest in and near <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, which would give additional pretexts for clamour, and charges of
                                    personal interestedness in Legislation.</p>
                        <p>You will perceive by publications that I have at length and with much pressing got
                                    the militia services of our Territory recognized, and they will be paid, though they
                                    will have to wait a while as money is yet not too plenty with the Government. There
                                    is no need as yet for the officers to do any thing in relation to their claims. Ere
                                    long and in due time for them, I shall make a further communication if it shall be
                                    necessary. I should be gratified to be in the convention as I have no doubt the law
                                    under which it will be formed will be strictly examined. As to being a candidate for
                                    Govenor, I cannot yet positively say, it will be full time enough you know,
                                    hereafter. It may be. With respect and esteem I am your friend &amp; Humble St.</p>

                        <p>I have been favoured with your letter of the 1st inst: by Saturday evenings mail. I
                                    had been long expecting to hear from you, and would have written you before now, but
                                    for the croud of letters and addresses recieved from Indiana, produced by the late
                                    Proclamation of the President ordering the settlers off the Publick
                                    Lands—</p>
                        <p>The news here that could interest you, of a general character, can be communicated,
                                    only by laborious detail. I must therefore decline such attempt, as the Publick
                                    journals convey every particular.</p>
                        <p>In relation to Indiana, and its probable change of its form of government, I have no
                                    doubt a law will pass at some period of the present Session of Congress, for the
                                    purpose, on terms as favourable, if not much more so, than have been acceaded to any
                                    other of the Territories of the U. States—</p>
                        <p>You have no doubt a heavy charge to perform in your judicial capacity, and have to
                                    taste the <hi rend="i">fruits</hi> of <hi rend="i">much</hi> absence from your
                                    chosen residence, from your home and family, from your beloved retirement, from your
                                    groves and gardens and dreams of rural felicity,—</p>
                        <p>Not long since I recieved a letter from our worthy friend Mr. Hendricks. He informed
                                    me that, in his opinion, no country ever <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-039-3-073"/>

                        <p>Will you or will you not, become a Candidate with the many to meet in convention, if
                                    the law to authorize it shall be enacted by Congress?—If long absence
                                    would allow me, I should be gratified in passing two or three days with you on my
                                    return. I shall hardly do more than obtain a nights lod[g]ing with you. With much

                        <p>The Constitution nor laws of this State provides that any officer shall give a legal
                                    opinion to the Executive. A question has been made, whether the Executive can

                                    such contest can be decided. Without any reference to objections which may be made
                                    to any of the late elections, allow me to request of you the favour, to inform me by

                        <salute>Dear Sir.</salute>
                        <p>I received your letter by Doc. Ferris and am obliged to you for the trouble you have
                                    taken in the monied concern which you had. It is all correct and satisfactory and
                                    herewith I return the receipt the receipt <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> and pay the
                                    postage of this letter as it principally regards my own interest and business.</p>
                        <p>I will now give you some detail of political events. On the meeting of the
                                    Legislature, great exertion was made in the House of Representatives, to recognize
                                    Lt. Govr. as acting, upon the reports of the news papers of the day, or upon what
                                    Harrison considered as an official communication through the Paper edited by Mr.
                                    Nelson. I cannot enter upon a detail of all the various resolutions and motions,
                                    they would croud a sheet themselves, but when you see them your good sense will
                                    perceive the solecisms which several of them present.</p>
                        <p>The House after spending several days on the subject indefinitely postponed it. Since
                                    when several seem very anxious to fix on a candidate that may out poll me next
                                    august, and talk as if desirous of having a <hi rend="i">caucus</hi> for that
                                    purpose. The Senate had nothing to do in the whole transaction, at least by any act
                                    which appears on the record of their proceedings Those who are most desirous of
                                    affecting me urge the idea of bringing you forward as a candidate for the Office of
                                    Govenor at next election.</p>
                        <p>What I have given you is the substance of what has transpired here, except what the
                                    publick papers will give you. I have delay writing until the "Govenor
                                    question," was decided and delayed also until nearly the hour of the mail.</p>
                        <p>Excuse my short letter, and believe me yours with respect &amp;
                                    esteem—</p>

                                    from which you will perceive how uncertain are our mails at this season of the year.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Land Office appointment, there are many applicants, most of whom
                                    [are] my political friends and some of them very respectable. There names I must
                                    give (I mean those entitled to that attention) to the government with yours, and
                                    likewise their general character, and then shall designate those whom I wish to be
                                    appointed; viz yourself and <hi rend="i">one</hi> other. This course I have deemed
                                    in the first place, as proper with regard to all the applicants, and in the last
                                    place, as proper with regard to myself. This course I shall pursue and none other,

                                    appointments in our state hereafter while I am here at least, I shall take some
                                    trouble to let the good people of the State know the fact and the circumstances
                                    leading to such transaction if it shall ever again take place.</p>
                        <p>Every thing here among certain men of certain views look with a very jealous eye upon
                                    any proposition which touches the Public Lands or the completion of our great
                                    Western national road; more so than I could have believed before I witnessed it.
                                    There is a system of management here to make a certain man President, which goes to
                                    great lengths; but I want to see Domestic manufacturers flourish and internal
                                    improvement progress as fast as these objects can be accomplished without a resort
                                    to internal tax; and as to taxing the manufacturing of whiskey without levying a tax
                                    or impost upon imported spirits, which would amount to a prohibition of its
                                    consumption in the U. States unless by the Overgrown in wealth, the idea is absurd.
                                    Narrow policy always takes narrow measures; for you know that a tax would be popular
                                    in your County with those who think it a moral evil either to make the whiskey let
                                    alone to drink it—</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                        <p>Some difficulty has occurred between Jno. H. Thompson and myself in relation to a few
                                    facts with regard to the relief of purchasers of Publick lands Thompson says he
                                    first raised his voice in behalf of the purchasers, without a hint from any man but
                                    Genl. S. Milroy. I have understood that you intimated to Thompson, that your county
                                        <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-039-3-076"/> was interested in a measure, which you
                                    intended to introduce the next day, which was a motion in behalf of Land purchasers,
                                    and that Thompson, took the advantage of you and introduced it without your consent
                                    or knowledge and with which you were displeased. This took place during the Session
                                    of 1819 &amp; 1820—</p>
                        <p>Will you oblige me by giving the facts to me in a letter, with regard to this
                                    business, and be pleased to state what were the prayers of the Memorial sent to
                                    Congress pursuant to Thompson's resolution—</p>
                        <p>You will oblige me much by giving me an answer as soon as possible—I do
                                    not intend to publish your letter at any time unless with your express consent, but
                                    to have it as a document—</p>

                        <salute>My dear Sir.</salute>
                        <p>I have never learned whether you got a copy of the Report of the Engineers invitation
                                    to a "Western Armory"—After you and I last parted I
                                    called at the office of the "Indiana Intelligencer Co" but they
                                    were disappointed—The Report I sent was in the hands of Mr. Lingan and he
                                    not at home at the time but Dunkin told me he would have the pamphlet at Doc.r Hays
                                    on the succeeding day—There is a copy however in the hands of O. Raymond
                                    Esqr. at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. I should be extremely gratified, if you could investigate and make
                                    some comments on so much of it as relates to the opposite sides of the falls of <placeName>

                                    to give much in addition to what you gave me last winter in as much as, at that
                                    time, you had not the official report of the engineers before you—If I
                                    could get your comments on it by the first of January or 15th of December next, it
                                    would be very gratifying to me.</p>

                                    this House,—When it became the order of the day the Committee of the
                                    whole, took up the Bill on the same Subject, which had previously passed the Senate,
                                    and which Bill from the senate, (now having become a law) is substantially what the
                                    enclosed Bill, except the 3d Section, which the Senate's Bill did not
                                    contain—Now Hendricks is a member of the Committee of Roads and Canals of
                                    the Senate, which reported the Bill, which is not a law—This is

                        <p>I proposed the third Section of the enclosed Bill as an amendment, and as an

                                    intimated to Mr. Haynes to offer as an amendment to my amendment the proposition to
                                    have a survey of both sides of the river before any payment should be made to the <placeName>

               <hi rend="i">The Origin and Development of the Missionary Baptist Church of Indiana.</hi> By John
                    A. Cady. (<placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>: <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
               </placeName> College, 1942. Pp. 354. $3.00.)</head>
            <p>This well-written, fully documented volume is an excellent example of recent encouraging developments
                    in denominational history-writing in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The author is a trained historian; and the volume is based upon an impressive list of
                    primary sources, many of them manuscripts. Though a loyal Baptist, Mr. Cady opproaches his task as
                    an objective historian. He is not blind to the faults and failures of the church of his inheritance,
                    nor is he lacking in understanding and appreciation of its contributions. The book is also
                    undergirded by an unusual number of recent special studies, most of them University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Master's and Doctor's theses. It is heartening to have this evidence
                    of their worth. Indeed, it is the increase of such studies which renders the rewriting of church
                    history in America a welcome necessity, and Mr. Cady is to be commended for helping to set a high
                    standard for such rewriting.</p>
            <p>As everywhere in the early West, the Baptist gospel was first propagated in Indiana by
                    farmer-preachers, most of whom had crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Southern Indiana was therefore the region of greatest Baptist strength in the early
                    years and has remained so to the present time. To a greater degree than in any other early religious
                    body, the first Indiana Baptist leadership sprang from the soil, which helps account for the fact
                    that in a majority of cases the Baptists were the first to form churches in new communities. The
                    ease with which local leaders could find a following and form new Baptist congregations led, not
                    only to the rapid multiplication of Baptist churches, but also rendered difficult the achievement of
                    any large degree of unity among them. Indeed, the slightest differences often led to the division of
                    churches, and the whole of Indiana Baptist history is distressingly full of accounts of bitter
                    controversy. Indiana was an early stronghold of anti-mission sentiment, and for years the churches
                    wasted their energies in purposeless strife over that issue. In fact Indiana Baptist history is a
                    glaring example of the weakness <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-039-3-079"/> of loose organization. The
                    complete independence of the congregation, a fundamental Baptist principle, was a constant
                    temptation for the Baptists to go off in all directions.</p>
            <p>The two most interesting names in connection with Baptist beginnings in Indiana are Isaac McCoy and
                    Judge Jesse L. Holman, both of whom have been accounted worthy of inclusion in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American Biography.</hi> McCoy gained distinction because of his devotion to the
                    cause of the Indians. As a young pastor of the Maria Creek Baptist Church, McCoy stood firmly for
                    the cause of missions against an overwhelming opposition sentiment. After-establishing several
                    Baptist Indian missions, McCoy was appointed in 1830 by John C. Calhoun, then Secretary of War, as a
                    special Indian agent in assisting Indians to migrate westward. His writings on the Indian situation
                    of his days have a large historical value.</p>
            <p>Judge Holman is an excellent example of the best type of frontier lay leadership and well illustrates
                    the widespread influences exerted by men of religious character on the rude American frontier.
                    Coming to Indiana in 1810 from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> where he had read law in the office of Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, he identified himself at once with the Indiana Baptists and never permitted his
                    increasing responsibilities as legislator, circuit judge, and finally federal judge from crowding
                    out his interest in religion and education. One of the founders of Indiana University, he was also
                    prominnent in the founding of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> College; and Mr. Cady credits him also with furnishing the principal influence in the
                    founding of the General Association of Indiana Baptists.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Missionary Baptists made worthy contributions to education and founded numerous academies
                    as well as several colleges within the bounds of the state. None of the academies were well
                    supported, due to the "badly dissapated" Baptist energies. Nor have the Indiana
                    Baptists been wholehearted in the support of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, the strongest Baptist institution of collegiate rank in the state. Here again
                    lack of unity has been chiefly responsible rather than lack of interest in education.</p>
            <p>As a whole, Indiana Baptists have leaned strongly in the direction of conservatism. This is doubtless
                    chiefly due to the lack of an educated ministry and the rural character of the great majority of
                    their churches. Liberal tendencies, <pb n="298" id="VAA4025-039-3-080"/> however, have made some
                    progress since the beginning of the century. A few churches, located largely in the northern part of
                    the state, now receive members by letter from other evangelical bodies. During the fundamentalist
                    controversy of the nineteen-twenties, the Indiana Baptists were torn asunder; and a number of
                    churches withdrew all relationship from the state organizations. Others were split over the issues
                    involved. There seems to be no doubt but that the Baptists are the most conservative large
                    Protestant body within the state of Indiana. The Indiana Baptists, therefore, will not be found
                    among the "radicals," nor will they be in the vanguard of the army of reform; but
                    they will doubtless continue to stand staunchly by the old standards and the fundamental truths.</p>

            <p>Richard Lieber is known throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as the organizer, under Governor James P. Goodrich and the Act of the 1919 General
                    Assembly, of the Indiana Department of Conservation. As its director until 1933, he established the
                    principles and procedures which insured its successful operation. He developed also the system of
                    state parks which made him a national leader in the conservation movement. In a smaller circle,
                    Colonel Lieber has long been known as a profound student of the natural resources of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the proponent of sound principles for their conservation and utilization. Many
                    schemes of conservation, hastily conceived on the basis of a single observation or suggestion, have
                    produced conflicts among conservationists and have discredited the movement. (Colonel Lieber thinks
                    the double suffix in "conservationists" shows remoteness from reality; the genuine
                    workers are "conservators.") The author's approach to the discussion of
                    America's natural wealth combines both long practical experience and thorough historical
                    study; his treatment throughout is historical.</p>
            <p>Following his example, libraries and readers should add to his book the pamphlet on <hi rend="i">State Planning</hi> published <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-039-3-081"/> by the late National
                    Resources Planning Board in June, 1942 (for sale by the Superintendent of Documents in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> at thirty cents), in which Appendix B (pp. 94–134) gives an annotated list
                    of "State Conservation Legislation" prepared under Richard Lieber's
                    supervision and intended for this book but omitted owing to the exigencies of publication.</p>
            <p>The narrative of <hi rend="i">America's Natural Wealth</hi> combines a description of our
                    natural resources, a history of the treatment of our natural resources through the years of the
                    white man's occupation, a history of the conservation movement, a plea for unity among
                    conservators on a well-considered program, and suggestions for such a program.</p>
            <p>The foundation must be an efficient, unified—though not too
                    centralized—structure of government, national, state and local, and a sound policy of
                    conservation. Quite a contrast to the hundreds of semi-independent agencies and the "one
                    hundred and nine different plans of geographical subdivisions of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>" used by the various government agencies at the time of writing (probably more
                    now) ! "The administrative work of the executive branch should be carried on by a few
                    regional units, each set up to cover all the work contemplated for its region."</p>
            <p>The body of the book follows the pattern of description, history, and plea for improvement in each of
                    five chapters devoted respectively to Minerals, Water, Forests, Land, and Scenery. In the section
                    devoted to scenery, Chapter XVIII, "The Care and Feeding of Parks," recapitulating
                    Colonel Lieber's experience of many years, is really a priceless manual which should be
                    read and reread by every one in any way connected with parks. The last chapter, "Sowing and
                    Reaping," describes "Conservation on the March"; it closes with a
                    critical, i.e., an objective appreciation of the Civilian Conservation Corps, and short references
                    to the Public Works Administration and the National Resources Planning Board. An appendix of
                    fourteen pages gives a very convenient and valuable "Chronology of Events Affecting
                    Conservation of Natural Resources," beginning with "1626—<placeName>

                    "1942—Civilian Conservation Corps liquidated." There is a good
                    five-page index.</p>

                    Fortunately, they are few in number. Discriminating students of the Civil War President's
                    life will welcome it as a major contribution to Lincolniana. In reality, this fine work adds stature

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s greatness. As the authors well express it: "Many <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> admirers find it distasteful—perhaps unbelievable—to recognize in
                    their hero the shrewd practical politician that he was. But to recognize how, as a politician, he
                    utilized the patronage in holding together diverse conflicting factions in common
                    purposes—the preservation of the Union, the success of his administration, and the
                    rewarding of the party faithful—is only to enhance the greatness of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>With scholarly thoroughness, the authors describe how <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> handled the patronage from 1861 to 1865, how he awarded the government jobs, big and
                    small, to the eager horde of office-seekers who besieged him from the moment of his election to the
                    day of his death. Every aspect of the Federal patronage is discussed. Through the story move Cabinet
                    members, Supreme Court justices, generals, ambassadors and consuls, postmasters and paymasters, port
                    collectors and marshals. Great national figures appear, Seward, Chase, Stanton, Weed, and a host of
                    minor men whose importance was that they were the bone and sinew of the Republican machine. The
                    authors conclude that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> accepted the spoils system. So did every other political leader of the day. The
                    accession of the Republicans to power in 186] "was the occasion for the most sweeping
                    removal of federal officeholders up to that time in American history." No President was
                    ever confronted by a more difficult patronage situation, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> handled it as wisely as any human could. His was the terribly difficult task of holding
                    together the most heterogenous party in our political history. An adroit patronage policy was one of
                    the factors that enabled him to keep his party intact. And by preserving the Republican
                    organization, the war party, he helped to preserve the Union.</p>
            <p>A tremendous amount of research was necessary to produce <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-039-3-083"/> this
                    book. The information the authors needed was scattered through an unusually wide number of sources,
                    some of them painfully obscure. It must have been particularly difficult to run down the careers of
                    the scores of minor figures who sought and obtained office from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. That Professors Carman and Luthin did their task well is attested by a twenty-five
                    page bibliography.</p>
            <p>The authors have invested their story with significance. The information is massive, but the book
                    never becomes a mere catalogue of names and facts. The literary style is marred by frequent use of
                    such awkward phrases as "we now turn our attention to" and "as we have
                    just observed." There are a few typographical slips and factual errors which alert critics
                    will call to the attention of the authors. These minor flaws, however, detract in no way from the
                    excellence of the book.</p>

            <p>Five essays plus two tall tales, which were not originally written for publication, compose this
                    little book on Indiana life prior to the Civil War by the late Logan Esarey of Indiana University.
                    The essays are "The First Inhabitants," "A Log Cabin in the
                    Clearing," "The Indiana Home," "Farm Life in the
                    Fifties," and "The Settler Becomes a Citizen." The two tales are
                    "The Bewitching of Blackstock" and "The Bull Frogs of Reily
                    Hole."</p>
            <p>The book is a blending of miscellaneous notes which were used in class lectures and in talks before
                    historical groups. Any of Dr. Esarey's former students can read the book and have
                    long-forgotten places, old familiar phrases and people brought back. The former student will be able
                    to review his acquaintance with Esarey and with Indiana history as only Esarey could interpret it.</p>
            <p>Here is history made palatable, history as intimate and disarming as the tales around the baseburner
                    on a winter evening at the village store, and yet as true as a long life of devoted and exacting
                    scholarship could make it. It is not a history in the accepted sense; it is something much <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-039-3-084"/> more. It is drama. Esarey has done what Hamlet told his players
                    to do—he has "held the mirror up to nature."</p>
            <p>The historian will not be disappointed, for historically, the book is accurate. The homely phrases of
                    the pioneer are preserved and, what is more rare, the Hoosier dialect is presented in its true form.
                    What he tells is not a formal story of how the settlers came and took up land, planted, built
                    churches and towns and roads, formed governments, and grew wealthy. All of this emerges from his
                    pages, but it is not the soul of his book. What he has captured and put into this slender volume is
                    a people and their epic—an epic salted with the authentic vernacular of the Border and
                    moving with the quiet power of men and women who were big in love and laughter, in work and in
                    faith.</p>
            <p>There is nothing anemic about his people (you know they are <hi rend="i">his</hi>) or about his
                    history. It sweeps you along with the lusty humor of the hills and the heart-catching
                    self-sufficiency of folk who fought, worked, and laughed as if they meant it. Such a book is like a
                    breath of fresh air in a stuffy night.</p>

            <p>Judge James Hall was an important man in the history of the Middle West, 1820–1868; he was
                    also an interesting one—soldier, lawyer, judge (once a judge, always a judge in the
                    West), politician, editor, novelist, poet, banker, but above all, advocate of the West. The student
                    of the history of the region might well mark the progress of his work by the frequency of his
                    contacts with James Hall. Yet a century has relegated the man to an undeserved obscurity.</p>
            <p>In the average college course on the history of the West, Hall is conspicuous by his absence; in two

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he edited the <hi rend="i">Western Monthly Magazine</hi> for four more years. The
                    next thirty years of his life were devoted to banking and business, but his pen was never idle.
                    Among his more important works were <hi rend="i">Letters for the West</hi> (1828), <hi rend="i">Legends of the West</hi> (1832), <hi rend="i">Sketches of History, Life and Manners in the
                    West</hi> (1835), <hi rend="i">Statistics of the West</hi> (1836), <hi rend="i">Notes on the Western
                        States</hi> (1838) and, with Thomas McKenney, <hi rend="i">History of the Indian Tribes of North
                        America</hi> (1836–1844). In addition he wrote one novel, some fifty tales, and quite
                    a bit of poetry. Many of these works, as are the two periodicals, are fairly rare items today.</p>
            <p>Professor Flanagan attempts no complete narrative life of Hall. Twenty pages cover his youth; the
                    lawyer and journalist are sketched in fifteen more. Brief chapters cover the political and editing
                    periods. In all these the chronology of Hall's writings is clear. The meat of the book lies
                    in the chapters on Hall as "Romancer and Historian," as "Library
                    Critic," as "Storyteller," and in the chapter on "Characteristic
                    Ideas." Little of significance is missed. The vigorous editor lambasting at English
                    travellers who tried to give America a black eye; judging the merits of literary works on the basis
                    of their contributors to morality and patriotism; his frank and at times blatant pleading for the
                    West; his advocacy of a truly American literature; his interest in Indians, the public land
                    question, agriculture, trade, transportation, and finance; his second-rate novel and tales (first
                    rate only in the settings, lesser characters and fairly authentic dialect) and his third-rate poetry
                    (often used as filler in his magazine) are all clearly and fairly treated. Not to be overlooked is
                    the complete bibliography of Hall's writings. The documentation is adequate and correct in
                    form.</p>
            <p>The author modestly states his purpose as that of presenting an adequate picture of a man
                    "not a major figure in American history." Who knows for sure who the major figures
                    are? Certainly not always the historian. For a few minutes of physical bravery (very common in this
                    world) or a few weeks of hardship and the possession of a certain type of leadership, the George
                    Rogers Clarks, the Waynes, or the Harrisons become major figures. The men who help mold the
                    thinking, record the history, pioneer in <pb n="304" id="VAA4025-039-3-086"/> medicine, build the
                    schools, found the banks, and carry on the commerce too often get lost in the shuffle. In a
                    generation which saw Daniel Drake, Caleb Atwater, Timothy Flint, John James Audubon, Mann <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Henry R. Schoolcraft, William D. Gallagher, to name a few, living and writing on the
                    West, Judge Hall occupied a position second to none.</p>
            <p>If he be a second-rate personage, Professor Flanagan has done a first-rate study of him. Sad, but
                    true, the modern historians of the Middle West have neglected the early historians (who also helped
                    make the history) of the region. It is to the students of literature—the Rusks, Dondores,
                    Hazards, and Flanagans—that their students must turn for help.</p>
            <p>Could the reviewer have this book rewritten to order, he would specify another hundred pages and more
                    emphasis upon Hall as historian and publicist. The men of this period has as broad a concept of
                    history as none but a few have today. The Turner viewpoint of half a century later, the
                    "New History" of James H. Robinson, Harry Elmer Barnes <hi rend="i">et al</hi>,
                    the social history and economic history but recently discovered was all old stuff to these men of a
                    century ago—to Flint and Hall particularly. He would also specify more liberal quotations
                    from Hall's writings. The hefty prose of that day can not be transferred by summary or
                    paraphrase; least of all, that of James Hall. Only first hand can the reader get the essence of the
                    man and his thought. But the reviewer is prejudiced in favor of Hall; in fact, he has long been a
                    Hall fan. Naturally he is prejudiced in favor of any historical job well done, so much so that he
                    passes the opportunity to call attention to a few doubtful statements on history not germane to the
                    study of James Hall.</p>
            <p>The book is attractively printed and well edited. It makes a neat as well as indispensable addition
                    to the library on Midwest history.</p>

            <p>This significant volume on the civilization of the South by the eminent authority on colonial <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> should be read by every student of early American history. The author's <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-039-3-087"/> early writings have already marked him as one of the leading
                    historians of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Pointing out the riches bestowed by nature upon the South, Professor Wertenbaker declared them to
                    have become the curse of the region because they led to an extravagant wastage of soil and the
                    introduction of slavery. He described the Old South as made up of five sub-divisions: the tobacco
                    country, the mercantile section, the pine belt, the rice and indigo region, and the back country.
                    Much of the volume, however, is devoted to describing the civilization of the two staple-producing
                    regions and the back country and the conflict that developed between the two major types of
                    life—that of the planter and that of the farmer.</p>
            <p>In the Tidewater of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="mdu">Maryland</country>
                    </placeName> there arose the earlier white civilization of the English colonies. Chapters on the
                    intellectual life of the tobacco aristocrat and his architectural activities indicate sources
                    utilized extensively by the author. The colonial aristocracy was not a transplanted one but a
                    product of the plantation, the accumulation of wealth, and the command of servants and slaves.
                    English influence in shaping the intellectual life of the planter was pronounced in education,
                    literature, architecture, arts, and religion; but it was modified by the plantation system and
                    isolation. A highly significant story is told of the development of architecture in the colonial
                    period.</p>
            <p>The settlement of the Piedmont produced a new society based upon that of the Tidewater but differing
                    because of isolation and the costs and difficulties of transportation. Soil exhaustion and virgin
                    western soils induced a further westward migration that also lessened the ties with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. A significant clash of cultures occurred west of the Blue Ridge where Cohees, the
                    non-English immigrants coming down the valley, met the Tuckahoes, who were the Virginians from east
                    of the mountains. The Germans in the valley surrendered many customs but adhered tenaciously to
                    their own system of agriculture. The Scotch-Irish, too, gave up much but did not surrender their
                    Presbyterianism. Neither accepted completely the plantation system or its slave labor. The Tuckahoe
                    often gave up his more wasteful agricultural methods.</p>
            <p>The lack of a large artisan class was a deterrent to democracy in the South, while the rise of
                    "Mansions on the <pb n="306" id="VAA4025-039-3-088"/> Ashley" greatly strengthened
                    the aristocracy of the South and also increased the force of English influence. The land system of
                    the Southern colonies was unquestionably "second only to the slave system in building up
                    the aristocratic type of society"; but migration westward seriously interfered with
                    tenantry, one of the features of an unsound system.</p>
            <p>The work is attractively printed and bound, but the illustrations must be noted particularly because
                    of the fifty-six beautiful and instructive photographs. Readers may differ on certain controversial
                    points, but errors of fact seem to be unusually few. Samuel Doah (pp. 210, 312) should have been
                    Samuel Doak, but such exceptions are hardly worth noticing. In the earlier volume in this series,
                    the emphasis upon architecture seemed an overemphasis without adequate interpretative connection
                    with the history of the region, but surely this cannot be alleged against the present
                    work—a very significant work.</p>

                    <hi rend="i">Genealogical Material in the Indiana State Library</hi>
                </head>
            <byline>BY ANNA POUCHER</byline>
            <p>The collection of material in the Genealogy Section of the Indiana State Library constitutes a
                    reference and research library from which nothing circulates. In order that the public may keep in
                    touch with its nature and growth, occasional lists of its additions have been published in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi> The last previous list appeared in March, 1941.
                    Accessions since then have been so numerous that only a general outline, or summary, can be given at
                    this time.</p>
            <p rend="center">FAMILY HISTORIES</p>
            <p>Family histories, naturally, are in large proportion to other specific material. Within the last few
                    months, over two hundred of these have been received in book, pamphlet, manuscript, and chart form.
                    These range from manuscripts of only a few pages to large and extensive volumes, and have been
                    acquired through donation and through purchase. It has been found that the average compiler of a
                    genealogy is more than willing to place a copy of his work in a library where proper attention will
                    be given to its use and preservation. Through solicitation on the part of the order librarian of the
                    Indiana State Library, who is on the alert for new publications, a number of family histories, some
                    of which might otherwise have been prohibitive, have been added to the collection. These have come
                    from twenty-eight states, aside from Indiana. A constant request on the part of the Genealogy
                    Section is that all persons compiling histories of Indiana families place copies in this library.</p>
            <p>The library has obtained a number of outstanding genealogies through purchase; and by consulting book
                    catalogues and book sales, it has been able to secure many of these at reduced rates. Since the size
                    of a compilation is not always a gauge for its value, no attempt is made in this article to present
                    a discriminating list; but even the smallest manuscript is brought out under the family name in the
                    genealogy <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-039-3-092"/> catalogue. One interesting acquisition might be
                    mentioned, and that is the copy of the <hi rend="i">Genealogy of Samuel and Hannah Stebbins</hi>,
                    1707–1771, published at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, 1771, and purported to be the first genealogy brought out in printed form.</p>
            <p rend="center">LOCAL HISTORIES AND RECORDS</p>
            <p>Locality has been the basis for the cataloguing, shelving, and practical use of the Genealogy
                    collection. Since March, 1941, fully one hundred and seventy-five county and town histories (not
                    including the number of volumes in sets) and special records of a local nature, involving
                    twenty-four states, have been added. This is exclusive of pamphlet material. Special records include
                    vital records (births, marriages, deaths), cemetery and church records, probate records,
                    directories, and miscellaneous material. A number of gifts of local material have been received.</p>
            <p rend="center">FOREIGN MATERIAL</p>
            <p>Although it has seemed advisable for the present to concentrate on material dealing with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, the foreign collection is growing perceptibly. The series of the Harleian Society
                    Visitations and Parish Registers, instituted some time ago, is proving valuable, and volumes are
                    being added as published. Some separate county or shire histories of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> have been acquired. A most noteworthy gift is that of five rare volumes published in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and dealing with Leeds and Yorkshire. Another much prized gift is the copy of the <hi rend="i">Parish and Town of Enniskillen, <placeName>
                            <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>

                            <country reg="enk">England</country>
                        </placeName>;</hi> a late edition of <hi rend="i">O'Hart's Irish

                    and additional material on Scottish clans.</p>
            <p rend="center">PATRIOTIC AND HISTORICAL SOCIETIES</p>
            <p>It is a source of satisfaction that the patriotic and historical societies of Indiana have shown a
                    constant interest in placing valuable publications and records in the Genealogy Section.</p>
            <p>The Society of Colonial Dames is maintaining its custom of contributing memorial volumes in honor of
                    its deceased members. Two of its recent additions are <hi rend="i">Church</hi>

                    some records of the General Council of the Society, some special state publications, and the new <hi rend="i">First Supplement to the 1922 Index of Ancestors and Roll of Members</hi>, published in
                    1941.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Chapter of the Daughters of Colonial Wars, organized in 1939, already has contributed its
                    volume, <hi rend="i">Membership List and Index to Ancestors</hi>, published in 1941.</p>
            <p>Through the Genealogy Committee of the Indiana Daughters of the American Revolution, with
                    subcommittees in its various chapters, a large number of genealogical compilations, including Bible,
                    cemetery, church, lineage, marriage, probate, and miscellaneous records, have been added. These have
                    been received from chapters in the following counties: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Howard, Jefferson, Jennings, Johnson, <placeName>

                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>, and Vigo. A few separate family histories compiled by members have been received in
                    addition to a volume of histories of Indiana chapters compiled in 1942. The Caroline Scott Harrison
                    Chapter, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is preparing a copy of its index to members and ancestors, which will be placed in
                    this library.</p>
            <p>Since 1941, the Indiana chapter of the Daughters of Founders and Patriots has added three volumes of
                    Bolton's <hi rend="i">Founders and Patriots</hi> and three volumes of Banks' <hi rend="i">History of Martha's Vineyard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sons of the American Revolution made a gift to the library of the book, <hi rend="i">Henry Adams

                        </placeName>
               </hi>, a genealogy which, it is said, should be in every reputable library. It has
                    also placed on deposit the lineage books of its members and other records.</p>
            <p>The Society of Mayflower Descendants, which has its library collection on deposit in the Genealogy
                    Section, has added two memorial volumes on the Alford and Alvord families, and also the genealogical
                    history of Edgar Hanks Evans.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Historical Society has been the largest contributor as to the number of records placed in
                    the Genealogy Section. Its Committee of Pioneer Cemeteries and <pb n="312" id="VAA4025-039-3-094"/>
                    Churches works in nearly every county in the state. Their reports are given according to calendar
                    year. In 1941 two hundred and nine cemeteries in twenty-three counties were reported on. In 1942
                    there were compilations from two hundred and fifty-five cemeteries in twenty-four counties. Itemized
                    lists appeared in the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi> of March, 1942, and March, 1943.</p>
            <p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS MATERIAL</p>
            <p>Two additional census volumes should receive attention. One, <hi rend="i">The First Census of <placeName>

            <p>The Genealogy Section has always stressed the value of indexes and guides and watches for and strives
                    to acquire any which might be practical and desirable. It does much indexing and analyzing of its
                    own. The Library has subscribed to the <hi rend="i">American Genealogical Index</hi> from its
                    beginning. Compiled under the direction of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>

                    </placeName>, this came out first in card form and is now in consolidated index volumes. Its
                    indexing is by family name and covers important publications dealing with specified families. Volume
                    six has just been received and includes family names beginning with the letters Cl. A most valuable
                    bibliographical work is Passano's <hi rend="i">Index of Source Records of <placeName>
                            <country reg="mdu">Maryland</country>
                        </placeName>, Genealogical, Biographical, Historical</hi>, published in 1940. The Library
                    subscribes to a duplicate copy of the April number of the <hi rend="i">American Genealogist</hi>, in
                    order that the pages containing Jacobus' <hi rend="i">Index to Genealogical
                    Periodicals</hi> (supplementary to his volume published in 1932) may be clipped and added with other
                    index numbers in a temporary binder. The Genealogy Section also maintains a temporary index to
                    current periodicals. Colored illustrations of coats of arms in the <hi rend="i">Americana</hi> are
                    indexed, and references are made to these under family name in the Genealogy catalogue. The
                    Genealogy Section has almost completed the indexing of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> pension record for 1840, the volumes of the 1835 record were indexed some time ago.</p>
            <p>A patron of the library continues the indexing, by cards, of the scrapbooks containing the
                    genealogical clippings from the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times.</hi> The indexing of Indiana county histories, which was carried on for some
                    months in the Indiana Division of the library by the Works Progress Administration of Indiana, has
                    been discontinued. Counties were taken in alphabetical order and the last consolidated index volume
                    covers <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jennings County</region>
                    </placeName>. Many of the family histories and county histories of other states in the Genealogy
                    room are being <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-039-3-096"/> analyzed, so far as time will permit, and
                    analytical cards filed in the Genealogy catalogue.</p>
            <p>The policy of the Genealogy Section has been to direct the use of the material in the Genealogy room.
                    In its correspondence, it attempts to answer definite requests, particularly those pertaining to
                    Indiana connections. An especial effort is made to furnish information which can be obtained only
                    from Indiana records in this library. Sources of information are suggested whenever expedient. The
                    Indiana Division which adjoins the Genealogy room is most co-operative as to its material and
                    service from its staff. The Daily Register in the Genealogy room shows that persons from
                    twenty-three states used the room during the last year. Between thirty and forty states were
                    represented in the correspondence. It should be remembered that the Genealogy Section is not merely
                    a place where one can search for connections in one's family. It is becoming more and more
                    a repository and a depository for valuable Indiana records and its prime purpose is to make them
                    available for use and to guard their preservation.</p>

            <head>OLD GOSHEN CHURCH AND CEMETERY</head>
            <byline>Contributed By FREDERICK P. GRIFFIN</byline>
            <p>By an act of the 1943 General Assembly, the Conservation Commission was authorized to receive,
                    accept, administer, and maintain the Old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> Baptist Church and Cemetery in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName> as a public memorial to the pioneer settlers of Indiana. Built of massive oak and
                    poplar logs, the church building is still in comparatively good condition after standing one hundred
                    and twenty years.</p>
            <p>It was in the first decade of the nineteenth century that Squire <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>, brother of Daniel, crossed the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> from his home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and established a new home some six miles north of the river in what is now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName>. With him were his four sons, Moses, Isaiah, Enoch, and Jonathan, and five sons of his
                    cousin. Under the strong arms of these sturdy men, the wilderness soon began to take on the aspects
                    of a settled community. A mill was built for grinding the grain of the neighborhood. When <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName> was organized in 1808, Moses <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> was appointed one of the judges.</p>
            <p>Religious services were, no doubt, held in the various homes of the neighborhood at first, but it was
                    not long before the building of a church was discussed. The building now to be preserved by the
                    state is thought to have been completed in 1813.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> It stands on State Highway 11,
                    about two and one-half miles north of Laconia. Moses <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>, on whose land it was erected, deeded the land to the church trustees in 1821; he also
                    took a leading part in its construction. The Reverend David A. Leonard who died in 1819 and was
                    buried in the church cemetery may have been the first pastor.</p>
            <p>After being used by the Baptists for sixty or seventy years, the building was leased for brief
                    periods to Dunkard and United Brethren congregations. In the forties it served as a school house.

                            records were destroyed by fire. County histories, deed records, and a newspaper article by
                            John M. Dannenfelser, Jr. (clipping in Corydon Public Library) were the principal sources

                    holes chipped in the west wall indicate the location of the shelf upon which the pupils did their
                    writing. The original floor was of wide rough boards placed on slab sills of beech. A balcony, built
                    about seven feet above the lower section, extended two-thirds of the way across the building from
                    north to south. The building was repaired in 1913, but little change was made in its outward
                    appearance.</p>
            <p>In the large cemetery adjoining the church, many of the early settlers of the neighborhood are
                    buried. Many graves are marked only by a rough slab with no name. All the inscriptions which were
                    legible were copied in 1940 by Samuel P. Hayes, of Corydon, and myself. The original inscriptions
                    have been shortened and abbreviations used to save space in printing.</p>
