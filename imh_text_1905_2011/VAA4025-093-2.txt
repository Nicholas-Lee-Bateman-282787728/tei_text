            Civil War Letters as Historical Sources

                    Mother, father, brother, sister, wife, sweet-heart, keep that bundle sacredly! Each word will be
                        historic, each line will be invaluable. When peace has restored the ravages of war, and our
                        nation[']s grandeur has made this struggle the most memorable of those great conflicts
                        by which ideas are rooted into society, these pen-pictures of the humblest events, the merest
                        routine details of the life led in winning national unity and freedom, will be priceless. Not
                        for the historian's sake alone, do I say, keep those letters, but for your sakes who
                        receive them and ours who write them. The next skirmish may stop our pulses forever, and our
                        letters full of love for you, will be our only legacy beside that of having died in a noble
                        cause. And should we survive the war with health and limb uninjured, or bowed with sickness or
                        crippled with wounds, those letters will be dear mementos to us of dangers past, of trials
                        borne, of privations suffered, of comrades beloved. Keep our letters then, and write to us all
                        the home news and home "gossip." Bid us God speed-speak kindly, loving,
                        courageous words to us. If you can't be Spartans-and we don't want you to
                        be-be "lovers, countrymen and friends." So shall our feet fall lighter, and
                        our sabres heavier.

            This admonition neatly summarizes the meaning and importance that many Hoosiers assigned to the
                    letters sent to and from the front lines of the Civil War. Indiana's soldiers were very
                    conscious that they were involved in momentous historical events and that the letters, diaries, and
                    memoirs they wrote would form part of the chronicle of these events. They and their correspondents
                    were also fully aware that letters from home were an important support for their morale. And
                    everyone understood that the letters sent back and forth provided the soldiers and the loved ones
                    they left behind with a way to maintain and express their ties of affection.
            Today, more than 130 years after the end of the war, privately held collections of Civil War
                    materials provide those who possess them with a sense of their family heritage and pride in the
                    sacrifices made by their ancestors. They are also important primary sources for historians. They are
                    useful in the study not only of battle experiences

                     and camp life but also the general political and social history
                    of the middle nineteenth century.
            Civil War letters, diaries, and memoirs are most commonly used as primary sources for narratives of
                    battles and campaigns or for works describing the social makeup of the armies. As is evident in the
                    letters Vivian Zollinger has discovered, soldiers filled their correspondence with descriptions of
                    battles, camp life, training, troop movements, and other experiences directly related to the war.
                    Historians have used these descriptions to great effect for many years. Anyone who has read such a
                    war narrative as Bruce Catton's A Stillness at 
                            Appomattox
                        
                or such a descriptive study of the troops as Bell I. Wiley's The Life of Billy Yank knows the richness of detail and understanding that a good
                    historian can derive from the writings left behind by the soldiers.1
            
            More recently, the written record of Civil War soldiers has become a fertile source for practitioners
                    of the "New Military History." Scholars using this approach are preoccupied with
                    the motivations of soldiers and the experience and effects of combat. The Civil War is an especially
                    fruitful field for such historians because of the voluminous surviving primary sources and because
                    the army did not censor the letters of Union soldiers. These combatants were free to speak their
                    minds and reveal their emotions concerning combat and the cause in which they had enlisted. The
                    value of Civil War sources for this new approach to military history can be seen in such works as
                    Gerald Linderman's Embattled Courage, Reid Mitchell's Civil War Soldiers, James McPherson's What They Fought
                    For, and Joseph T. Glatthaar's The March to the Sea and Beyond.

            While military historians, whether old or new, continue to make extensive use of the writings of
                    soldiers, political and social historians have not yet adequately exploited these sources. The new
                    military historians have used some of the political material for what it can tell about the
                    soldiers' motivations for serving, but political historians have not yet meaningfully
                    engaged this material. The amount of political content in the correspondence to and from the front
                    varies considerably from family to family, but taken as a whole Civil War letters, diaries, and
                    memoirs provide a unique opportunity for historians to read what large numbers of
                    mid-nineteenth-century common men and common women thought about the issues of the day. Section four
                    of Zollinger's collection provides some idea of the range of views and

                     attitudes to be found. In addition, these and many other
                    Hoosier Civil War letters provide a sense of the intensity of political animosity in Indiana as
                    partisanship reached new levels of passion in 1863 and 1864. The apprehension of possible civil war
                    in Indiana was a sentiment that was pervasive not only in 
                        Owen County
                     but all across the state.
            Social historians similarly have failed to exploit adequately Civil War letters as a source of
                    information for their studies. Granted, they may have to read through much camp life and battle
                    material to find that information, but their efforts will be rewarded. Scattered throughout Hoosier
                    Civil War correspondence are all kinds of details that collectively provide a window through which
                    historians can view the lives of the common men and women of mid-nineteenth-century Indiana. Used in
                    conjunction with the manuscript census, marriage records, newspapers, and other such records and
                    sources, Civil War letters provide historians with the opportunity to reconstruct much of the
                    content and dynamics of life in the rural communities and small towns of Indiana: the gendered tasks
                    of everyday life; moneylending between friends and relatives; the sharing of work at harvest and
                    other times of peak labor demand; female networks; the preoccupation of Hoosiers with illness,
                    injury, and infirmities; individual and groups acts designed to support the war effort; marketing
                    and economic strategies; and formal social events and activities. The letters that Zollinger
                    presents here are particularly helpful in recreating life in rural neighborhoods, because she so
                    often is able to include letters from more than one family in one rural community. Thus her letters
                    provide an unusually good sense of the dense kin and friendship relationships existing in rural 
                        Owen County
                     and among many of the soldiers from those neighborhoods who joined and fought together.
                    So many spoken things that historians would never hear-from the affectionate words of husbands and
                    wives, to boys flirting with and attempting to court Emerine Hicks, to neighborhood gossip, to
                    political and military rumors-are preserved here in written words because the war separated members
                    of closeknit neighborhoods.3
            
            There is, of course, more to the letters and diaries of Civil War soldiers and their families than
                    useful bits of information for historians. While many letters are mundane descriptions of camp life
                    or of farming activities back home, there are others that are filled with intrinsic human drama and
                    poignancy. One finds touching romance, 
                  
                     3 John Mack Faragher has taken advantage of the content of the letters
                            of some midwestern families separated by the migration of some of their members on the 
                                Oregon
                             Trail to help create one of the best brief descriptions and analyses of life in
                            the rural Midwest in the mid-nineteenth century as well as the experience of families
                            traveling on wagon trains. His work provides a model for historians seeking to distill
                            social history from the letters of families separated by war. John Mack Faragher, Women and Men on the Overland Trail (
                                New Haven
                            , Conn., 1979).
               
                     as a husband and wife separated by war express their love and
                    longing for each other. One finds the pathos of a soldier trying to tell as gently as he can the
                    parents of his friend that their son and his comrade is dead. And once in a while one finds the
                    description of a peculiarly poignant moment in the life of a young soldier. Zollinger includes such
                    a description in section three in Vint Anderson's account of how his drunken revelry was
                    abruptly halted by the look in the eyes of one southern woman bystander.
            While there is much to be learned and enjoyed from the kind of sources Zollinger presents here, one
                    must be aware of the ways in which they can mislead as well as inform. For example, despite the
                    large number of Civil War letters, diaries, and memoirs that have survived, one has to question how
                    representative their contents are of the views of the people of the areas from which their writers
                    came or of the men of the units in which their authors served. The collections that have survived
                    are disproportionately those of officers, married men, members of families long established in a
                    given area, and Republicans. Although some of the letters presented by Zollinger contain criticisms
                    of the 
                        Lincoln
                     administration, one would not get the impression from them or from other collections of 
                        Owen County
                     letters that a large majority of the voters of the county voted against the Republicans
                    and their policies in 1862 and 1864.4 Likewise, while many of the letters
                    presented here are from the correspondence between a husband and wife, it should not be assumed that
                    a large proportion of the volunteers were married men. In fact, many married men did not volunteer.
                    For instance, of the married male residents of draft age who have biographies in Charles
                    Blanchard's 1884 history of 
                        Owen County
                    , nearly two-thirds did not serve.5 Similarly misleading is the
                    impression left by the letters that the companies from Owen consisted only of men drawn from local
                    families. As was typical of units across the state, a number of Owen's recruits were highly
                    mobile farm laborers who just happened to be in the county when they volunteered. For example, more
                    than one-third of the volunteers in Company I, 19th Indiana Regiment of Volunteers, and Company
                        
                  
                     4 This comment is based on Zollinger's materials and two
                            other major collections by

                    census was taken.6
            
            Another caveat to keep in mind as one reads Civil War letters is that correspondents may have
                    restrained themselves when writing. They were conscious that they were writing for the historical
                    record and that they were writing to loved ones who might become unduly upset by the content of
                    letters. In fact, one of the most striking things about the letters of Hoosier soldiers is how
                    little of the horror and gore of war these epistles communicated to the folks back home. Although
                    battles are described in general terms and men dying of disease are noted, little of the horror of
                    what the writer experienced is ever conveyed. The letters of Andrew Bush on the following pages are
                    atypical in their unusually graphic content. One must also suspect that writers often understated or
                    omitted misgivings about such things as the war and government policies, the intensity of vice in
                    the camps, and the difficulties of keeping a farm operating with a husband absent.7
            
            Even if Civil War letters, diaries, and memoirs do not tell everything and may not represent
                    everybody, they still say a great deal about the lives of a great many people. Zollinger's
                    discovery of so many heretofore unknown Civil War letters in her home county suggests that even
                    after more than one and a quarter centuries of research there are still many Civil War primary
                    documents that are unknown to historians. For those who possess the letters and diaries of a Civil
                    War ancestor, they are not just primary documents but heirlooms that are an important part of their
                    heritage. Historians should be grateful to the 
                        Owen County
                     residents who have chosen to share their family heirlooms in this issue of the Indiana Magazine of History and to Vivian Zollinger for locating and preparing
                    these materials for publication. Historians can only hope that other local historians will attempt
                    to duplicate Zollinger's efforts and that they will find donators as generous as those she
                    found in

                        men and noncommissioned officers in Company I, 19th, who listed their residence as 
                            Owen County
                         could be located in U.S., Eighth Census, 1860, Population Schedules for 
                            Owen County
                        . The figures for Company H, 97th, were thirty-two (34.0 percent) of ninety-four.
                        The 19th was recruited in July, 1861, and the 97th in August, 1862. A few of the men who did not
                        appear in the census were probably former Owen residents who returned home to enlist with
                        brothers or other relatives still living in the county. Lists of the recruits for these two
                        companies were taken from William H. H. Terrell, Report of the Adjutant General of
                            Indiana (8 vols.,

                        soldiers' letters were often not simple recountings of events but were instead
                        narratives shaped by writing conventions, the need to appear manly, the desire to shield the

            A study of early 
                        Owen County
                    , Indiana, would be limited largely to cold data and legends were it not for rare,
                    faded, fold-worn letters. The letters in this collection were written by 
                        Owen County
                     soldiers during the Civil War-letters to the folks back home. Stylized formality did
                    little to veil the men's loneliness, weariness, and pain. From their words we know them.
                    The soldiers' descendants hesitated in bringing forth these treasures to be copied. Some
                    refused to share even a reading of their letters. Their pause is easy to understand. The words were
                    personal, meant only for loved ones.
            Pockets of 
                        Owen County
                     were first settled by clans from the backcountry of 
                  Virginia, North
                    Carolina
               , eastern 
                        Kentucky
                    , and 
                        Tennessee
                    . By the time Indiana achieved statehood in 1819, settlers had begun to take up land in
                    parts of 
                        Owen County
                    . Stories exist of men visiting these wooded hills, walking back home to gather up their
                    families, belongings, and livestock, and then returning before winter. The settlers brought their
                    customs as well. What is more, they brought their courage against hardship, loyalty to kin, and
                    suspicion of outsiders. They brought their fundamental faith in God and their passion for freedom.
            A few decades later a sizable migration from eastern 
                        Ohio
                     peopled some parts of the western side of the county. Many of the families that came at
                    this time were only a generation or two removed from 
                        Germany
                     and adhered to their old language and customs within cohesive communities.1

            By the outbreak of the Civil War, over 2,500 dwellings dotted 
                        Owen County
                    . So many of the families in those homes were related to their neighbors, however, that
                    ties of responsibility and loyalty wove them into far fewer social units, groups of related
                        families.2 There were the Williams, Dyer, Hines, and Jean group in
                    southeastern Jefferson Township; the Troth, Biddle, and Criss group of 
                        Lafayette
                     Township; and the Hicks, Beaman, 
                        Jordan
                    , and Haltom neighborhood in Morgan and Jackson townships. Individuals selected their
                    friends and spouses among their neighbors, people with whom they shared work, attended church, and
                    went to school. Imbedded traditions of religion, music, and dialect united these families even
                    beyond blood ties. Those traditions persist to this day. Descendants of some of the original
                    settlers are still represented in their neighborhoods. Kinship and local customs were reflected in
                    the Civil War writings of the men of 
                        Owen County
                    .
            Men from throughout the county volunteered as the first companies organized at the beginning of the
                    war. From the vicinity of 
                        Jordan
                     Village, Atkinsonville, and the Carolina Church came Ara Fraizer of the 59th Regiment
                    and his future brothers-in-law David and William Hunsicker. Ara was a son of Abner and Rachel
                    Fraizer, pioneers in that area. Soldiers Alvin Beaman and Moses Hewitt were among the
                    Fraizers' neighbors. Another neighbor, Nathan C. Hicks, was the third child of Jacob and
                    Anna Beaman Hicks and the older brother of Emerine, who appears to have warmed the hearts of more
                    than one lonely soldier. Close relatives of the Hicks family, Reuben and Nancy Beaman Jordan, saw
                    five sons, three sons-in-law, and one grandson go to war. Three sons and the grandson were killed.
                    John Ruble's letters to his wife in that corner of the county express a common concern of
                    soldiers, that their farms remain productive during their absence. Andrew Jackson rushed to join the
                    14th Regiment, was a nurse in an army hospital, joined the 4th Artillery, was shot in the thigh at 
                        Chancellorsville
                     in 1863, and was detailed to a hospital in 
                        Washington
                    , D.C. His wife was Susan Cooksey, who became an activist for the Union cause in the 
                        Jordan
                     Village neighborhood.
            James Robinson, David Johnson, and John and Nathan Troth came from 
                        Lafayette
                     Township. Irish-born Robinson had some experience in military recruiting before he
                    gathered up Company H, 97th Regiment of Volunteers. Governor James Whitcomb had commissioned

            The Williams brothers-William, Daniel, John, Josiah, and James-were sons of William F. and Mary
                    Williams of southeastern Jefferson Township. Their neighbor Edward Hines joined Daniel and Josiah in
                    Company F, 97th Regiment, the company their neighbor Zachariah Dean recruited. Also among those who
                    came from farms southwest of Freedom was 
                        Fenton
                     Dean, who enlisted after his son, John, was killed, and the McKee family, who saw seven
                    sons go to war. It was a tightly knit community of caring, hard-working families whose descendants
                    still live on their land.
            Descendants of the Bush and Hilligas brothers from the Stockton neighborhood count among their
                    memorabilia a collection of letters chronicling three years of the war as well as a post-war
                    migration to 
                        Nebraska
                    . Those letters or parts of them tell of the experiences of the two sets of brothers and
                    account for friends from their Jefferson Township neighborhood.
            A rich personal history of an extended pioneer family from the 
                        Quincy
                     area can be found in the recollections of Harrison Lyon, one of the three soldier sons
                    of Valentine and Mary Payne Lyon, and in the memoirs of Vincent Anderson, son of Eli and Elizabeth
                    Payne Anderson. All three Anderson sons served in the Union army, leaving their one sister to help
                    the folks at home. They farmed and operated a store in 
                        Quincy
                    . The Paynes were among the earliest 
                        Owen County
                     residents. William Payne married Amma Beem, youngest child of pioneer Daniel Beem and
                    aunt of Captain David E. Beem, who organized Company H, 14th Regiment.
            Most of the men whose letters appear in this collection farmed family-owned land. They were well
                    acquainted with rigorous toil and hardship. Some had learned about war from their
                    grandfathers' stories, embellished perhaps, of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.
                    They were not afraid to step forward when the call came for troops. They may have been afraid not to
                    volunteer. Pride and competition with their peers probably contributed to the remarkable rush to
                    enlist in those first units organized in the county.
            On Monday, April 15, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for 75,000
                    three-month volunteers to defend the integrity of the nation. The same day, a decisive reply came
                    from Governor Oliver P. Morton, who would earn the title of the great "War

                The next day in 
                        Owen County
                     David E. Beem announced a public meeting at the courthouse to be held on Friday, April
                    19, to organize a company of volunteers. As Beem described in a later account, 
                        Owen County
                     men immediately began to sign up, some even before the meeting was held. Another
                    meeting at Gosport recruited still more men. By May 8 this company boarded a train for 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the soldiers proudly carrying a flag the women of 
                        Spencer
                     had made for them. Arriving in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , they learned that the quota for threemonth volunteers had already been filled and
                    enthusiastically agreed to become Company H of the 14th Regiment, Indiana Volunteers, one of the
                    state's six regiments organized for one year's service. Meanwhile, the president
                    called for 42,000 troops to enlist for three years, and the men of the 14th volunteered almost
                        unanimously.4
            
            Not far behind the soldiers of the 14th were men joining companies of the 19th, 21st, 31st, and 59th
                    regiments. A year later 
                        Owen County
                     men joined Company F of the 71st (they were mounted February 23, 1863, and became known
                    as the 6th Cavalry). In the late summer 
                  
                     4
                            Ibid., 626â€“27.
               
                     of 1862 three companies were recruited and attached to the 97th
                    Regiment. Harrison Woodsmall and W. L. Thompson, wounded at 
                        Antietam
                     with the 14th and discharged because of their injuries, helped recruit a six-month
                    company attached to the 115th. Late in the war 
                        Owen County
                     men were recruited for Company D, 149th Regiment. Many 
                        Owen County
                     men went to neighboring counties to enlist, so an accurate count of those who served
                    cannot be established, but according to David E. Beem's later estimate there were more than
                    1,355 Union soldiers from 
                        Owen County
                    . Most went eagerly. Over two hundred did not return.5
            
            The 14th Regiment joined George B. McClellan's army and held an outpost on the summit of
                        Cheat Mountain until the fall of 1861. The regiment then moved to
                    engagements in the Shenandoah Valley. The 14th suffered heavy losses at the
                    Battle of 
                        Antietam
                     the following year as part of the famed "Gibralter Brigade." They
                    fought at 
                        Fredericksburg
                    , participated in the 
                        Gettysburg
                     campaign, and fought at Spotsylvania. They moved into eastern 
                        Virginia
                     and served in the battle at Cold Harbor, where, just hours before his term of service
                    was to expire, George E. Mull of Company H was killed.6
            
            The 19th traveled to 
                        Washington
                     and became part of the unit later known as the "Iron Brigade." In the
                    summer of 1862 Company I suffered great losses at 
                        Gainesville
                    , at South Mountain, and in the Battle of 
                        Antietam
                    . The 19th was among the first units to engage the enemy at 
                        Gettysburg
                    . In the spring of 1864, the 19th participated in the bloody Battle of the Wilderness
                    and at Laurel Hill, North Anna, and Cold Harbor. A large number of the men
                    reenlisted that year as veterans.7
            
            The 21st (1st Heavy Artillery) was sent to 
                        Baltimore
                     in August, 1861, but the following February it steamed with Benjamin Butler's
                    expedition to 
                        Louisiana
                    . There the 21st engaged rebel forces at 
                        Baton Rouge
                     and fought upriver at the siege of Port Hudson and at Mobile. Many members reenlisted
                    at the end of their terms.
            The 31st Indiana first went to western 
                        Kentucky
                    . It fought in the campaign against Forts Henry and Donelson in 
                        Tennessee
                     and

                            was given by General William Henry French to the 1st Brigade of the division under his
                            command (3rd Division, 2nd Corps) after the men of the brigade had withstood particularly
                            fierce Confederate assaults during the Battle of 
                                Antietam

                            in the campaign that led to the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Battle of South
                                Mountain, September 14, 1862, was an early engagement in the

                     suffered heavy losses. The men of the 31st served at 
                        Shiloh
                     in April, 1862, before marching to Corinth, 
                        Mississippi
                    . In the winter of 1862 they fought in the Battle of Stones River
                    at 
                  Murfreesboro, Tennessee
               . The following year they moved forward to the Battle of
                    Chickamauga and 
                        Chattanooga
                    . As a veteran organization in 1864 the 31st participated in the 
                        Atlanta
                     campaign.
            The 59th Infantry joined General John Pope's Army of the 
                        Mississippi
                     and participated in the capture of New Madrid, 
                        Missouri
                    , in March, 1862. At the Battle of Corinth the men of the 59th were commended for
                    gallantry. They suffered heavy losses at 
                        Vicksburg
                    , where John A. Goodnight, John C. Jarvis, and Emsley W. Vaughn were killed. The 59th
                    remained at 
                        Vicksburg
                     until the middle of September, 1863, when they moved to 
                        Chattanooga
                     and participated in the victory at Missionary Ridge. They reenlisted as a veteran force
                    and after a furlough joined William Tecumseh Sherman's march to the sea.8
            
            In the summer of 1862, Company F, 71st Indiana (6th Cavalry) was sent to 
                        Kentucky
                    , where it participated in the Battle of 
                        Richmond
                    . In that battle it sustained the heaviest losses by any company from 
                        Owen County
                     in any one engagement. William D. Dunivan, Andrew G. Auten, Elijah J. Bivans, James
                    Deem, Thomas D. Fields, Noel Johnson, Eli Nations and Josiah Sheppard were killed, and many others
                    were captured. Those captured were exchanged and later redeployed in 
                        Kentucky
                    . At Muldraugh's Mill, John Hunt Morgan's forces captured the entire
                    regiment. Paroled, the men returned to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where they received mounts and became known as the 6th Indiana Cavalry. As cavalry
                    they went to eastern 
                        Tennessee
                    , where they helped to end the siege of 
                        Knoxville
                    . Eventually the 6th participated in the 
                        Atlanta
                     campaign. The men then returned to 
                        Nashville
                     and were sent on expeditions in eastern 
                        Tennessee
                     in pursuit of Nathan Bedford Forrest's army.9
            
            The 97th Indiana accompanied Ulysses S. Grant toward Vicksburg. The regiment joined
                    Sherman's army near the Big Black River. After the surrender of
                    Vicksburg on July 4,1863, the regiment went to 
                  Jackson, Mississippi
               , and then
                    moved to 
                  Memphis, Tennessee
               , and Tuscumbia, 
                        Alabama
                    . In November, 1863, the regiment made a forced march of four hundred miles in order to
                    take part in the Battle of 
                        Chattanooga
                    . More exhausting marches preceded the 
                        Atlanta
                     campaign. On Kenesaw Mountain, James L. Strong, William H.

            When they left their farms and went to war, the idealistic, highly motivated men did not know what to
                    expect. They were quickly introduced to the reality of war-endless marching, the boredom of camp
                    life, homesickness, the terror of battle. The letters they sent home referred to all of those
                    things. They offered a view of the war that could only be expressed in those lonely times common
                    soldiers spent "with pen in hand."
            
                    I "I'll Be Home for Harvest"
                
            Men who volunteered early in the war believed it would take no more than a few weeks to suppress the
                    rebellion. A majority of them came from farms, and they knew their work was vital to their families.
                    They were confident, however, that those left at home could manage for a couple of months. The 
                        Owen County
                     commissioners authorized assistance, based upon need, for the families of soldiers as
                    early as March, 1861, but few acknowledged that need in the beginning.11
            
            Enthusiasm for the Union cause gradually gave way to concern, then despair, as a few weeks of
                    excitement became months and then years. The soldiers' letters narrate a full range of
                    experiences-all new, for most were away from home for the first time. The men who could write
                    struggled to describe high adventure, rollicking camaraderie, exuberant self-confidence, chilling
                    fear, boredom, and desperate loneliness. They worried about the farms and families they left in the
                    hills of 
                        Owen County
                    , but they had a job to do and were eager to complete it.
            Among the men who volunteered for service at the first call was twenty-eight-year-old Andrew Jackson
                    of Company H, 14th Volunteers. He was a son of Henry and Nancy Dyar Jackson. He married Susan
                    Cooksey in 1857, and they had two little girls by the time he enlisted. In his first letter home, he
                    expressed affection for his wife and attempted to reassure her. From a camp in 
                        Terre Haute
                     in June, 1861, he wrote:12

                    much." He was hoping for a furlough and wrote, "nothing will do me more good than
                    to sit down to the table with you." At the end of that letter he told a dramatic story
                    illustrating the conflict the people of the mountains of western 
                        Virginia
                     experienced during the Civil War.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    I started out on the hills the other day to See if I could find
                                        something good to eat after looking for Some time I found a house and I had a
                                        great desire to go to it after arriving there I found a large family. I Supposed
                                        he was bettin against Union Soldiers but after Conversing with him a while he
                                        did not believe in trying to break up a Government that had protected him in his
                                        youthful days, and at this point we agreed upon he invited me to Stay with him
                                        to dinner the old lady Soon arrived and dinner was Soon ready this was the first
                                        time I was permitted to Sit down to a table we had everything that was good to
                                        eat and what Surprised me was the Ladies Sat down to eat with us it Seemed like
                                        home to me, as it was the first good meal I had eat in three long months

            The memories of that scene must have made the year ahead all the more painful for Andrew. His
                    eagerness for a fight weakened. Back home, Susan wrote encouraging letters to her soldier husband
                    and did her part to get others to enlist. She worried, however, that there would be no men left to
                    do the work on the farms. During the summer of 1862 Andrew seemed surprised by her activism.

                           you seem to bee in trouble about the men all enlisting so you do not

                                        rest of them as to that for they all have to suffer alike on the account of the
                                        men going to the war you say that you are [doing] all that you

                                        you have got to go and then I will know wht your influence is. you said you
                                        would like to bee with me and if I fell you would die bye my side for you think
                                        that fighting for our country is an ho[n]orable cause

            Susan wrote that she never sat down at the table without thinking of Andrew and wishing he were
                    there, and Andrew assured her that he, too, missed her. He sent her ten dollars and promised more,
                    but he had to pay the sutler. He wanted her to get someone to stay with her and not to go to her
                    father's home. He worried about her leaving the house and farm unattended.19 The letters of Andrew Jackson, more than any others, reflect the deprivation of families
                    left behind by Civil War soldiers.
            Another nine months of misery and the horrors of some of the bloodiest battles of the war led Andrew
                    to write the following letter.

                                        not well for I have been in another Battle and I received a slight wound in the
                                        left thigh but it is not dangerous at all but it will keep me in the hospital
                                        the rest of the summer and then I think the fighting will be over untill I am

                                    I will say this has been the hardest Battle that has ever been fought

                    Hicks may have inspired more men than did her married counterparts. She must have been a lovely
                    girl, as she was much on the minds of several men. John Hunter, for example, wrote her the following
                    letter.

                                            (private collection of Juliann McGinnis). The date on this letter is
                                            probably incorrect. In applying for an army pension, Andrew Jackson listed
                                            the first full day of fighting at Chancellorsville, May 2, 1863, as the date
                                            on which he received his wound. Since the letter describes the wound,
                                            Jackson probably wrote it in early May rather than early April. Andrew

                    Elizabeth Payne Anderson from the old Steele neighborhood near Wesley Chapel. They both enrolled in
                    Company B, 21st Indiana (later 1st Heavy Artillery), a unit organized by Gosport's James
                    Grimsley in 1861. They were sent east until the spring of 1862, when they boarded the steamship Constitution and sailed with Benjamin Butler's expedition to 
                        New Orleans
                    . A third son, Benjamin, wounded at Resaca, 
                        Georgia
                    , May 14, 1864, died in the hospital at 
                        Jeffersonville
                    .23 Over thirty years later "Vint" Anderson wrote
                    a series of columns titled "As a Private Saw It, Not as History Records It" for an 
                        Indianapolis
                     newspaper, the American Tribune. Describing the early days of his
                    service, he recalled several humiliating experiences.

                                        march in. They were heavy, broad heels and soles, and sewed. My brother and I
                                        had been wearing only such shoes and boots as our shoemaker had made for us.

                                    large, awkward shoes, just before starting on the march, we went down
                                        into the city and bought us each a pair of cloth shoes and threw away our heavy
                                        shoes, thinking cloth shoes would be much lighter to march in. The result was
                                        that the whole of the bottoms of our feet were blistered on the first
                                        day's march and when the blisters broke, the second day, the skin on
                                        the bottom of our feet all stuck to the woollen stockings we were wearing, and
                                        left us in that condition to march about 150 [?] miles. We
                                        were more than a month getting over this very foolish act.

               In another column, he wrote: 
                  
                     
                        
                                    As soon as I donned my soldier suit I made, like the rest, for the
                                        artist [who] was alive to his business, and who kept some guns and swords to
                                        place in the hands of the soldiers who wished to get their pictures. He was also
                                        an expert in showing us how to take the position of a soldier. When I went to
                                        get my picture taken and he saw I was a private he took a musket with the
                                        bayonet fixed and knelt down and showed me how to form a hollow square out of
                                        myself and resist a cavalry charge. I at once took to his idea and down on one
                                        knee I went, and with the gun and bayonet, as directed, my picture was taken. I
                                        got a dozen of them as soon as I could and took them down to camp, and about the
                                        first one I showed them to was Will Westfall, our closest neighbor boy and my
                                        mess mate all the time I was in the service. When he got hold of one of them he
                                        hollowed out to the boys to "all come here," and when a crowd
                                        had gathered around he showed them that picture of mine and said: "Oh!
                                        hell boys, let us all go home; it is not a bit worth while for any of the rest
                                        of us to go. Just look at Uncle Dudley's picture!"â€¦
                                        It makes a creepy feeling run up and down my back even now to write about the
                                        pictures that I destroyed and got others less fierce to pass around.

            James William McKee enlisted for three years in Company 1,19th Indiana Volunteers in the summer of

            A few weeks later James seemed more at ease. He was full of patriotic fervor but already was
                    beginning to feel the pull of problems at home. He needed to be both in the army and on the farm and
                    worried that he could not do enough for his family.

            The Oren referred to in the opening lines of James's letter was his brother-in-law, Oren
                    Tally, the husband of James's older sister Elizabeth. Oren had enlisted with
                    James's brother Robert McKee in the 31st Indiana. Oren died from measles leaving Elizabeth
                    widowed with the children.28
            
            In a subsequent letter James expressed concern about his parents and promised to help as much as he
                    could by sending money.

                        Owen County
                     soldiers commented in their writings that they could make more money in the army than
                    at home. Surely that was the case with James. When he reenlisted at the end of his term, the bounty
                    offered to reenlisting veterans may have been the motivation. James was promoted to corporal and
                    eventually to sergeant. He was captured at the Battle of the Wilderness and died in Andersonville
                    Prison,

                        engagements.30
            
            John W. Dean enlisted at the same time and in the same company as James McKee. Company I, 19th
                    Indiana Volunteers, went to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and then transferred, in August, 1861, to 
                        Washington
                    , where the 19th joined the Army of the Potomac. John's future brother-in-law,
                    James Lawrence Johnson (who would marry John's sister Rhoda Ellen), was a sergeant in the
                    same company.31 John wrote to his sister Emily, aged seventeen, soon after he
                    arrived in

                            reenlisting as a veteran would be entitled to one month's pay in advance and a
                            bounty of $402. William H. H. Terrell, Indiana in the War of

            "Captain" was the nickname John gave his sister Emily. John, Emily, and Rhoda were
                    three of the children of 
                        Fenton
                     and Elizabeth Mulvane Dean. The family had come to Jefferson Township, 
                        Owen County
                    , from 
                        Coshocton County

                        Ohio
                    , in 1845. Rhoda, the youngest, was born after their arrival.34
            
            Andrew Bush, born May 29,1833, was the son of German born David and Fredericka Bush, who had settled
                    on a farm in Jefferson Township. He married Mary Hilligas not long before he joined the army. Andrew
                    wrote often to Mary during his Civil War service, and many of his letters expressed worries
                    regarding the farm he had left behind. 
                  
                     
                        
                                    You stated in your last letter that you did not know what to do with
                                        the corn I dont know what to say about it but I think that Jacob ought to see to
                                        it and get Somebody to geather it for you and pay it in corn they are lots of
                                        men would be glad to work that way. Get someone if you can and fat some of the
                                        largest of them hogs for fatted pork will be worth somethin.

                     In his next letter two weeks later he wrote: "I want

                    concerns respecting corn gathering and how you get along with the things in general."36

                                            transcript (private collection of Gary L. Brown). In this letter, Andrew
                                            Bush describes one system used during the war to transmit Hoosier
                                            soldiers' pay back to Indiana. By 1863, another was in operation.
                                            The Indiana Allotment Commission provided each command in the field with a
                                            roll on which each soldier could specify the amount of money he wished to
                                            send home and the name of the person to whom it should be sent. The
                                            paymaster then issued a check on a 
                                                New York
                                             bank for the total amount sent by the men of each company. A
                                            state agent cashed the check and sent on the individual remittances.

            The Samuel Andrew mentioned was Mary's brother. Samuel and Mary were two of fourteen
                    children born to John and Mary Hilligas, who had come from 
                        Coshocton County
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , in the 1850s. Two other Hilligas children, James and John, married into the
                    neighboring 
                        Van
                     Horn family.39
            
            The two letters that follow were written by another 
                        Owen County
                     soldier to his family in 
                        Aurora
                    , Indiana. Elijah Barker was the second of thirteen children of a blacksmith, Hezekiah
                    Barker, and his wife Mary. Elijah left Indiana for the war in a shroud of sorrow. His wife and
                    youngest child had died not long before. Elijah entrusted his three oldest children to his
                    mother-in-law before enlisting. His youngest child, Amanda, was left in the care of his sister,
                    Elizabeth, and her husband, George Johnston. Elizabeth lifted little Amanda up to say good-bye to
                    her father as he prepared to ride off to 
                        Madison
                    , Indiana, to join Company D, 3rd Indiana Cavalry. Elijah handed his little girl a
                    half-cent coin, a token of that farewell that is still held by the family.40
            
            Before long, homesickness and boredom had settled over Elijah. He had joined for the duration, but he
                    did not expect the war to last more than a few weeks or months. From 
                        Maryland
                     in December, 1861, he wrote to Elizabeth and George Johnston:

                            1993â€“1997 (see footnote 35). After leaving the army at the end of the war, Andrew
                            and Mary had two sons, Uriah and Ira. They lived in 
                                Owen County
                             near Stockton before moving to 
                                Hamilton County
                            , 
                                Nebraska
                            , with several members of the Hilligas family. In 
                                Nebraska
                             three more children, Curtis, Nellie, and Edna, were born. In 1874 grasshoppers
                            destroyed the Bush and Hilligas families' crops. According to family tradition, the
                            settlers survived in their sod homes by hunting antelope for food and burning buffalo chips

            In the autumn of 1862 soldier David Johnson was discouraged about the lack of news from home. He was

                        Lafayette
                     Township to enlist in Company H of the 59th. He had counted on his sister, Eliza Ann,
                    to be his link with his home so far away. He wrote to her from northeastern 
                        Mississippi

                    about her and tried to advise her on matters of farm management. From

                    's young men held tight to family ties. They worried about their parents and
                    siblings back home. And when mail failed to arrive, they worried that their families had forgotten
                    them. How were the folks back in Indiana making do without their help? Could those at home
                    understand what their husbands and sons and brothers were experiencing? How could they forget to
                    write and tell their men the news from home? Would all the pretty girls wait for the
                    soldiers' return?

            Six months after John's death a friend wrote the following letter to Elsie Troth: 
                  
                     
                        
                           As a friend of your son John and an old mess mate, I thought that I
                                        would drop you a few lines. â€¦I was a mess mate of John's for
                                        over one year; for pertnear two year; loved him as a brother. He was a true and
                                        trusty friend to me. Myself and brother seen that him and Ike Norrice was buried
                                        as nice as matters would permit at the time. â€¦ [He] was a true and patriot soldier and one who gave his life for a gloreys cause
                                        and since the hour of death has arrived may the Christian hope be his support
                                        and some kind angel guide his spirit into the heavenly abodes of tranquility and
                                        peace is the sincere wish of a stranger and a friend. I will close for the

            Seven of the Harrold brothers of Patricksburg volunteered. Their mother was said to have declared,
                    "I wish I had seven more sons to give to my country." Alonzo and two of his
                    brothers served in Company H of the 14th. Jesse S. Harrold, a buggy maker from 
                        Spencer
                    , was one of the first in 
                        Owen County
                     to sign up. The day 
                        Lincoln
                    's call for volunteers came, he assisted David E. Beem in organizing a meeting
                    to rally the men of 
                        Owen County
                    -men who became Company H of the 14th Regiment.
            Jesse Harrold's story was one of the most remarkable to come out of the experiences of the 
                        Owen County
                     men. He was the only one of the Harrold brothers to be wounded, but he suffered a wound
                    for each of them. On March 23, 1862, he received his first wound. Six months later opposite
                    "Bloody Lane" at 
                        Antietam
                     he received four bullet wounds before he could fall to the ground. One bullet grazed
                    his right thigh; another hit his left elbow; and while he was leaning over holding his arm, another
                    shot hit the back of his head and split the flesh from base to crown. He was carried back to a base
                    hospital and placed in a fence corner, where he lay five days while nurses and surgeons attended to
                    the dead and wounded from both sides. After five days, Jesse was carried to a hospital, where his
                    wounds were dressed and where, immobilized and unable to turn, he lay sixty-four days.

            Lieutenant Harrold by that time, Jesse returned to his regiment and fought again at 
                        Fredericksburg
                     and Chancellorsville. It was during the third day of fighting at Chancellorsville that
                    he received his sixth wound. A ball from a Belgian rifle plowed through his bowels. He was carried
                    nineteen miles in a blanket and on a stretcher to a hospital, where he lay for two months of that
                    hot, flyinfested summer. It was reported in local papers that he had been killed in battle, but he
                    returned home to read about it.
            Jesse was discharged because of his injuries and lived until February 28, 1915. According to a
                    descendant, he claimed his six wounds did not bother him much-except for a stiff elbow.
            After the war, Jesse's brothers, Elbert Frank and Thomas Milton, continued to live in
                    Patricksburg. John R. Harrold was a grocer in 
                        Spencer
                    . Alonzo, William, and John A. Harrold lived and worked in

            In the summer of 1862, a middle-aged Indiana militia veteran, James Robinson, recruited a company in
                    his neighborhood in 
                        Lafayette
                     Township. Zachariah Dean recruited another in Jefferson Township. Both companies
                    mustered in on September 20 at 
                        Terre Haute
                     and were attached to the 97th Indiana. Robinson and his wife Jane Oliver, both born in 
                        Ireland
                    , had two daughters and two sons. The family farmed 368 acres a half mile from Vandalia.
                    Both sons served in the Civil War.53 In April, 1863, Captain Robinson wrote of a
                    dress parade at Fort Grissom, 
                        Tennessee
                    , and touched upon the plight of homesick soldiers.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    Our Col. had us out on last Sabbath on dress parade without arms. There
                                        were some nice little speeches made and we had our hearts cheered by the
                                        presence of four lovely ladies from the North, all married but one, and that
                                        one, one of the liveliest you would wish to behold. All admired her and I was
                                        glad that I was an old man for it was the means keeping me from trying to start
                                        a rivalry up with a particular favorite of mine in the Regiment, who has
                                        probably caught the wind in his sails and is now scudding along fairly before
                                        the breeze. I hope that they may sail on to the land in the haven of matrimonial

            Thirty-three-year-old Austin Arnett of Morgan Township wrote frequent poignant letters to Emerine
                    Hicks, whose letter from John Hunter appears above. The memories of their attending church, hoeing
                    crops, and visiting friends together sustained Austin in his loneliness. Some of the letters seem to
                    ask her to wait for him. Emerine did wait until after the war to get married, but she did not marry
                    Austin Arnett. In 1867 she married Samuel Stwalley, the husband of her deceased sister Mary
                    Caroline. Austin married Mary E. Watts in Gosport after the war and with her had four children.55
            
            Austin wrote the following letter from 
                        Arkansas
                     in April, 1863, just before his regiment marched to join the Vicksburg campaign.

                        Georgia
                     in 1864, Austin looked forward to leaving the army and asked Emerine to write to him.

                    writing to her. Another man, William Loser, wrote from 
                        New Orleans
                     in 1865.

            In a letter dated June 15, 1864, from 
                  Huntsville,
                            Alabama
               , an unknown correspondent sent
                    apologies to Emerine for his behavior on a recent furlough. It is unclear which of her suitors wrote
                    the letter, but his joy in being home for a visit seems to have overrun his manners. Back with his
                    company, sober and sorry, he apologized to Emerine in his best form.

            They may have been raised on hard work and meager comforts, but nothing in the upbringing of 
                        Owen County
                    's young men prepared them for the terror, exhaustion, and loneliness they
                    experienced in the war.
            By January, 1862, William F. Williams, Jr., was seeing more of the country than he ever dreamed he
                    would see. He and four of his brothers served in the Union Army. William joined Company I of the
                    19th Regiment, Daniel and Josiah were in the 97th, and John W. was in the 13th 
                        Michigan
                     Cavalry. The youngest brother James also enlisted. John was killed in the campaign
                    leading to the Second Battle of Bull Run in August, 1862. He and a cousin by the name of Jean joined
                    the cavalry together and died together.63
            
            While stationed at Fort Craig, near 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., William wrote to his neighbor, James Martin, and described his stay in the
                    capital as if he were a sightseeing tourist.

                  Gainesville,
                            Virginia
               . Comrades hastily interred his
                    body in a battlefield grave, and years later, when remains were removed to cemeteries, the body
                    could not be identified. He may be one of the 2,111 unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. A
                    massive granite sarcophagus erected by the 
                        United States
                     government in 1866 surmounts a vault containing the remains of these Civil War
                    unknowns, the first dead interred in the cemetery.69
            
            John Dean's family consisted of his parents, 
                        Fenton
                     and Elizabeth Mulvane Dean, his brother Solomon, and five sisters. Like many families
                    who settled in Jefferson Township in the 1840s and 1850s, they came to 
                        Owen County
                     as part of a migration from 
                        Coshocton County
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    . When fifty-one-year-old 
                        Fenton
                     Dean received word of young John's death, he signed up for a three year term
                    in the army. He wanted to finish the job his son had begun. A few weeks into his 
                  
                     67 Kelley probably referred to the Confederate withdrawal from
                            northern 
                                Virginia
                             in March, 1862. In response to this Confederate move, George B. McClellan
                            ordered an advance on Centreville, 
                                Leesburg
                            , and Manassas. Kelley and the rest of the 19th Indiana participated in that
                            advance. Nolan, The Iron Brigade, 44.

                        Memphis
                    . He eventually received a discharge. He lived another thirteen years plagued with the
                    disease and with the disappointment of not having avenged his son's death.70
            
            A day book penned by Private Daniel Williams described the journey of the 97th Regiment from
                    west-central Indiana to 
                  Memphis, Tennessee
               . The men of the regiment gathered at 
                        Terre Haute
                     where they boarded a train for 
                        Indianapolis

                        Louisville
                    , where they boarded the steamboat Mary Miller. Daniel described his
                    accommodations on the boat.

                                        how we are piled around here in the boat some laying at the heels of the mules
                                        trying to sleep but the long eared animals keep such an awful kicking (for they
                                        are crowed too) that no on can sleep very good.

            Travel by overloaded riverboat was hazardous. Repeatedly the men had to go ashore to lighten the load
                    when the boat ran aground on shallows and snags. Daniel described sights along the
                    Ohio and Mississippi rivers. At times he seemed overcome
                    by the natural beauty of the river. Twice he described "lovely females" waving
                    their handkerchiefs from shore while they passed.

                                        well fortified place Fort Pillow which the rebels had once possessions of on the
                                        Tenn. side, but was taken possession of by our Government after a desperate
                                        resistance by the enemy. There is a few federal soldiers now stationed. Below
                                        Fort Pillow in a very high bluff is the ruins of

                                            This document is partly a diary and partly a memoir. Williams appears to
                                            have produced the document after the Civil War by copying a diary kept
                                            during the time of his service and adding additional commentary and
                                            background information. In the passage quoted here, Williams recalls his
                                            company's journey to 
                                                Louisville
                                             in the early days of his service. Later, he appears to begin
                                            quoting directly the diary he kept in the field.

                                        delightful, warm and pleasant. â€¦ Several of our Co. boys was taken
                                        from the boat to the city hospital at

                                        . A Soldier belonging to Co. B 97 Regt. by the
                                        name of Meek accidently shot himself very badly in both hands while on guard. He
                                        was discharged. â€¦Nov. 17â€¦it is a bad day
                                        for it is raining and very disagreeable under foot, and our old tents leaks very
                                        bad they never was any account therefore our Col. would never receipt for them

                                        an esteemed young soldier James G. Starnes who died at the General Hospital in 
                                            Memphis
                                         of pneumonia and measles. We [he] was intered
                                        this evening. The health of the Regt. is but poorly. â€¦ [Nov.]

                                         is at this time a destroyed city. She has at this time (and to her

                                        up by degrees. Sometimes five and six houses will be fired of a night by then
                                        (and they generally burn to the ground). A great many is left in suffering
                                        conditions no doubt I am ashamed to say that our whole Reg. by detail are
                                        guarding the property of traitors and have been ever since we have been here in
                                        this rebel city. Two or three soldiers is stationed at nearly every house

                                        gone they are the worst traitors there is.

            Daniel continued his daily entries as the 97th left the 
                        Memphis
                     area and marched south into 
                        Mississippi
                    . More houses and one fine church were burned. He told of slaves leaving their masters
                    and joining the Union march. Finally, on November 28, the men of Daniel's unit prepared for
                    an attack. He described an interesting turn of events.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                           the artillery was stationed in an upen field â€¦ We had a good
                                        position for an attack, the men appeared all cool and deliberate. We all
                                        expected and attack this being the first time the 97 was ever
                                        formed into line for battle â€¦ no attack being made we stacked our
                                        arms and the boys began serching around for something (as they always do) and
                                        behold they came upon two full barles of molasses hid in a deep ravine in an old
                                        field and they soon bounced it and carried it to the top of the hill away went

                                        several miles in the advance. A good many of our boys gave out today. Several
                                        where taken prisiners belonging to some other Regts.

            Daniel's day book entries grew increasingly negative. In northern 
                        Mississippi
                     he described very poor country and depleted soil. A torrential rain flooded his tent.
                    And everywhere he looked he saw suffering. "The troops are also causing great distress with
                    the women and children for they are firing all the buildings left. Women and children
                        crying."76 Daniel's unit camped near the

                     at a little town named Wyatt. Daniel found Wyatt to be a
                    desolate place, "perfectly destroyed and robed of every thing, the country here is awful
                    rough and yellow knobs. A man of good sense would not live here."77 His
                    spirits lifted briefly on December 7, but weariness soon returned.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                           We received orders last night to have our guns all c[I]eaned up nice, hands washed and head combed and breeches legs outside our boots
                                        neatly brushed on the Seventh for Gen. Grant and Staff was announced to inspect
                                        the Corps under Sherman. Morning arrived and we was all fixed up the best we
                                        could. Shoulder straps shine quite brilliant on the occasion so we all ourRegt,
                                        alligned ourselves neatly at parade rest when Gen. Grant made his appearance on
                                        horseback with hat off and rode along our lines without saying a word. We
                                        expected to hear something from him, but we where dispointed â€¦ We
                                        would all love for this war to come to a close. The soldiers is getting tired of
                                        war and of the tented field.

            While marching through 
                        Louisiana
                    , brothers Vint and Will Anderson of the 1st Heavy Artillery were unable to keep up with
                    their company through the wet terrain and fell back. In his memoirs Vint recalled a poignant scene
                    from that day.
            
                    
                        As we went back through 
                                Franklin
                             we were drunk, or the most of us had joined our Captain and if not drunk were
                            overflowing. It was "surging whiskey" we had got hold of and as we went
                            back through 
                                Franklin
                            , we were most of us astride our long guns our captain as well as the rest as he
                            was too full to ride his horse and had to be held on the cannon to keep him from falling
                            off, we were all holding on to each other and swinging our bodies first to one side and then
                            the other. Singing as best we could.
                    
                    
                        As we were passing close by a dwelling in the above fix, reeling and singing I
                            caught the eye of one of those bright and beautiful women of the south that makes a
                            fellow's gizzard flop every time a man thinks of them even though they were ardent
                            rebels. I caught her eye and she looked so sad and beautiful; she made such an impression on
                            me that it seems but yesterday, although old hime has ticked off thirty-seven years. Just as
                            we got up in front of her I caught her eye again and she threw up her hands to her face and
                            dropped back. I think she would have fallen but for another woman-a mother, perhaps-caught
                            her and pushed the door to. I was sobered and my song was ended at once, and I have often
                            wondered what caused that sudden burst of

                        grief. Perhaps it was the thought that in that cruel war she had lost a brother or
                            perhaps a lover, but we shall never know and all is mere speculation.

            Andrew Bush, in his letters to his wife Mary, also wrote of life on the march. In October, 1862, he
                    described a hard journey through

            Sickness plagued Andrew's friends, and he tried to keep the folks at home informed. On
                    January 20, 1863, he wrote from 
                        Tennessee

                           this note leaves me in good health hopeing this may finde you the Same
                                        and all the friends in good health; the weather to-day is nice and warm and evry
                                        thing has the appearance of Spring; wee have had some prety bad wether here for
                                        the last few days which made it bad on the Soldiers; about two seeks
                                    [weeks] ago wee had a pretty good Snow the biggest one that has been in
                                        this county for many years; it was about three inches deep on the level, wee had
                                        to stand on picket guard when that Snow fell and we had to be in it three days
                                        but wee had to grin and bare it; if wee did not have togoe on picket guard wee
                                        would have an eazy time of it; wee have our tents fixt up in the best of stile
                                        and they are good and warm; wee draw planty of provition at this time; wee dont
                                        draw any hard bread but wee get plenty of flour; I have got to be baker in my
                                        mess and have got to baken good buiscuits, as good as any body can bake. I must
                                        tell you how I bake my bread, I take lard vinegar and Soda with a little warm
                                        water and Salt and thats the way that I make my bread it raises pretty well
                                        besides all that I prest me a bake oven and lid from an old cecesh one night,
                                        that holds buiscuits enough for fourteen of us at one time. I must tell you the

                                         and Boon is here in the city hospital. I was at the city hospital
                                        yesterday to see some of the boys. I saw Gabriel Hochsteter. He looks like a
                                        skeleton.

            A week later, seventy-five miles from 
                        Memphis
                    , he wrote that Mary's brothers James and Samuel were well but that
                    "N. Davidson â€¦has got the dispepsy verry bad and is so pore that he dont hardly
                    make a shadow." In this letter, Andrew expressed impatience with the progress of the march
                    toward 
                  Jackson, Mississippi
               .
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    Soldiers dont like to stay long in one place wee have not got to see
                                        any Secesh yet only those that come and give them selves up. They are comeing in
                                        verry fast they nearly all take the oath ofallegeance wee have not been in no
                                        battle yet but we were not far off when the Rebels were driven from their works
                                        on the Tallehatchie River wee could hear the canon roar.
                                        Our cavalry got prety badly whipt about a week ago about four miles from here.
                                        Ervin Wetherly was in the fite and got prety badly hurt by getting thrown from
                                        his horse. Wee get to see a good many boys that wee have known here to fore.

            Andrew and his brothers-in-law received packages from home from time to time. Some arrived
                    intact-some did not. Andrew expressed his pleasure with one: 
                  
                     
                        
                           Samuel got the Box that was Sent to us and I got five plugs of tobacco
                                        and a 1/2 gallon of dry apels and about the Same amount
                                        ofdryde peaches and Some butter. I also got the bucket and pans you sent. Wee
                                        got the peach butter Eliza Grimm Sent to Jacob and me.

                And he showed his disappointment with another:

                                    ] but I hope that we will soon get to move back to our old
                                        Camp at Fort Grissom or somewhere els any place els will do in refference to

            In the spring of 1863, Captain James Robinson wrote an encouraging letter to his son, Abraham, who
                    had just told his father of his decision to live a Christian life.
            
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Dear Son: Your favor of the 28th ult. came safe to
                                        hand yesterday. It gave me much pleasure to hear of your good health and that of
                                        Mr. Seward's family. You, however forgot to say anything about Miss
                                        Hensley's health. I hope she is well. I received a letter at the same
                                        time from Anthony and M. J.; they were well.
                        
                        
                                    I am well pleased to hear that you have made a start for that good
                                        land. I want you to prove faithful; be dilligent in your business, but more so
                                        in your devotion to God; be as honest as you can in all your dealings with your
                                        fellow man; and be more so, if possible, with that God has brought you safe thus
                                        far and still lead you safely to the Heaven of everlasting repose. Beware of bad
                                        company and shun the very appearance of evil, and now while you have made a
                                        start, be watchful unto prayer, for the Devil and his earthly imps will try to
                                        pervert your ways and they will laugh in concert if they succeed in laying a
                                        snare for your feet. Be careful what sort of company you keep, and may God guide
                                        and guard you to the end and at last give you a resting place high up in Heaven
                                        is my prayer.

                                        , Tenn. on sunday morning last at six o'clock, started
                                        through town and got on the railroad, (not on cars but on foot), and by
                                    11:30 A.M. we were at Moscow, 10 miles. We then went
                                        out on the State Road about one and a half miles and encamped for the night

                                    in a piece of woods. My tent stood between two graves with the stakes
                                        driven in both. We stayed there until 12 yesterday when we
                                        pulled up stakes and started for the railroad and got here in one hour, where we
                                        are now located, and probably permantly located, in a mudhole. There was a kind
                                        of Fort here. Our duty will be to guard the railroad. We are in the most
                                        deplorable looking place, Wolf River Bottoms, fit only for
                                        Indians and Secessionists. Rain came on last night about ten o'clock
                                        and it has been doing its best ever since. It is now 3 PM. The
                                        bottoms below us are all covered with water and it is rising fast. Our pickets
                                        came in about ten or eleven this forenoon and had to wade knee-deep. There is
                                        twice that depth now. We will have to call in the balance of the pickets, else
                                        they will be like Noah's dove and not find dry ground on which to rest
                                        the soles of their feet. We are within three miles of

                           Many letters come here from Indiana, and some newspapers filled with
                                        blood and thunder-nothing but wars and rumors of wars; and I have heard of some
                                        letters that advised men to desert and return home, and that they were preparing
                                        for bloody war and destruction. Those who are afraid to come out and fight for
                                        their country had better come and take a march with the army, and they will see
                                        the ruin and distruction of property that follows where an army marches
                                        thro' or encamps for any length of time; splendid mansions, churches
                                        and in fact everything of combustible or burning nature is licked up by the
                                        flames. We have seen level country where you could not see 1,000 rails in a day march. Horses, mules, cattle, hogs and sheep were driven
                                        off, or slaughtered and carried away; poultry of all kinds have disappeared from
                                        the farmers; the soldiers entering houses and carrying off what they could, let
                                        the articles be of value to them or not, and then breaking and tearing up the
                                        balance. I have seen us drive out to a plantation and load eighty wagons of corn
                                        at one time; we had taken forty loads before, and left forty or fifty behind,
                                        which has probably been hauled before now by others. These are but light things
                                        and you will have to see before you believe but some in Indiana may be like one
                                        of old, both see and feel. God forbid that ever the free and fair fields of
                                        Indiana should be drenched in blood from the veins of her sons and daughters;
                                        but may strife and contention cease and may wise and just counsels, and peace
                                        and harmony, prevail all over the land.

                           The boys are now enjoying good health generally, we have a few in the
                                        hospital yet, but all on the mend; and I think that our regiment will soon be in
                                        better trim for fighting than ever before; they are now pretty well versed in
                                        the duties of a soldier's life with the exception of fighting, and we
                                        have not done any of that (since the big battle that Peter Eick was in and
                                        fought with so much Christian courage when sinners turned and run). â€¦
                                        On last Saturday week (28th ult.) the rebels made a raid on
                                        this railroad by putting obstructions in the way; they took 54 prisoners, some of them soldiers and some citizens; they have been paroled
                                        there were four men from our regiment in the number. â€¦
                        
                           Lieut. J. S. Meek is now detailed as Quartermaster. I expect he will get
                                        the place permanently, and it will be one of the best appointments made. I hate
                                        to lose him from our company, but Jim is such a whole-souled fellow that I
                                        cannot say anything, and if his appointment is sure, Orderly Wm. H. H. Johnson
                                        will come in for Lieutenant. He will make a good officer, but I suppose I will
                                        have to whip him to make him keep his tongue still-it is always going but when
                                        he is asleep!â€¦ Mrs. J. S. Meek landed here safe on last Monday
                                        afternoon, well and hearty; and she still continues so. The Lieutenant is
                                    well!â€¦
                        
                                    Our surgeons are well and are as well liked as men in their capacity
                                        can be. Dr. Murphy is the life of the Regiment, and is a gentleman; his wife is
                                        here now. Dr. Hilburn is still the same jovial, jolly Doctor that he was in

                                        , and very attentative to his duty and waiting on the sick. Dr.
                                        McNaught is detailed at the hospital in

            Abraham W. Robinson, reinforced with his new-found faith, followed his father to war-and death. Both
                    are buried on the Robinson family farm. Abraham died of a disease. His father's death was
                    by freak accident. James Robinson was detailed to accompany the body of his friend, Captain
                    Zachariah Dean, home for burial. When they arrived, the casket was opened and personal effects
                    removed. In handling Dean's sword Robinson cut himself and died from the wound September
                    1,1863, the same day Corporal Isaac Norris and Sergeant John Troth were shipped back from 
                        Gettysburg
                     to be buried. Robinson's surviving son, Joseph W. Robinson, enrolled in
                    Company D, 149th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, late in the war.90
            
            Captain James S. Meek, of Company H, 97th Indiana, was detached from his command to serve as acting

            Young surgeon Jabez C. Hilburn, whom Robinson mentioned, was born in the early 1830s in Spartanburg, 
                        South Carolina
                    . He joined the 97th, and family tradition holds that he was captured and spent time at
                    Andersonville Prison. He survived and returned to 
                        Owen County
                     to practice medicine at Freedom until his death in 1873.92
            
            On April 24,1863, the 59th Regiment began its march to Vicksburg. On May 1 it arrived at
                            
                  Port Gibson, Mississippi
               , just as the battle there ended. At Champion's
                    Hill two men from Company A were killed, George W. and William W. Dyar. In the assaults on Vicksburg
                    the 59th sustained heavy losses.93
            
            Austin Arnett wrote a letter to his "Kind Friend" Emerine Hicks on June 6, 1863, in
                    a camp near Vicksburg. He listed the battles he had been in since the first of May: Port Gibson on
                    May 1, Thompson's Hill on May 4, Jackson on May 14, Champion's Hill on May 16, and
                    the second assault on Vicksburg on May 22. Remarking on the last engagement, he wrote:

            Edward Hines, of the 97th Regiment, was from Jefferson Township He was a neighbor of the Williams
                    brothers, whose writings appear above. When Edward wrote the following letter, on July 4, 1863, he
                    was weary and yearned for letters from home. As he wrote, word of the surrender of Vicksburg began
                    to arrive at his camp in 
                  Oak Ridge, Mississippi

                                        learn that General U. S. Grant has stopped the communications from going north
                                        until Vicksburg is taken but he has not issued any order preventing the mail

                                        close Soon There is a roomor her that Vicksburg has Surrendered all her forces
                                        and it is generally believed One thing certain we have not heard any Shooting
                                        last night nor this morning yet Lieutennant Elliot came along just now and says
                                        that the city of Vicksburg is taken for certain We have not yet heard any thing
                                        particular about it only that the rebels have Surrendered the place we will jump
                                        up and down for joy. The weather is very warm here at present but I think that

                                        North or South from here I am not able to Say but all the troops that is here at
                                        this time if we have heard the truth from Vicksburg wont be kneeded here now I
                                        would be glad if they would Send us to Virgina it would be so much more pleasant
                                        there than here especialy in the Somer Season this Southern country is very hot

                                        part of three nights wee did not get more than two hours sleep each night; wee
                                        were nearly worn out against wee got to Black River the
                                        distance being thirty miles; pore fellows could not bare to be golted and it was
                                        hard on them as well as us. the dust and heat with the Scarsity of water made
                                        the task more Severe than it would have bin if the wether would have been
                                        Cooler; but that one hard job of work is done and will Soon be forgoten like
                                        evry thing els in the army; Soldiers are not much concerned how things work all
                                        that is cared for is enough to eate and drink; all the time that the Soldier
                                        feels concerned is when he gets into battle and See his fellow Soldier fall by
                                        his side wallering in his blood then is when a feeling of revenge comes in one
                                        so strong that one feels like as tho they could go threw most any kind of a
                                        place, wee lost thirty one in killed and wonded and I cant See what is the
                                        reason that they wasnt more hurt than they was for they was eleven peices of
                                        canon right in front of us and two that cross fired on us they threw shells and
                                        grape shot at us from ten oclock in the morning until five in the evning; our
                                        company lay in an open field where the Sun had a fare Sweep at us we could not

            Andrew reported regularly on the health of Mary's brothers, Samuel and James Hilligas. From
                    Vicksburg, on September 28,1863, he wrote:

                                    I dont think that all the men in the

                                         could have taken this place from the rebels if they had of had
                                        provision but General Starvation done the fighting not General Grant.

            Not long after Andrew wrote that letter, he and the rest of the 97th Regiment left Vicksburg and
                    began to move toward eastern 
                        Tennessee
                    . In a letter from 
                  Iuka, Mississippi
               , Andrew described their march.

                                        will go I cant tell at the present time but I expect that wee will go on toward
                                        Rosen crantses [Rosecrans's] army; wee are under the
                                        comand of General Sherman and he is ordered to reinforce Rosen Crants So wee are
                                        on our way and have been marching in getting to this place from 
                                            Memphis
                                         ever since the eleventh; the way that wee come is about
                                        â€¦ one hundred and twenty miles from 
                                            Memphis
                                        ; the boys have Suffered a good deal on this march and about half of
                                        the regmentgave out and had to be cept in the cars from lagrange 
                                            Tennessee
                                         to this place; Samuel and James gave out John Moyer Blake coan
                                        Lorence Wetherwax and Joseph Lenhart are all that gave out that you are
                                        acquainted with. Samuel wasnt able to more than walk nicely when he first
                                        Started but he stuck up to the walk four days before he gave out; James
                                        blistered his foot So that he could not march and had to be put abord the cars;
                                        The Health of the regment is improveing fast Since wee left Black

                                        . We are getting into a more Healthy climate and I am in hopes that
                                        we will not get any farther South while this Cruel War lasts for us boys have
                                        been sun burnt enough for onct and drank mudy water enough to do us as long as

                             and then set off through

                     Andrew told Mary that he was sending "seven small
                    cedar bushes" with Peter Hochstetler who was going home on sick furlough. He directed her
                    to plant them on their baby's grave and on his father's grave. She did plant them,
                    and the trees they became still stand today in Bush Cemetery in 
                        Owen County

            When food was plentiful and conditions peaceful, even soldiers on the move could be content. In one
                    of his letters, Andrew Bush described a camp at which his company paused on its way to 
                        Chattanooga
                    .

                Later, Andrew described the food he and his comrades took while on the move.

                                        and good fresh pork and Some times wee had butter and buiscuits of the best;

                                    officers for they ought to kept better rules; our brigade travails with
                                        General Sherman and wee are his guards and I dont think that men in disguise
                                        will get into our Camp without Some troubble; Curious are the ways of war

            Foraging for provisions had its risks. Andrew told of one such mission that nearly ended in disaster.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                           I must tell you about the Gurilar chase that I had on the eighth day of
                                        this month [November, 1863]; wee lay one day at 
                                            Fayette
                                         on Elk river
                                        
                                            Tennessee
                                         and whilst staying there the General ordered a detail from our
                                        brigade of fifty men to go on a foraging expedition and as usual it came my turn
                                        So we were mounted on mewls and put under the Command of quartermaster Sager and
                                        off wee went at full speed. Nothing occurd of any importance until near Sunset
                                        wee were driving along our drove of mixt Stock of about four hundred head of
                                        hogs Sheep and cattle and a few ducks turkeys chickens and gees Strapt on our
                                        mewls just to make things look a little comfortable when all upon a Sudden and
                                        to our grate surprise the gurrils were down on us and were fighting our rear
                                        guard and picking up the Stragglers. But wee were not long in getting ready for
                                        them. Wee made a dash at them, but they would not Stand their ground So wee had
                                        a nice ride after them I guess that they never were horse jockeys that Strove
                                        harder to win a race than wee did to ketch them but our mewls were too much worn
                                        down to overtake fresh horses. Our mewls did all that they could do and So did
                                        wee but to know porpes. wee lost to men; how many the guerilas lost I cant tell.
                                        I do not see what was the reason they did not kill more than they did for the
                                        bullets flew thick and fast; but we got our Stock to Camp and that's
                                        what wee went for

            In mid-November, Andrew and the 97th reached 
                  Bridgeport, Alabama
               , and
                    prepared to meet the enemy at 
                        Chattanooga
                    .
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    More than one month has passed of hard marching and us boys are nearly
                                        worn off to the Knees. I am well with the exception of feeling somewhat Soar in
                                        my Shoulder and feet;â€¦ General Brag cant whip our army but he can
                                        were us out running after him and thats all the way he can kork us. I am getting
                                        somewhat Herd of marching over this Southern country. It tuck us thirty four
                                        days to get to this place and only rested five days out of the thirty four and
                                        they say it is four hundred miles and over some of as rough country as I ever
                                        saw in my life. We were two days crossing one chane of the Cumberland
                                            mountains;

                                    the distance across the mountain was about twelve miles but wee were
                                        buisey both days, wee had to help the wagons along which wasnt a nice job by
                                        know means for wee had to carry our guns and knapsack and work, all at the Same
                                        time and live on half rations for wee coudnt pres anything to eat on the
                                        mountain â€¦ the army that went threw before cleaned the country

            After the Battle of 
                        Chattanooga
                    , Andrew and the rest of the 97th Regiment made another hard march. They traveled over
                    one hundred miles into eastern 
                        Tennessee
                     as part of a force sent to relieve Union troops beseiged at 
                        Knoxville
                    . That mission accomplished, the 97th returned to northern 
                        Alabama
                     before setting out on the 
                        Atlanta
                     campaign in the spring of 1864.109 In late May, Andrew wrote to
                    Mary of his involvement in one of the early engagements of the campaign, the battle at
                            
                  Dallas, Georgia
               .
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    Dear wife I am on guard duty at General Harrows Headquarters where I
                                        expect to stay dureing the ballance of this Campaign and maybe while my time
                                        lasts in this war. But you must not think that I am out of danger. I thought
                                        when I was sent for to go on duty as the General's quarters that I
                                        would not be in any more danger from the enemy s balls. But the fight of
                                        yesterday was one of something awful the most severe that I have had to witness
                                        since I have been in the army. The rebel Cannoniers and sharp shooters got range
                                        on our head quarters and they did place their shott with grate accuracy. The
                                        shells burst in all directions Clost to us one Shell threw considerable
                                        quanttity of dirt on General Logan "Which made him look two way for
                                        Sunday. about eleven A.M. one of the stray bullets of Mister Reb Came along and
                                        found myself feeling for my chin and a mashed gun in my hand if it had not been
                                        for the gun, the bullet would have taken off my hole head. So it is lucky that
                                        things are know worse than it is. My chin is awful sore so much so that I can
                                        scarcely eate My hard tack but I think it will get well in a short time, the cut
                                        commences at the right corner of my mouth and runs from there to the lower part
                                        of the chin on the left side cutting all the flech for about two inches in
                                        length by one in bredth cleaning all as it went clear to the bone â€¦
                                        which will save me the trouble of shaving for some time.

                        of Gary L. Brown). John A. Logan was the commander of the 15th Corps, which included the 97th
                        Indiana. Andrew described him as "a savage looking man and about as dark as some of old
                        Abe's Contrabands he has some Indian blood in him the old Indian Chief we read about in
                        the Fourth Reader is his grand father, so it is rumored with us." Andrew Bush to Mary

            A week later Andrew wrote that his chin was still pretty sore but healing.111 As
                    the 
                        Atlanta
                     campaign proceeded, he and his brothers-in-law fared well but were tired and hungry for
                    fresh food. They had plenty of fresh beef from the droves of cattle accompanying the army and plenty
                    of sugar and coffee, but Andrew said, "I wish that we were somewhere where we could trade
                    our suplies for some vegetables. I am geting burnt up with old dry government rations. I have had
                    two messes of green appels Stewd and they done me right smart of good."112
            
            Finally, in early September, Andrew reported that 
                        Atlanta
                     had fallen and that he and his regiment had retired for the time being to a camp at
                    West Point, 
                        Georgia
                    , near the 
                        Alabama
                     state line.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                           I have not had the oppertunity to write for the last two weeks. We have
                                        been runing the enemy and have chaste them from 
                                            Atlanta
                                         at last our corps was part of the army that done up the flanking
                                        for old rebble Hood. General Sherman has proved him Self to be the champion of
                                        the day, he has outgenerald all of the rebel generals that has Come in front of
                                        him in this present campaign Three cheers for Cap Sherman and his western army.
                                        I am With the regiment at the present time. I left General Harrows head quarters
                                        about a month ago. Reason I left there is I was sick and not able to do duty and
                                        would not take the Doctors poison medicine therefore they had know use for me
                                        any where; I am truly glad I got with the regiment for as soon as I got with the
                                        regment I felt like as tho I had got out of jail. â€¦ this time I am as
                                        fat as a pet pig if Peter M. Hochstetler dont come back to the regiment I want
                                        you to get a dollar from him that I gave him when he went home on furlow. I gave
                                        it to him for to bring me some pepermint oil but if he comes to the regiment I
                                        want him to bring it with him and if you can I would like if you would send me
                                        the medicine that Dr. Canady spoke off. I want it so that when I get the
                                    [diarrhea] again I will have something to meete it with. Our campaign
                                        is over for the present. We are drawing cloths to-day a thing that we stand
                                        grately in kneed of. We are a shabby looking set of fellows. I think that we
                                        will be paid off in a few days. We have eight months pay due us and they thot we
                                        will draw six months pay, and if we do I want to send eight dollars home if they

            At the beginning of the war, patriotism motivated the men of 
                        Owen County
                    . They volunteered with their neighbors and brothers to defend their government,
                    "the best the sun ever shone upon."115
            
            Daniel Williams recalled the fervor of the 97th as the soldiers prepared to travel south in 1862.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    The heavy tread of the soldiers marching by that stiring music Yankee
                                        Doodle and the Stars and Stripes as they floated in the breeze made me feel
                                        proud that I was an American Citizen and that we all had offered our services in
                                        defense of the Constitutions and those stars and stripes which floated so
                                        proudly. â€¦ The Government our fathers had handed down to us. The best
                                        the sun ever shone upon. Should we suffer it now to go down. The flag that
                                        nations dreaded and dare not insult with such thoughts and the protections of
                                        our homes where our companions and children are. Who would not offer his
                                        services to help put down rebellion which had trailed our flag in the dust? None
                                        but a traitor himself.

            The soldiers did not question the necessity of rallying around their flag, and few doubted that the
                    rebellion would be settled quickly. General George B. McClellan's campaign against 
                        Richmond
                     in the spring of 1862 would end the conflict, and they would all go home again to their
                    farms and families. Recruiting stations were closed in April, so confident was the War Department
                    that no more men would be needed.117 But the war did not end, and morale sank.
            Then came the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in September, 1862. President Lincoln declared
                    that on January 1,1863, all slaves in states, or parts of states, that were in rebellion would be
                    free. For the soldiers of 
                        Owen County
                    , a new dimension had been 
                  As Andrew Bush stated, the 15th Corps and the rest of the of the Army of the 
                                Tennessee
                             particpated in the maneuver that turned Confederate commander John Bell
                            Hood's flank in the last week of August and rendered the Confederate position
                            untenable. Boatner, Civil War Dictionary, 33â€“34.

                     added to the war, a change of which many disapproved. They
                    believed they were now fighting a war not only to save the Union but to free slaves, and many of
                    them disliked the idea of risking their lives for the liberation of black people. Emancipation would
                    be debated among the 
                        Owen County
                     soldiers. It would be feared, and it would arouse great anger. No longer would the
                    soldiers of 
                        Owen County
                     be united in purpose. United in allegiance, yes. But the 
                        Lincoln
                     administration and "the negro question" fired bitter arguments among
                        them.118
            
            Back in Indiana, meanwhile, intense political conflict raged over the prosecution of the war.
                    Democratic newspapers and politicians charged that Republicans used the war as an excuse to exceed
                    the bounds of the Constitution and increase the power of the federal government. They also condemned
                    what they considered dictatorial actions by Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton. Republicans, for
                    their part, charged Democrats with sedition and disloyalty to the Union.
            Party animosity only deepened with the announcement of the emancipation policy. Democrats declared
                    that 
                        Lincoln
                     had turned the war into a fight to free the slaves, and they warned that emancipation
                    would bring a wave of black migration into Indiana. Opposition to emancipation helped the Democratic
                    party take control of the state legislature in a sweeping victory in the elections of 1862. In the
                    wake of that victory, rumors were heard of a conspiracy to take Indiana out of the Union and with 
                        Illinois
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     form a confederacy of the Old Northwest.
            Talk of conspiracies was mostly unfounded, but political violence did occur in Indiana during the
                    Civil War years. Political meetings were disrupted, Republican mobs attacked the offices of several
                    Democratic newspapers, and resistance to the draft sometimes ended in bloodshed. As the war went on,
                    disunion back in Indiana became a common topic in the letters of the 
                        Owen County
                     soldiers.119
            
            Captain James Robinson found himself in the middle of the politics of the war. In a letter to his son
                    in February, 1863, he reported that his unit was seeing very little military action. It seems their
                    idle time was spent arguing about the political news filtering into their camp.

                                    Now, Abraham, there is some talk here that there is a muss brewing in
                                        Indiana. I wish you to keep your hands clean of it and let the curse follow
                                        those that join in civil war in Indiana. I know that I have left some behind who
                                        were willing to imbrue their hands in their neighbors bloo[d] when there was a
                                        chance for plunder and robbery, but who were too cowardly to turn out and fight
                                        the battles of their country.

            Before the war, Vint Anderson was a student at Indiana University. There he engaged in some heated
                    debates with a friend named Simmons about slavery and the political issues dividing the North and
                    South. Anderson recalled, "I had told Simmons that if the worst came to the worst that I
                    expected to volunteer [for the Union] at the first drum tap and he said he would do the
                    same"-but for the Confederate cause.121 One day during the war, while stationed close to a
                    hospital used for Confederate prisoners, Vint struck up a conversation with one of the wounded, a
                    soldier from 
                        Mississippi
                    . Vint learned that the injured Confederate was a neighbor of his old friend Simmons.
                    Vint and the wounded soldier continued the debate he and Simmon had started before the war about the
                    moral and economic legitimacy of slavery. Thirty years later Vint reflected on that conversation.
                    Simmons called slavery "'God's Holy Writ.' There is a screw
                    loose some where. â€¦ This boy was thoroughly imbued with the belief that they would
                    succeed because slavery was ordained by God, and God would be with them." Vint went on to
                    write in the 
                        Indianapolis

                                    Our regiment was as patriotic as any of the rest in the Union but I
                                        believe if they had known that the war was for the almost express purpose of
                                        freeing the slave at any time for the first two years of the war, that three
                                        fourths of them would have deserted. I can still hear ringing in our ears such
                                        expressions from them as this; ["]cf-d the negro, I never enlisted to
                                        free them, etc."
                                    122
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            Vint and his brother Will became very much interested in the wounded boy from 
                        Mississippi
                     and came to visit him almost every day. They brought him food that the hospital did not
                    furnish. A friendship developed and a bond of trust. The Andersons believed they had convinced the
                    boy that the rebellion was a lost cause, until one day he said that he could not wait to get back to
                    his post of duty. At that

                                        government of her own with some other of the western States. I trust that it
                                        aint so for if it is so us pore soldiers will have to Suffer. Some of our boys
                                        are jubelant over the news; they think that if old Indiana would slip out of the

                                        that wee and our friends can do. I dont like old Abe's proclamation but
                                        I cant help myself at this time. If I had thot that it was the idea to set the
                                        negroes all free they would not have got me to act the part of a Soldiers in
                                        this war. But as it is I am willing to fight for the union if it will cause the
                                        freedom of the last beastly negro in the South for I dont think that they are
                                        human. I am in for anything that will cause Union and peace of our once hapy
                                        government If peace is ever established they will be one class of men that will
                                        know how to enjoy it and that will be the Soldiers. If the big men that made
                                        this war would have to do as the common Soldier does peace would be made in less
                                        than two days. I will just state here in this place what we have had to do altho
                                        wrong it may be [for me?] to right [some?] things tho it is the truth. We have had to march forty five miles in two days
                                        and carry all of our Couterment which weigh eighty pounds with us. When wee done
                                        that wee had no bread or Salt: all that we got to eate was hogs that we would
                                        get after we came to a halt at night and sometimes there would be Some that
                                        would not be lucky enough to get any: this is true as the rizeing and setting
                                        Sun; When wee were on that march I thought that if I was at home I could ask a
                                        blessing at the table in good faith; both horrors upon horrors are to be
                                        experienced and seen; no one at home can form any idea of how things are; I
                                        thought that before I left home that I had drawn a true picture but I was
                                        mistaken. a picture cant be drawn; know man can tell all; I have seen men die in
                                        the Hospital and know [one] to lay them straight and they would [leave?]
                                        them lay on the cot on which they died on for to and

                                    three days before they would be burried; I will not write any more of
                                        this at this time; if I will ever get home I will tell it all to you;

            Andrew did the letter writing for other men in his company, his brother-in-law Samuel Hilligas for
                    one. The day after he wrote to Mary, Andrew helped Samuel write to the Hilligas family. Parts of the
                    faded letter are illegible, but the message is clear.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    I have no good news to write at this time, all the news that we get is
                                        horror upon horror It is the news here in camp that the western States are about
                                        to form a separation; or draw from the federal goverment and I heard that it may
                                        be the democratic party that is doing it but I cant think that it is so; and I
                                        hope it may be a false rumor for I cant think that the people of the western
                                        States would go against there interest and against us â€¦ in a way that
                                        would cause the destruction of the greatest army that ever the sun Shone on; it
                                        has bin Sayd and rumered in camp that if Indiana would draw off from the federal
                                        goverment wee would get to come home but I think they will finde it to be a
                                        mistake about going home for I think that old Abe has got us in his possession
                                        and he can hold us and take us where he pleases let the western States do as
                                        they are want to; but I am in hope that things will take a diferent turn when
                                        the next congress comes in session; I trust that the negro question will be
                                        â€¦ forever to never to be reserected again; I am getting more against
                                        the negroes every day. They are a detestable rase of man kind â€¦ made
                                        to be despised. But by some they are worshipt I hope the day will come when all
                                        men can view the Negro in his true light and place â€¦ that is where
                                        they are and the condition that they are in; I think it will â€¦ them
                                        the best; all that I have seen yet were well clothes and well fed and lived in
                                        good houses. I have never seen one living in a house that was any wors than the
                                        one that you live in; it kneed never be suggested to me any more that the Negro
                                        is fed on Cotton Seed and polk greens for I seen that it aint the truth.

                    "the Negro question" were heating up.

                                        well and doing well; as for the present I have not much to right. They aint much
                                        Stir at this time among us only on the Negro question that brings forth words,
                                        Sometimes great quarrels. Wee have had

                                    a good deal of sickness with us but the health of my regiment is
                                        improving. wee did not have a man to get excused by the doctor; Jacob Nihart
                                        isin the city hospital and is very sick with the tifoid fever I think it will go
                                        prety hard with him to get well. George Boon and Gabriel Hochstetler are getting
                                        better. I want you and Mary to do the best with my property that you can. I rote
                                        a letter to Mary yesterday and gave a statement of facts relation to the
                                        property; things that Jacob and Mother dont feel disposed to give up you kneed

            In an undated letter, John Gardner argued to the folks at home that slaves hoping for escape from
                    their masters were pawns in the game of war.

            An articulate young man, Ara Fraizer, pondered the news reaching his camp in the spring of 1863.
                    Writing to his parents on May 16, he began by reporting that he was recovering from an unnamed
                    illness, but he quickly turned to the politics of the war.

                                    it is with pleasure that I can say that I am ingoying better health
                                        than when I last wrote to you I hope when these few lines comes to hand they may

                                        as I havent mutch to write I will say a few words on the negro subgect my views
                                        is this It is the pollicy of the administration at present to arm and equip all
                                        negroes who are willing and fit for the service, and put them into the

                                         is here now raising all the negro companies and regments he can,
                                        & I tell you, they dont come in slow, for he has raised five regments
                                        already, he has not been with us over two weeks, he has full power to grant
                                        commissions to white men as officers over them all those negroes who do not go
                                        in the army, are to be put upon the plantation of their masters who have gone
                                        into the rebel army, their to gain support for themselves and families, and see
                                        how it will seem to breathe free air awhile, & be masters instead of

                                    now no doubt, some of our copperhead frends almost swoon over such an
                                        abolition doctrine, and think it an unpardonable sin both personally &
                                        nationly, but I can endorse the whole plan, & with my hand upon my hart,
                                        say with strong emphasis-Amen! I can stand it very well to have the negroes take
                                        the place & property of their secesh masters & take their
                                        muskets & shoot them (if need be) for I certainly think more of a good
                                        union Negro than of any white traitor, be he whom he may I want to say a word or
                                        two, in as kind a maner as I can to some of those tender toed gentleman who are
                                        willing to stand still & for the sake of political strife, cry out at
                                        the top of their voices, stop the war! grant an armistice: never free the
                                        negroes-it is unconstitutional-it is not Democratic: it is a negro abolition
                                        war! now my opinion is that all this hue-&-cry is to try &
                                        discourage us, & to cause as many to desert as possible & as we
                                        are about to drive the rebels to their last hole, it is to give them time to
                                        fortify against us
                                
                        
                                    I want it distincly understood that I am for putting down this
                                        abominable rebellion, let it cost what it may: for I consider that I, with
                                        thousands of others, have left home, frends, & relations &
                                        everything that makes life Comfortable-& not only that, but periled our
                                        lives-for the sole purpose of putting down the rebellion, & to maintain
                                        this Government, the best that the world ever knew: & I know that it is
                                        not to gain political power or a great name or to get the Greenbacks: as has
                                        been said of us that I am here to-day: but it is to fight for the Union negro or
                                        no negro, I will tell you that we are not fighting in vain, for we are as sure
                                        to make the rebels get on their knees to ask our pardon, as that their are fish
                                        in the ocean or fowels in the air
                                
                        
                                    let me say in conclusion, that those who will stand back &
                                        dispute about political plans & measures & not give even their
                                        influence to the Union cause, but stand & quarel over such trifling
                                        things, when their country is in danger; who cry, I am for the Union; while

                                        can to stop this war, when nothing but war will ever restore the Government as
                                        it should be: I say such men are too insignificant too associate with

            Ara may have intended his passionate expressions of patriotism to reassure his parents that his cause
                    was worth the price he was paying-the price they were paying as well. A month before, he had
                    received a letter in which his father had hinted that Rachel, Ara's mother, had changed.

            Ara himself was depressed and ill. In a letter from this period he told his parents of his efforts to

            Ara, weakened by disease, made it home to his Jackson Township family farm. He married Clara Angeline
                    Hunsicker in November, 1866, and they had four children. Ara died at age thirty-two, the year his
                    last child was born.131
            
            Writing sarcastically, Enoch and Thomas Alexander expressed to their brother-in-law their hope for a
                    quick end to the war: "we know that the Negrows is all freed and we all so now that old Abe
                    is a abolishenist he is a armen the Blacks as fast as he can Adjutant General Thomas is her now
                    making up Negrow Regiments as fast as he can and says he has ful arthority to make up as many as he
                    thinks necsary I guess they will soon clean the Sesech out."132

                           I am getting awful Hard of the Campaign it has been three months since
                                        we left Scottsboro Since then we have been exposed to the heat and rain without
                                        any tents to lie under; I wish that this war would end with the Campaign So that
                                        I could come home in time for the election to put one vote in against old Abe;
                                        for I think if he is elected the war will last four more years Some people think
                                        that the South cant hold out much longer but that is a mistake for the South can
                                        fight us for twenty years if they want to Some may think that this is all
                                    talk [illegible] but I can See the point wherein they can hold out
                                        but I cant See the point where we will Starve them out or whip them out for we
                                        cant do neither one nor the other

            The men who enrolled in those first companies surely believed they would eventually confront enemy
                    fire, but they probably did not anticipate the most deadly enemies of all: contagious diseases,
                    dysentery, exposure, and fatigue. As early as October, 1861, a measles epidemic struck Camp Jim
                    Hughes, located just south of Gosport, where the 59th was encamped for the first winter of the war.
                    After the war, Lieutenant James W. Archer of the 59th wrote the following account as part of an
                    application for a disability pension.
            
                    
                  About sometime in last of Oct. or beginning Nov. 1861, 1 do not
                            remember precise date, the soldiers of the 59th Ind. Vols, in Camp at
                            Gosport Ind. contracted measles, We were in Camp in a Fair Ground, our selves and men
                            occupying the stock stalls, many of the men got very bad with measles from exposure. The
                            citizens of Gosport Ind. kindly offered the use of their houses for our sick men Many of
                            them were moved to said houses, from one or two to a half dozen perhaps to each house. I had
                            had measles in early boyhood, and as many of our Co. "A." boys were sick,
                            and moved to sd. houses, Capt. T. S. McNaught who was in command ofsd. Co. A. 59. Ind. vols, of which Co. I was 1st Lieut, ordered me to go and wait upon and look
                            after the care of sd sick soldiers. I did go and for several weeks continued upon said duty,
                            day and night, until sometime in Jany 1862. I finally broke down from the great fatigue,
                            exposure, labor and loss of sleep incident

                        to, and absolutely nescessary in taking proper care of our said sick soldiers. As
                            part of said duty, I was in every house, at least once every night, where we had any sick. I
                            waited on them, gave them medicine, lifted them, turned them in bed, helped them up to
                            stool, washed the poor fellows, who had diarrhea in connection with measles and had lost
                            control of the discharges from their bowels, passed from house to house, looking after
                            nurses that they were watchful and careful, seeing that fires were kept up, (it was cold
                            weather part of the time very cold) seeing that medicines were properly given &c.
                            getting very warm, in the warm rooms, and in going out into the cold in a perspiring
                            condition, getting chilled, and constantly contracting cold thereby-This condition of things
                            continued for several weeks, combined with great strain of lifting, turning, and changing
                            men in their beds, finally broke me down in my back, and I had to give up and go to bed
                            where I lay for some days with great pains in my back &c.

                     in 1840 and farmed for a few years. They then moved to 
                        Wisconsin
                     Territory, tried their luck in the 
                        California
                     gold fields, and several years later returned to 
                        Spencer
                     to engage in a variety of businesses.
            James volunteered for the Union army in September, 1861, and helped to raise Company A of the 59th
                    Regiment. The men of Company A called themselves "Alexander's Rifles" but
                    changed the name to "Noble's Rifles" when General Lazarus Noble sent them
                    three hundred Enfield rifles. Archer was elected first lieutenant and the following April was
                    detailed aide-de-camp to General N. B. Buford. Archer resigned in January, 1863, on a
                    Surgeon's Certificate of Disability.135
            
            Archer received the Congressional Medal of Honor for bravery at the battle of Corinth, 
                        Mississippi
                    . The citation recounted that Archer "Voluntarily took command of another
                    regiment, with the consent of one or more of his seniors, who were present, rallied the command, and
                    led it in the assault." According to the report filed by General Buford: 
                        [On the morning of October 4, 1862] the battle raged with great fury. In front
                                of us we saw regiment after regiment give way. Our whole front moved forward with the
                                accuracy, precision, and steadiness of a review. Every man exhibited the resolve that
                                not one foot of ground should be lost. The Forty-eighth Indiana was the first actively
                                engaged, when the gallant Lieutenant Colonel Rugg was first partially disabled by a
                                severe wound in the foot, and soon after totally by his horse being killed. My

            Letters from John W. Clark tell of his duty in a hospital in 
                        Washington
                    , D. C. John was a member of Company I, 19th Indiana. At first, his work in the hospital
                    was light, and he had time to see the capital. On June 4 and 5, 1862, he wrote: 
                  
                     
                        
                           Dear Aunt It is with pleasure I take my seat to inform you That I am
                                        well and hope these few lines will find you the same. It has been raining very
                                        hard here to day and has kept me from going out. A week ago I was out and
                                        "Old Abe" made a speech to the 12th and
                                        16th Ind. Vol. and it pleased them very much, the capital is the
                                        prettiest place I ever saw, you cannot see twenty yards in it for the pine,
                                        cedar and flowers. I have had quiet a nice time since I have been here.
                        
                        
                           There are about 75 wounded in this hospital but none
                                        in my ward. We are looking for some wounded to come here to day. They hoisted a
                                        flag on the courthouse yesterday for the first time since I have been here.
                        
                        
                                    June 5th 62
                                
                        
                                    The wounded have come and the surgeons are busy dressing the wounds.
                                        They are not seriously wounded. Some were put in our ward.

            A few weeks later John still seemed confident and happy, but his letter reported a serious turn of
                    events.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    It is with pleasure I take this opportunity of addressing you a few
                                        lines to let you know that I am well at present hoping that these few lines find
                                        you the same.
                                
                        
                                    The hospital is nearly full of men but they are not many very sick.
                                        There was seven hundred come to the city on the steamboat. Out of this number
                                        there was one hundred brought to this hospital.
                                
                        
                           I am satisfied here very well. I herd that my regiment, the 19th Ind. Vol. was cut up very badly but I dont believe it. I see by

            John returned to the 19th in time to fight in the Battle of

                     in September, 1862. The 19th went into the battle with two hundred men. By the time it

                                    I hope to inform you of the painful fact that my poor child has fallen
                                        in battle. There has been two letters received here that have the painful news.
                                        Chancy Patrick wrote a letter here that he had just buried John. He said he was
                                        shot in the back of his head. He said he

                                        standing by his side when he fell. I suppose he did not suffer an instant. He
                                        wrote in his last letter that he was back with his regiment for he was tired of
                                        hospital life.

                                            Lexington
                                        , Mo. informed us of the murder of her poor son John. A band of
                                        rebbels took him and eight others prisoners and formed them in a line and made
                                        one poor fellow kneel and shot him. Then poor John Willims begged the rebbel
                                        captain for his life for he was a prisoner of war and he just siezed him and
                                        drew him up to him and fired off his piece killing him. Poor Mary thinks its
                                        enough to make the angels weep, to see such [barbarous] things
                                        and while they were gone to his burying there home was robbed and they
                                        emmediately moved to

            Moses had just buried his brother-in-law, Alvin Beaman. He wrote the brief letter to tell Samuel and
                    Lucinda Rogers Beaman they had lost their twenty-three-year-old son. A month later, Moses, too, was
                    dead, leaving an eighteen-year-old widow, the Beamans' daughter Charity.142
            
            In October, 1863, John C. Criss of Company A, 59th Indiana, wrote to his friend John A. Johnson from
                    the hospital at Jefferson Barracks near 
                        St. Louis

                        Vicksburg
                     three weeks earlier.

                                        especially in a hot climate, and there the doctors can do but very little
                                        towards controlling it. Great knots will form on the bowels; they will discharge
                                        ulcerated matter and go to eating into the bowels until they ea[i] great holes
                                        into them, when the patient is bound to die. â€¦ When I first took it I
                                        was strong and vigorous and when I left the hospital after a three or four weeks

                Anderson saw sickness and butchery of the worst sort, and he described them thirty-seven

                           When the seige at Port Hudson began every day or two our hospitals,
                                        would have recruits from there, of the boys that would get wounded. None from
                                        our company came, but one day they brought in a young Irishman that had been
                                        struck in the eye and the ball had passed under the brain and gone out at the
                                        back of his head. Though fearfully wounded he was full ofLfe and would swear
                                        that he was not going to die and as he was placed close to me, we talked
                                        together frequently. The morning I left for home he was sitting up on the side
                                        of his cot and the nurses were dressing his wound by pushing lint through his
                                        head. It was an ounce ball that he had been struck with. I said to

                                        well now that you are going to God's country, I will be going there by

                                        head." Some men would die with very slight wounds whilst it looked like
                                        others were not born to be killed and this boy was one of the latter.
                                    â€¦
                        
                                    One day a man was brought in my ward from the siege at Port Hudson,
                                        having been wounded there with very sad news for me, by the careless thumbing of
                                        one of our gunners he had allowed the fire to stay in the gun. A wet swab is
                                        used to swab them out after each disharge. The gunner is provided with a leather
                                        thumb-stall. This is to be pressed down over the touch hole hard so as to
                                        prevent any air passing out at the touch hole, â€¦ but if air is
                                        allowed to pass out at this touch hole, it only fans the fire and when the
                                        powder is rammed down it makes a premature explosion. â€¦ The
                                        consequence was it exploded while the powder was being rammed down and one of
                                        our boys was killed and another had both eyes put out. â€¦ These
                                        comrades were both good, dear friends of mine, and when I heard of their death
                                        and injury I could not refrain from crying.

                                    One sweet girl in particular called forth my strongest sympathies for
                                        her. I say sympathies for I do not believe a just and a good God requires the
                                        sacrifice these nuns make for others. There was a young Catholic that was on a
                                        cot next to mine who died there; this sweet girl stayed by him the most of the
                                        time for several days before he died, and her kind face seemed to be a feast for
                                        him. â€¦ we believe that the man that can look into the eyes of these
                                        sad, sweet girls without falling in love with them ought to die, he has lived
                                        too long already.

                                        successful they were repulsed with a large loss to our regment. I Saw pass in
                                        the ambulances from our regment; I cant tell how many are kild or wonded but I
                                        supose the kild will equal the wounded. I will give the names of three that you
                                        are acquainted with that are kild George Smith, William Moore and orderly
                                        Johnson The wounded from our Company so fare as I have heard is James T. Dickey
                                        and Lorrance Wetherwax. they must have been more for those that were very

                                        maybe I will learn more about the particulars. Nothing more has been learned

                                        grave. Pore David is at rest he will not hear the roar of cannon or see the dire

                     in 1862.151 Late in the war, he wrote
                    letters to his wife Nancy from the post hospital at 
                  Columbus, Kentucky
               .
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    It is with great pleasure that I seat myself this pleasant morning in
                                        Sept To let you know that I am enjoying good health. Also trusting through the
                                        kindness of Him who provides for all our wants, That these few lines may reach
                                        you in due Time and find you and those little Children surrounded with many of
                                        the comforts of life.
                                
                        
                                    We are still blessed with a great many patients some of whom are very
                                        sick. There has been one death since I last wrote you, in the Hospital. Though
                                        the man was nearly dead when he came in He died within less than two hours after
                                        coming into the Hospital.
                                
                        
                           Sept 22nd 64.
                        
                                    Now I will try and close my letter this morning Being that I have a few
                                        spare moments. There was another young man died yesterday after I had written
                                        the first part of my letter. He was the son of a very rich man in 
                                            Chicago
                                         His mother came down about a week ago She set up every night with
                                        him save one To-day She starts with his dead body for home. The young man told
                                        me that their yearly sales of goods footed up six and ahalf millions and often
                                        two hundred thousand dollars a week. So we see that the rich as well as the poor
                                        must die and at last be brought upon a level.
                                
                        
                           We have nice fall weather now though some appearance of rain to-day. The
                                        hundred day boys are getting very tired and restless, their time of enlistment
                                        having expired and they wish to return home. I understand that the 14th 
                                            Iowa
                                         & 52nd Indiana Regts are coming to relieve the hundred day
                                        troops We are looking for them to-day or tomorrow. We would all be glad to see
                                        them come, for we are very tired of nursing children. Mrs. Carlisle is able to
                                        be around again, she is going to start home on furlough or leave of absence next
                                        Monday if no providencial hinderance.
                        
                        
                                    Now as my partner is sick and I have to wait on twenty odd, sick men
                                        alone, I have but little time to write and not much more to sleep.
                                
                        
                                    Not having found my pocket as yet, nor saw the paymaster I am not
                                        prepared to send you any money.
                                
                        
                                    But as soon as I draw again I will send you a few dollars Though I dont
                                        know whether we will draw before Nov or not. Give my best wishes to all
                                        inquiring friends
                                
                        
                                    And if I get time I will write more this week.

                  152 Nathan Collins Hicks to Nancy Jane Hicks, September 21â€“22,
                        1864 (private collection of Mrs. Edward May).
            
            
            Nathan also wrote to his mother but restricted his comments to weather conditions and encouraging
                    signs of peace. His letters to his sister Emerine, meanwhile, require some reading between the
                    lines. As other letters in this collection demonstrate, Emerine received attention from an
                    assortment of suitors. Nathan frequently referred to the competition for her affection.
            
               
                  
                     
                        
                                    Dear Sister â€¦I dont know what I could write that would
                                        interest you Though there seems to be one thing on my mind which I will make
                                        known to you and that is this. You wrote me that you would, should or could, do
                                        so and so this fall, now I dont see it in that light but yet it may be so for
                                        there are a great may things that I cannot see, feel, hear, smell or taste these
                                        days, such as dried pumpkins, squashes turnips &c. Now I hope to hear
                                        from you soon and please tell me his name and what you think of him.

                Many of Nathan's letters also included joking messages to his youngest brother
                    Billy.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    Good morning Billy, how are you sir, and how is that gal of yours and
                                        when were you to see her last. Is she good looking and can she come in When you
                                        get these few lines Billy I want you to set down and tell me all the
                                        particulars, and please excuse me for not writing more but I expect that I have
                                        already written more than you can read

                    VI "I Have Indured Hardships a Nuff"
                
            Near the end of the war Austin Arnett wrote to Emerine Hicks from 
                        North Carolina
                    . Addressed to "Kind Friend," the letter repeated themes common in his
                    correspondence-weariness, homesickness, discouragement. Austin's regiment, the 59th, had
                    participated in Sherman's "march to the sea" from 
                        Atlanta
                     to Savannah and had stayed with Sherman's army as it drove north into the
                    Carolinas.

                  156 Austin Arnett to Emerine Hicks, January 8, 1865 (private collection of
                        Mrs. Edward May).
            
            
            Austin was discharged at 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., on May 31, 1865. He farmed near Gosport but complained of chronic sore eyes the
                    rest of his life, a condition he attributed to a war-related disease. He died August 31, 1890,
                    survived by his wife Mary and four children.157
            
            By February, 1865, John Ruble had begun to hear rumors of peace, but fighting in the Carolinas
                    continued. He wrote to his wife Elizabeth:

            Finally, in April, there was reliable talk of coming home.

            Nathan Hicks also wrote of leaving the army that April. He told his family that he expected to be
                    mustered out soon and that he looked forward to coming home. He was "getting tired laying
                    here," although the boredom had been broken by news of President Lincoln's
                    assassination.

                                        make, for in my opinon, if, have no more as smart men, we have, and therefore if
                                        his place cant be filled from their ranks, let them try another good old

                                            April 20, 1865 (private collection of Mrs. Edward May). The term
                                            "butternut" generally referred to either Confederate
                                            soldiers or Confederate sympathizers in the North. Nathan Collins Hicks
                                            appears to have been a "War Democrat," no admirer of the

                                             administration but a supporter of the war effort.

            In 1884, Captain David E. Beem of the 14th Regiment chronicled the participation of 
                        Owen County
                     men in the Civil War. He described the experiences of soldiers in eleven different
                    companies. He wrote words of highest praise and gratitude for their service.162
                    Along with several other 
                        Owen County
                     officers, Beem at this time also began a fund-raising campaign to erect a monument to
                    the soldiers in Riverside Cemetery in 
                        Spencer
                    . Every man who served was to have his name inscribed on the monument. In 1939, noted 
                        Spencer
                     sculptor, E. M. Viquesney, designed a pavilion for that purpose. The Women's
                    Relief Corps of 
                  Spencer, Gettysburg
                Chapter, then erected a memorial imbedded with bronze
                    stars bearing the names of all 
                        Owen County
                     soldiers.
            Remembering the soldiers' return to 
                        Owen County
                    , Beem wrote: "these volunteers went forth at their country's call,
                    ready to die, if need be, in her defense. Such was the purpose that filled and thrilled the hearts
                    of the Union volunteers. It is no wonder, then, that when they returned they did so as fathers,
                    husbands, brothers, lovers, and sons, loving their country, their families and their God in the
                    highest possible sense."163 In spite of complaints ranging from chronic
                    diarrhea and rheumatism to debilitating blindness and the loss of limbs, most of the survivors
                    returned to their neighborhoods, churches, and families and resumed productive lives.164 Evidence of dysfunction is hard to find, but a few of the men may have returned so
                    altered emotionally that their family connections were beyond repair. The war may have contributed
                    to the sharp rise in the number of divorces granted in 
                        Owen County

            The New Deal offered many opportunities for unemployed artists, but the only art program with a major
                    presence in Indiana was run by the Treasury Department's "Section of Painting and
                    Sculpture." From 1934 to 1943, the "Section" handed out commissions for
                    murals in new federal post offices, using an innovative "one percent for the arts"
                    scheme that carved the cost of the mural out of the total construction appropriation. In Indiana,
                    thirty-seven mural commissions were undertaken. Astonishingly, thirty-six murals remain.
            John C. Carlisle, a professor of English at Purdue University Calumet, has studied these post-office
                    murals for twenty-five years. In A Simple and Vital Design his reckoning is
                    thorough and affectionate. The main body of the book is a catalog of the extant murals arranged
                    alphabetically by town for easy reference as a "field guide." Each site entry
                    gives a quick registry of important facts and a few pages of illuminating commentary based on
                    archival research. At the head of this catalog, 
                        Carlisle
                    's introduction explains the history and method of the Section. He shows a fine
                    understanding of the lofty intentions of the program and the comical, delicate, and frustrating
                    negotiations played out between artists, communities, and bureaucracy in the name of
                    "public art."
            Unlike the government's first and largest job-creation schemes for artists, which were Works
                    Progress Administration programs run with an emphasis on the relief of the workers rather than their
                    artistic skill, the Section awarded contracts to artists on the basis of merit. This system sought
                    local talent by soliciting entries only from artists born or residing in the region of the new post
                    office. The program also offered the community a work of art in a highly visible, public space and
                    so cultivated both emerging artists and the "national taste." To ensure that the
                    artists and the public met on common ground, the winning artist was asked to fine tune his or her
                    design with either the Section administrators or a local arbiter (often the postmaster). This
                    procedure promoted sensitivity to the local history, economy, and geography, but it also encouraged
                    conventional concepts and a stock "regionalist" realism; a modernist such as 
                        Milton
                     Avery found it hard to paint something suitable for 
                        Rockville
                    . Nonetheless, high standards generally prevailed. All of these murals were competent,
                    and some of them were very good.
            
            The appeal of the murals is enhanced by the clever design of this book, which features Darryl
                    Jones's color photographs. Traveling around the state with an old-fashioned panoramic view
                    camera, Jones teetered on ladders, struggled with architectural obstacles, and prayed for sunny
                    days. He photographed most of the murals in daylight to capture them as they appear to visitors
                    today. The resulting color plates are truthfully dingy, and they make a valuable addition to the
                    book's documentary mission. Both Carlisle and Jones remarked that their work drew the
                    attention of post office visitors who would admit that they had never noticed the murals before.
                    This book should awaken others to see them as well, visit them in person, and appreciate the social,
                    cultural, and economic benefits that flow from government support of the arts.

                         Orphanage and the Tangle of Child Welfare. By Kenneth Cmiel. (

            A commissioned history of an orphanage seems to promise a dull read, but Kenneth Cmiel has used the
                    voluminous records of the 
                        Chicago
                     Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum to illuminate the history of child welfare in 
                        Chicago
                     over a hundred-year period in a wellwritten study that has much wider implications for
                    social welfare history than the story of a single institution.
            The orphanage was founded around 1860 and by 1880 housed one hundred children, all aged less than ten
                    years. Children were generally admitted because of family crisis; they were often brought in by a
                    mother and stayed an average of two years. Thus, in its first five decades the orphanage served
                    "dependent" not delinquent children. It was an institution for the working poor
                    founded and closely managed by upper-class matrons, the wives of 
                        Chicago
                    's business, legal, and medical elites. Chartered by the state in 1865, the
                    orphanage was privately run and funded until the 1960s. It began excluding black children after
                    World War I but readmitted them in the 1960s.
            The traditional, custodial orphanage was put on the defensive by Progressive-era child welfare
                    innovations such as the juvenile court and the "cottage homes" idea; nevertheless,
                    the orphanage survived with little change until the 1920s and 1930s, decades Cmiel calls
                    "the end of the nineteenth century." The home was still nominally managed by elite
                    women, but these suburban matrons now lacked the confidence of the nineteenth-century managers
                    (often their  own mothers and grandmothers) and sought the
                    advice of professionals on admissions and policy. In 1949, Chapin Hall, as it was now called,
                    entered a city-wide federation of private social service agencies.
            From this point on, Cmiel tells a story of decline and fall. The sense of loss and irony is
                    particularly evident in his account of what he calls "the unravelling"-the period
                    after 1963 during which Chapin Hall was first the beneficiary of state and then federal funding,
                    then suddenly in 1984 was closed down in the name of "deinstitutionalization" by
                    reformers who condemned as Victorian an institution that was in fact a fully funded, modern
                    treatment center serving as a therapeutic center for troubled youth.
            Cmiel provides a useful corrective to social welfare history narratives of "a progressive
                    elite ousting a Victorian elite" at the turn of the century (p. 207). His assertion that
                    "conservative institutions" like Chapin Hall far outnumbered
                    "cutting-edge institutions" like Hull House (p. 204) confirms other recent
                    scholarship on Progressive-era social welfare. Private associations to oversee and coordinate public
                    and private charities, notably the Charity Organization Society (COS), also predated the
                    better-known 1920s initiatives. Rationalized, bureaucratic social welfare emerged in the gilded age
                    and was led by reformers experienced in the Civil War era's 
                        United States
                     Sanitary Commission. In 
                        Chicago
                    , the Associated Charities, not the settlements, provide the prehistory for
                    twentieth-century social-work federation and bureaucratization, including the important
                    medical-social model of casework. The settlements, which turned social welfare inside out, putting
                    the reformers inside and leaving the clients on the outside, were, in contrast, a kind of
                    anti-institution.
            Cmiel's sympathetic account of the pre-1945 orphanage reflects in part the strengths and
                    weaknesses of his sources. These sources document the intentions of managers and professionals but
                    rarely the experiences of children, even when he supplements them after 1957 with psychiatric
                    social-work case records.
            The author sidesteps some opportunities to criticize the orphanage. For example, what are we to make
                    of Chapin Hall's 1870s "industrial training system" that produced a
                    division of labor where the girls darned "the socks of the asylum" (p. 24) while
                    the boys were allowed to find part-time work, presumably paid? This and other clues to the
                    orphanage's internal organization and conservative ideology go largely unexplored in a
                    study that focuses mainly on its external relations with private social welfare providers and public
                    regulatory agencies. Ellis Hawley's theory of an associative state provides a useful
                    framework for Cmiel's case study: the drama comes from the rise of private associations,
                    from the story of how "institutions without any ongoing accountability to the public [wound
                    up] â€¦regulating agencies like Chapin Hall" (p. 83). Cmiel's
                    well-written  study makes a contribution to the scholarship on
                    the history of the private sector and voluntarism. Since it is also a story that resonates with
                    1990s Republican plans to turn over social services to state and local elites and to replace
                    entitlements with private charities, it is even more to Cmiel's credit that he makes a
                    reader raised on Charles Dickens's Hard Times feel a little sad at the demise of Chapin
                    Hall.

            In this "exhaustive analysis of the 
                        Michigan
                     unemployed movement in all its phases and expressions" (p. xiii), James J.
                    Lorence provides scholars of the depression era, labor, and the left with a well-researched,
                    institutionally focused history of organizations of the unemployed in 
                        Michigan
                     with special attention to the state's industrial centers. Through extensive
                    research in archival collections, the papers of private organizations, newspapers, government
                    documents, and secondary sources, Lorence documents developments in the unemployed movement in 
                        Michigan
                     and links them to changes in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), the
                    Workers' Alliance of America, and the national economy.
            The Unemployed Councils, which joined with the Workers' Alliance in 1936 and took the
                    Workers' Alliance's name, dominated 
                        Michigan
                    's unemployed movement through the time of the formation of the CIO. From 1930
                    to 1933, Communist-initiated councils effectively led demonstrations, marches, and protests, the
                    councils finding most success in 
                        Wayne County
                    . Throughout the 1930s, councils and the Workers' Alliance succeeded in leading
                    and participating in struggles for unemployed workers in the Upper Peninsula of 
                        Michigan
                     where, for example, in 
                        Gogebic County
                     the Workers' Alliance remained the voice for organized workers as late as
                    1938. In the late 1930s, the Workers' Alliance joined forces with other organizations of
                    the unemployed and with the CIO's growing industrial union movement. Even in the areas most
                    taken with the United Auto Workers' (UAW) programs for the unemployed, the
                    Workers' Alliance consistently helped organize non-unionized workers.
            By 1937, however, most workers in 
                        Michigan
                    's auto-heavy industrial regions turned to the UAW, which had become a major
                    organizer of 
                        Michigan
                    's unemployed. Lorence argues that by joining  employed and unemployed unionists in one organization, the UAW, part of
                    the CIO, created a socially conscious union. This union, through its Works Progress Administration
                    (WPA) welfare department, began in 1937 to advocate for unemployed union workers and by 1938
                    "moved to extend its hegemony over all WPA workers" (p. 290). From 1937 to 1941
                    the union, which included many Unemployed Councils veterans, successfully mobilized its department
                    of unemployed unionists to support union struggles, as in the successful Ford union effort of 1941.
                    In doing so, it curbed the threat that unemployed workers held over strikers.
            Within this story of the UAW's ascendancy lies the rise of leaders such as Walter Ruether,
                    the decline of Communist party influence in unemployed organizing, and the increasing
                    bureaucratization and marginalization of the unemployment movement once it was completely embedded
                    in the automobile union. Lorence skillfully maps out the debates and factional squabbles among the
                    variety of Socialists, Communists, progressives, and labor bureaucrats who molded the direction of
                    unemployed organizing in 
                        Michigan
                    .
            Lorence's conclusions concerning the social vision of the UAW and the 1930s origins of
                    bureaucratized industrial unionism, however, seem particular to the histories of the UAW and 
                        Michigan

                    social vision that allowed it to successfully resist the statist vision prevalent in the UAW,
                    demonstrated that the UAW's path was not the only choice for unionists. Moreover, UPWA
                    unionists, Communist and non-Communist, remembered their Unemployed Councils experience as a lesson
                    in direct action tactics, which they later employed during shop-floor confrontations. These
                    observations aside, Lorence's study is an important contribution to the historiography of
                    unemployed organizing after 1935.

               Can Somebody Shout Amen! Inside the Tents and Tabernacles of American
                    Revivalists. By Patsy Sims. (
                        Lexington
                    : University Press of 
                        Kentucky
                    , 1996. Pp. xx, 234. Bibliography. Paperbound, $17.95.)
            
               With Can Somebody Shout Amen! Patsy Sims, best known for her work The
                        Klan (1978), adds to the list of recent works on southern Pentecostal revivalism. In a
                    six-year period, Sims attended fifty revivals and taped over 225 hours of services and interviews
                    with participants. Sims has made a prodigious effort to evoke the atmosphere of the revivals. This
                    kind of work is notoriously difficult if  only because the
                    preachers are autonomous and differ sharply in their beliefs.
            The book is well designed with chapters on revivalists like H. Wayne Simmons, Tommy Walker, R. W.
                    Schambach, Ernest Angley, H. Richard Hall, Mike Shreve, and the snake handlers. The author recounts
                    a number of moving tales, such as the one about the preacher who tried to raise his son from the
                    dead. Sims observes that the revivalists' religion has not been created in a vacuum and
                    describes their theology as filling a void in the lives of the "emotionally barren poor and
                    dispossessed and [easing] the insecurities of a generation growing up in 'cultural
                    anonymity'" (p. xvii). Sims also correctly notes that the preachers of the
                    revivals have historical precedents. She claims that "These men of God sprang out of a
                    tradition that dates back almost two hundred years" (p. xiii) to the Great Revival. Perhaps
                    an argument could be made that the revivals reach back to seventeenth-century 
                        Scotland
                    . Much of the emotionalism that Sims finds today was present at these gatherings.
            Sadly, when Sims reaches Chapter Four she joins the ranks of authors (such as Dennis Covington) who
                    reinforce Appalachian stereotypes. She launches a humiliating attack on the snake handlers. She
                    shows little respect for her informants by conforming to popular images of mountain people. In the
                    case of Flora Bettis (whose name she misspells as "Beetis") her description shows
                    much haughtiness and conceit: "At fifty-six, three years older than her husband, Flora
                    Beetis was the epitome of a sturdy mountain woman, tall, lean, with hook nose, weathered skin, and
                    hair drawn into a bun that resembled a ripe boll of cotton" (p. 101). Having spent years
                    with Flora Bettis and her husband, Brother Perry, I have a much different picture of them than Sims.
                    Concerning Sims's condescending and hackneyed standards for mountain women, I am appalled!
                    My mother, aunts, and women cousins are from the hills of southern Appalachia and certainly do not
                    fit Sims's description.
            In presenting her chapter on the snake handlers, Sims uses some poor sources, and this causes her to
                    repeat errors made by earlier studies. She claims at least thirty-five people died from snakebite
                    between 1936 and 1973. Steven M. Kane and I have found fifty-three deaths during that period. Sims
                    also states that snake handling "was abandoned for more than twenty years in its East 
                        Tennessee
                     birthplace after the first of the faithful was bitten" (p. 113). This opinion
                    was launched by J. B. Collins in his 1947 work 
                  
                            Tennessee
                         Snake Handlers, in which he claimed that Garland Defriese's bite from
                    a rattlesnake in 1918 caused snake handling to cease for a period. In fact, many of the believers
                    had been bitten before 1918. Finley Goodwin and Tom McLain are only two examples. I have records of
                    others who were bitten before and after 1918. Sims duplicates many other mistakes.
            
            Sims does not footnote Collins or indicate how she reached her conclusion that snake handling went
                    into a dormant period in East 
                        Tennessee
                    . Many works that have appeared lately by these so-called "creative
                    writers" and journalists fall short of scholarly standards and are carelessly presented. I
                    understand that these writers want to reach a wide audience and their publications are not
                    necessarily written for academics. Regardless, certain rules apply that Sims neglects. Her work does
                    not contain notes, and her research sources are presented as a bibliography. After a close
                    examination, the bibliography should have been offered as a selected bibliography. For example, in
                    describing Carl Porter and Clyde Ricker's brush with the law in 1975, Sims simply uses the
                    phrase "According to news accounts." What news accounts? She does not footnote or
                    place them in her "bibliography." If these recent books by journalists are
                    presented by their publishers as academic or historical, then they should follow the scholarly
                    rules. Sims conducted her research almost two decades ago and was originally published by St.
                    Martin's. However, the work is presented here as if it were current. Like other churches,
                    Pentecostal/Holiness religion is dynamic and does not stay fixed in time. If books like Can Somebody
                    Shout Amen! are to be reproduced by scholarly presses, much revision and editing are needed.

            Reminiscences, always necessarily present among the sources consulted by Lincoln scholars, are
                    finally attaining the respectability they deserve. Important evidence of this is the publication of
                    Don E. and 
                        Virginia
                     Fehrenbacher's Recollected Words of Abraham Lincoln. Calling
                    their book "a step toward the evaluation of a great body of source material and toward a
                    critique of its use by historians" (p. lii), the Fehrenbachers have assembled some 1,900
                    quotations as remembered by over five hundred informants. The result is a critical compilation of
                    the recollected utterances attributed to 
                        Lincoln
                     in contemporary or reminiscent sources. The Fehrenbachers' purpose is to
                    provide a comprehensive guide to things 
                        Lincoln
                     is remembered to have said, from extreme youth until his death, to serve as a companion
                    to the Collected Works (1953â€“1955), containing 
                        Lincoln
                    's speeches, letters, and memoranda.
            
            Mostly the Fehrenbachers have consulted published sources in their quest for 
                        Lincoln
                     quotations; in their bibliography of over four hundred items there is evidence of their
                    consulting just thirty-six manuscript collections. They consider the "high-grade
                    ore" of recollected 
                        Lincoln
                     quotations to be found in diaries, letters, and memoranda, sources in which 
                        Lincoln
                    's words were set down shortly after their utterance, mostly during 
                        Lincoln
                    's presidency. The editors have developed a guide to the evaluation of such
                    remembered utterances. Those cast in direct discourse and recorded contemporaneously receive a
                    letter grade of A, indirect quotations or paraphrases recorded contemporaneously receive a B, and
                    noncontemporaneous quotations (the majority of those compiled) rate a C. Quotations the authenticity
                    of which the compilers consider to be in some or extreme doubt are given a D or E, respectively,
                    though they are obviously not omitted altogether. Questionable quotations the Fehrenbachers consider
                    "germane to the evaluative process" (p. liii) and too important to the 
                        Lincoln
                     legend to be discarded.
            The unsurprising result is that the Fehrenbachers give high marks to 
                        Lincoln
                    's words as remembered by the likes of Orville Browning, John Hay, and Gideon
                    Welles in their diaries. The Lincoln quotations that they cite from the reminiscences collected by
                    William Herndon rate mostly C's because of their noncontemporaneity. They are more
                    skeptical of Herndon's own recollections of 
                        Lincoln
                    's remarks; they acknowledge Herndon's honesty but consider his memory
                    unduly influenced by intermediate events and his credibility compromised by a tendency to elevate
                    inferences and speculations "to the status of fact" (p. 238). Coming off less well
                    are works attributed to Ward Hill Lamon and Alexander K. McClure. Of the latter they write,
                    "Some of [his] recollections are so dubious as to cast a certain amount of doubt on
                    everything he wrote about 
                        Lincoln
                    " (p. 314).
            The compilers find a number of cherished 
                        Lincoln
                     lines to be questionable. One example, which originated with McClure, is 
                        Lincoln
                    's assessment of Grant after 
                        Shiloh
                    : "I can't spare this man, he fights" (p. 315). They are also
                    skeptical of 
                        Norman
                     Judd's recollection that 
                        Lincoln
                     defended his second question of Douglas at the 
                        Freeport
                     debate by saying, "I am after bigger game. The battle of 1860 is worth a
                    hundred of this" (p. 271). And they doubt Elizabeth Keckley's memory that 
                        Lincoln
                     feared that his wife might be sent to "that large white building on the hill
                    yonder" (p. 273) after their son Willie's death because the insane asylum in
                    question was not visible from the White House.
            This work will hereafter be indispensable, but it will surely be followed up by one or more
                    supplemental volumes. The Fehrenbachers would be the first to admit that they have not found all of 
                        Lincoln
                    's remembered quotes. More exist in the soon-to-be-published reminiscent
                    materials collected by William Herndon and in manuscript 
                    collections around the country, and a lot of "low-grade ore" also remains in the 
                        Lincoln
                     ephemera at the 
                        Huntington
                     Library and the

               Explicit and Authentic Acts: Amending the U. S. Constitution,
                    1776â€“1995. By David E. Kyvig. (Lawrence: University Press of 
                        Kansas
                    , 1996. Pp. xx, 604. Notes, bibliography, index. $55.00.)
            This book is the first comprehensive historical study of the formal process of constitutional
                    amendment under Article V of the 
                        United States
                     Constitution. That David E. Kyvig presents this first study more than two hundred years
                    after the adoption of the Constitution suggests that the formal amendment process has been seen
                    neither as the principal means of constitutional development in the 
                        United States
                     nor as a feature of the system worthy of analysis. Kyvig disputes this judgment as a
                    historian, and as a constitutionalist he argues that the only truly effective way to alter the
                    fundamental principles, forms, and procedures of American national government is through the formal
                    process of amendment.
            The book is a straightforward account of the use of the Article Vmechanism from its inception and
                    original application in the adoption of the Bill of Rights to the long-delayed ratification of the
                    Twenty-Seventh Amendment, which in 1992 denied Congress authority to adjust its own salary.
                    Explaining the political and constitutional history of the amendments adopted, as well as
                    controversial proposals such as the child labor and ERA amendments that failed, Kyvig provides an
                    indispensable reference work for students of American history.
            Kyvig's work holds interest as well for critics and theorists of constitutionalism. Although
                    he does not say so explicitly, he challenges the long-standing idea that the Constitution is what
                    the Supreme Court says it is. Rather, the Constitution is what its framers and ratifiers declared it
                    to be. Kyvig recognizes that from an early date judicial interpretation of the Constitution became a
                    convenient substitute for formal amendment as a way of resolving constitutional problems. This
                    practice did not have untoward consequences in the nineteenth century, Kyvig says, because the
                    constitutional problems that were beyond the scope of judicial review were also beyond the reach of
                    the amendment process requiring supermajority consensus. These problems-the status of slavery and
                    the nature of the Union-  were "soluble only through
                    the constitutional revolution achieved by the Civil War" (p. 473).
            The problem with Article V was that at times the process seemed too difficult to apply successfully
                    and at times too easy. In the Progressive Era, for example, four amendments were adopted in a short
                    period of time, showing the Article V process to be an effective instrument of constitutional
                    reform. Only a short while later, however, this experience was disregarded by the architects of the
                    New Deal. Instead of passing an amendment that would establish beyond doubt and for all time the
                    nature and scope of federal responsibility for the nation's collective social welfare,
                    which Kyvig thinks could have been done, the Roosevelt administration decided its purposes would be
                    served by getting the Supreme Court to change its interpretation of constitutional law. Although for
                    a long time this seemed a satisfactory way to conduct a constitutional revolution, eventually it
                    meant that New Deal measures based on the public philosophy of statist liberalism were subject to
                    repudiation and repeal.
            Kyvig questions-but only a little-Franklin D. Roosevelt's assertion that constitutional
                    amendment was too difficult in the circumstances of the 1930s. He says FDR was afraid of the
                    constitutional arguments that Liberty League constitutionalists would mount against any amendment
                    intended to give the federal government clear authority to regulate the economy for the public
                    interest. Maybe this means Roosevelt lacked confidence in the arguments his lawyers could advance in
                    support of the New Deal revolution. The main weakness in Kyvig's interpretation of
                    Roosevelt's constitutional strategy is his failure to appreciate the extent to which the
                    New Dealers were persuaded by the teaching of the legal realists that formal constitutional texts,
                    principles, and structures were essentially meaningless. He admits that FDR saw the Constitution as
                    fundamentally irrelevant, "a stumbling block to be circumvented" (p. 306). This is
                    an accurate accounting, but it is not clear that Kyvig appreciates that the evidence shows Roosevelt
                    to have been an anticonstitutionalist in comparison to the constitutionalism of the founding.
            Kyvig's critical treatment of New Deal "legal-realist" constitutionalism,
                    even if he does not understand his discussion in these terms, is the most original interpretation in
                    the book. The Constitution really was an obstacle to the New Deal programs, even if the liberals of
                    the day refused to take it seriously. With no little regret, historians like Kyvig finally recognize
                    this fact. This perception, along with many other insights in this valuable book, leads Kyvig to
                    seek to restore the framers' original understanding of the manner in which the Constitution
                    should be amended and constitutional government maintained.

               Wanted Dead or Alive consists of ten essays tracing the history of the media and
                    genres through which images of the West have been embedded in the popular imagination. This is not
                    to say that all the chapters deal with what is generally called "popular culture."
                    In the category of fiction, for example, there are separate considerations of the dime novel and the
                    serious novel about the West. The visual arts section includes paintings by eminent figures in
                    American art as well as the anonymous producers of the boots-and-saddles imagery of 
                        Madison
                     Avenue. A book on the West is not the ideal venue in which to determine where the
                    boundary between culture and popular culture ought to be drawn, and there is little effort made here
                    to sort out the reasons why that border ought to be especially permeable where cowboys, Indians, and
                    wide open spaces are concerned.
            The editor's reluctance to narrow the field is the reader's gain, however, because
                    the book contains all manner of fascinating Westiana, including commentary on fiction (high and
                    deliciously low), visual imagery of every kind, Wild West shows, rodeos, reenactments, good movies,
                    B movies (or "horse operas," usually in black and white), TV
                    "oaters," and western themes in popular music and country music. Nor are these,
                    for the most part, impressionistic treatments of their respective themes. Instead, authors provide
                    thoroughly documented mini-histories of their areas of expertise-from the first known Wild West
                    "blowout" (1882, in 
                  North Platte,
                            Nebraska
               ) to last summer's crop
                    of "mountain man rendezvous" held throughout the Middle and Far West. Most authors
                    conclude with a bibliography of authoritative sources.
            While useful to newcomers to the subject, scholars might wish for something a little more
                    adventurous-and less repetitious of the same chronological sequence of events punctuated by the same
                    cultural landmarks (thanks to the format, the publication of Owen Wister's The
                        Virginian in 1902 and the release of Edwin S. Porter's seminal film, The Great Train Robbery, in 1903 are discussed over and over again). A comparative
                    approach to the old chestnuts of western lore might have been more interesting. I longed to know if
                    or how the themes of John Ford westerns of the years after 1939 (Stagecoach, for
                    example) deviated from the content of non-western war pictures, comedies, and romances. I also
                    wanted to know how "important" novels dealt with the conflicts and natural
                    settings also employed by Louis L'Amour.
            It is clear that all the essayists have been influenced by the "New Western
                    History." They take their popular culture very seriously. Words like
                    "commodification" turn up frequently. But they are not  equally interested in American popular culture's exuberant
                    reaction to the popular culture of the West. One searches in vain for mention of Jane and Michael
                    Stern's bestselling analysis of the postwar cowboy ethos, Way Out West (1993). And it is a
                    pity, since the Sterns include so many of the bodily pleasures of westering: their chapters on chili
                    and buying cowgirl (or cowboy) outfits are definitive. Perhaps the joy and make-believe the Sterns
                    define as popular culture are not readily digested by the analytical machinery of the New Western
                    History.

               Living Our Stories, Telling Our Truths: Autobiography and the Making of the

            Lytton Stracheys observation that biographies tend to degenerate into what he called a
                    "funereal barbarism"-ponderous and much too voluminous-is equally applicable to
                    studies of autobiographies, with one important difference: those telling their life story get to
                    pick and choose what they want us to know. How, then, does an intellectual history, as this is, keep
                    its distance from such autobiographical traps? V. P. Franklin boldly ignores these concerns, and the
                    result is a study that ranges widely over one hundred years, tracing the origins and contours of the
                    African-American intellectual tradition.
            Based on the lives, if not the life stories, of twelve major figures from Alexander Crummell in the
                    nineteenth century to the powerful congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., in the twentieth, 
                        Franklin
                     argues for autobiography as "the most important literary genre in the
                    African-American intellectual tradition in the 
                        United States
                    " (p. 11). Bearing witness against American oppression, authors used
                    autobiographies largely for ideological and political purposes: to vindicate the race, as in the
                    case of Crummell; in an effort to save America from its worst self, as did James Weldon Johnson; or,
                    finally, as Harry Haywood did in the service of liberation. These works, 
                        Franklin
                     argues, explore "the nexus between personal experience and ideological
                    development" (p. 24). It is this, he insists, that sets the genre apart from any other kind
                    of exploration. Here matters of "truth" are (as it were) in the eyes of the
                    author, the result of a special set of experiences, and not some abstract statement of historical
                    accuracy. It is for this reason that 
                        Franklin
                     dismisses as largely irrelevant the criticisms of those biographers of Crummell who
                    insist that he painted a rather distorted picture of his missionary activities in 
                        Liberia
                    . For 
                        Franklin
                     such bending of history is largely immaterial when discussing  how Crummell saw the world; what Crummell claimed to be the truth was
                    the truth.
            Historians are taught to resist efforts of autobiographers to lead them where they will. They are
                    obligated to determine, for instance, if Ida B. Wells-Barnett's recollection of what
                    occurred during her visit to 
                        England
                     was accurate. Granted all memory is selective, but what one chooses to remember
                    matters. Nowhere, for instance, in his account of his years in consular service does James Weldon
                    Johnson broach the question, uncomfortable though it may be, of how one could act as a
                    representative of an imperial power that at home denied one's race basic human rights. And
                    if experience matters, as 
                        Franklin
                     rightly insists, Johnson's service to his country, in spite of all that was
                    going on at home, may help explain his abiding faith in the principles of equality for which the 
                        United States
                     stood. And again, if W. E. B. DuBois used personal experience "to illuminate
                    and clarify important matters of principle" (p. 230), I wonder why 
                        Franklin
                     does not discuss the "truth" of James Baldwin's
                    homosexuality.
            Pressed for space and fearful of rambling reviewers, editors are loathe to assign more than five
                    hundred words to a review. Generally, that is a blessing, but in this case this book raises so many
                    issues of significance to African-American history that the freedom to roam wider would have been
                    appreciated. 
                        Franklin
                     takes his readers on an exciting intellectual excursion during which we are prodded to
                    engage a wide range of issues. Although divided into largely discrete chapters, the whole is greater
                    than the sum of its parts, and that is to 
                        Franklin
                    's credit.

               Free to All: Carnegie Libraries & American Culture,
                    1890â€“1920. By Abigail A. Van Slyck. (

            Abigail Van Slyck takes as her subject those American cultural icons, the Carnegie libraries.
                    Millions of Americans hold cherished memories of time spent within their walls, and many, in all
                    likelihood, harbor the conviction that if you have seen one, you have seen them all. 
                        Van
                     Slyck quickly disabuses one of this assumption. Using material culture "as
                    important primary evidence" (p. xxii), 
                        Van
                     Slyck advocates replacing taste as the basis of architectural history with
                    "scholarly analytical skills that can be taught and that can be learned" (p.
                    xxiii).
            This study embraces the period from 1890 to 1920 when Carnegie grants, based on the fortune of steel
                    baron Andrew Carnegie, underwrote the construction of 1,679 buildings in 1,412 communities across
                         America. 
                        Van
                     Slyck ranges widely for illustrations, but her research concentrates on thirteen cities
                    and towns representative of the diverse environments in which Carnegie funds were used. One such
                    town, 
                        Union City
                    , Indiana, received its $10,000 grant before 1908, when Carnegie policies
                    began to require a design review.
            These early grants were made in the paternal spirit common to late nineteenth-century philanthropy.
                    But as Carnegie's "tainted money" came under attack from critics of big
                    business, he shifted from outright charity to an emphasis on shared responsibility. He required
                    communities to provide building sites and to tax themselves to pay operating expenses. In 1911
                    Carnegie fully embraced the corporate model of charitable giving by creating the Carnegie
                    Corporation to oversee his library enterprises.
            The key figure in this work was Carnegie's personal secretary, James Bertram, who became the
                    channel through which requests were received and evaluated, architects assigned, community
                    responsibilities mediated, and construction work evaluated. Bertram's experiences led him
                    to favor the position taken by newly assertive library professionals over those taken by architects
                    in matters of access, control, shelving, and the like. To this extent, therefore, Bertram and the
                    Carnegie grants played an important role in the development of the professional librarian.
            
               
                        Van
                     Slyck describes how Carnegie practices contributed to the shift from the monumental
                    architectural styles of the late nineteenth century to the more utilitarian styles characteristic of
                    most Carnegie libraries. She sees the ornate, monumental, treasure house aspects of earlier library
                    buildings as a metaphor for the social assumptions of the donors. Market forces and professional
                    librarians, on the other hand, would lead the twentieth century move toward utilitarianism, a move
                    that created buildings better suited to the needs of library staff and users. This discussion is
                    greatly enhanced by excellent illustrations of building exteriors, interiors, and floor plans.
            Much attention is given to library location in big cities where, says 
                        Van
                     Slyck, the male-dominated power elite opted for large central library buildings located
                    adjacent to the business district where they would reinforce the centrality of that district in the
                    city's business life. Branch library buildings were most often located in or adjacent to
                    middle-class residential districts close-by those who, it was assumed, would be their principal
                    users. In smaller towns, however, 
                        Van
                     Slyck finds that middle-class women, having assumed cultural leadership, campaigned for
                    libraries so located as to reinforce the distinction between commerce and culture.
            The late chapters focus on the special needs and concerns of women and children. It is difficult to
                    document this discussion because firsthand accounts of library use by these groups are relatively
                    rare.

                        Van
                     Slyck's analytical framework leaves little room for those who would claim that
                    developments  to which she attaches class or gender values rest
                    to a large degree on common sense. Would big city libraries be better had they been located in
                    marginal economic districts? Why should branch libraries not be concentrated in locations convenient
                    to their primary users? Was it inappropriate for library designers and professionals to expect
                    immigrants to conform to the expectations of the middle-class society that made libraries possible? 
                        Van
                     Slyck suggests answers, but a more complete discussion would probably result in a
                    second book.
            The evolution in our understanding of what a library is and should be continues today. Like schools,
                    libraries are now expected to provide a breadth of services not realized in Carnegie's era,
                    but their evolution into broadly based service organizations accessible to all owes much to the
                    pioneering efforts of the Carnegie initiatives.

               National Parks and the Woman's Voice: A History. By Polly Welts

            Readers today may not be surprised to learn that women have played a more substantial role in the
                    development and management of the National Park Service than many historians, agency managers, and
                    others have recognized. Likewise, few readers will find it surprising that women were more often
                    than not resisted or opposed (or at the very least not supported) in the drive to establish more
                    equal places for themselves within the Park Service. Still, some historians may welcome Polly Welts
                    Kaufman's well researched, written, and illustrated book documenting the achievements of
                    the many talented, conscientious, and determined women who have contributed to what the author
                    regards as the agency's success in meeting its mission of preserving and enhancing public
                    appreciation of the country's natural and cultural resources.
            The author documents the experiences of a diverse group of women, beginning with those who explored
                    the Yosemite Valley and other future park sites during the nineteenth century.
                    She then describes the roles women played in advocating the creation of various parks, and she shows
                    how early women professionals fared in what she describes as a male-oriented military culture.
                    Kaufman contends that the agency "lost its will to hire women professionals" after
                    1933 (p. 83) and that until the 1960s women most often contributed to the agency as wives of staff,
                    sometimes individually and sometimes in groups. Women then began to assert themselves as knowing
                    advocates outside the agency (including Indiana women  who
                    helped create Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore) and as capable professionals, managers, and workers
                    within it-all for the betterment of the National Park Service and the public it serves.
            Unfortunately, the author does a much better job of celebrating her subject than analyzing the many
                    complex issues that surround it. Kaufman's fundamental contention that Park Service culture
                    has been confused from the start by its two conflicting subcultures-"the military
                    ethos" (in other words, male culture) and "the public communications
                    approach" (female culture)-seems a bit thin and is never firmly established. She idealizes
                    women's culture with a seemingly endless stream of vague and platitudinous statements
                    ("The women who worked independently of the Park Service valued the continuation of life
                    most of all." p. xiv), while she dismisses male culture as rigid, undemocratic, and somehow
                    at odds with the agency's mission. One ultimately wonders what good the male culture will
                    contribute to Kaufman's proposed synthesis of the two cultures, something she suggests as a
                    worthy goal.
            The author certainly deserves recognition for her extensive research efforts, especially the hundreds
                    of interviews she conducted with Park Service women (and her incorporation of the work done by
                    Dorothy Huyck before her), but again, Kaufman's failure to analyze the material critically
                    often leads to the confusion of women's aspirations and achievements. Not surprisingly, no
                    woman in the book fails or performs poorly in her work, just as no woman participates in development
                    projects or inholders groups opposed to Park Service interests. Not surprisingly, too, there are few
                    if any interviews with men-certainly none that would provide a personal or real voice to the
                    unreasonable opposition to women's culture that Kaufman routinely assigns to the male power
                    structure. Obstructionist men tend to be stereotyped as insecure, threatened, and afraid (there is
                    even an index listing for "feminization, fear of on page 296), while the motivations of
                    supporters like Horace Albright are equally impersonal and unclear.
            Ultimately, Kaufman seems so determined to celebrate women's achievements that she misses
                    the opportunity to analyze political or class differences among the subjects (members of the
                    Daughters of the American Revolution who supported early right-wing preservation efforts are
                    essentially undifferentiated from late twentieth-century feminists, for example), and she ends up
                    demonstrating relatively little appreciation for the possibility that National Park Service culture
                    might be affected by anything more than gender relations. Certainly, gender is a critical issue to
                    consider when studying the Park Service or organizations like it, but we learn as little by
                    exaggerating its importance as we do by undervaluing it.

            This thirty-minute documentary is one man's story of one of the most tragic events in
                    Indiana's history. On August 7,1930, a mob of angry whites broke three black teenagers out
                    of the 
                        Grant County
                     jail. The mob believed that James Cameron and his two young friends, Abe Smith and Tom
                    Shipp, had murdered Claude Deeter and raped Mary Ball as the couple were parked in the
                    lovers' lane along the Mississinewa River south of 
                        Marion
                    . The vengeance-seekers brutally beat Shipp and Smith and lynched them from a tree on
                    the courthouse square. Dragged to the same lynching tree, James Cameron, aged sixteen, miraculously
                    survived, spared at the last minute, he says, because "a voice from heaven" rang
                    out and stopped the violence. Cameron served a prison sentence and has lived an exemplary life
                    since. He has spent much of his time in recent years telling the story of the 
                        Marion
                     lynching, first in book form (A Time of Terror, 1980, revised
                    edition, 1994) and now in this public television documentary.
            Cameron is a powerful storyteller, and the documentary filmmakers use his talents skillfully. An old
                    man now, he speaks on camera with precise detail and with regret, humility, emotion, and tears. The
                    camera follows him through the corridors of the now deserted 
                        Grant County
                     jail. He points to the cell that held him and to the rusted bars that only briefly kept
                    the mob out. At several points, the screen fills with the gruesome Lawrence Bietler photograph of
                    the bodies of Smith and Shipp hanging from the tree and the crowd milling about below, a photograph
                    that may be the most powerful and famous lynching photograph in American history. The viewer cannot
                    but be moved and angered by the story Cameron tells.
            
               A Lynching in 
                            Marion
                        
                describes the events of August 7, 1930, in a compelling manner. The historian
                    can quibble about some details presented, but the problems are far more serious than who fired the
                    gun that killed Deeter or how many citizens were in the mob. As moving as the story is, this film
                    fails miserably in explaining the contexts, causes, and meaning of the lynching. It is utterly
                    ignorant of the time and place in which this tragedy occurred, and it falls into the trap of dumping
                    blame on the Ku Klux Klan-and thereby avoiding the real issues of race in Indiana. Viewers gain the
                    impression that Indiana equaled the Klan in the 1920s and that the Indiana Klan equaled lynchings.
                    There is no acknowledgement that the organized Klan was dead by August 7, 1930. There is no
                    recognition that no evidence exists to connect the Klan to any lynching at any time in Indiana.
                    Rather than the broad and deep understanding of the Indiana Klan provided in Leonard
                    Moore's book, Citizen Klansmen
                     (1991), the viewer gets only simplistic sound bites of a
                    supposed Klan lynching.
            Nor does the film sort out the significance of place. Viewers are told of thousands of lynchings in
                    America. But they are not told that after a lynching in Indiana in 1903 the next one, in 
                        Marion
                     in 1930, was also the last one in the state. That there were indeed hundreds of
                    lynchings elsewhere in twentieth-century America is an important story but one that needs to be set
                    more precisely in time and place. Nowhere does the film suggest the important point that the 
                        Marion
                     lynching was so unusual because it was so late in time and so far north.
            Contexts of time and place are essential to begin to understand the larger tragedy of the 
                        Marion
                     lynching, more tragic than this film suggests. Rather than simple answers that blame
                    the Klan we need to understand the more complex matter of race and the color linethat fluid,
                    sometimes subtle, sometimes soft, sometimes angry line that white Hoosiers drew to deny black
                    Hoosiers full participation in so many aspects of life. We need to understand the simplicity and the
                    mystery of white fear and hatred. We need to understand, too, how some black Hoosiers and some white
                    Hoosiers in 
                        Grant County
                     and elsewhere fought against the racism represented in this lynching and against racism
                    in its more pervasive and subtler forms. The 
                        Marion
                     lynching can help us understand those central issues of race, but not as told in this
                    superficial, ahistorical documentary film.

                    , IN 46208.) In July of 1977 Hyacinth Thrash and her sister Zipporah Edwards, long-time
                    followers of the Reverend Jim Jones, arrived in 
                        Guyana
                    . Little more than a year later "Zip" and 912 other people were dead,
                    and Hyacinth was one of the few survivors of the mass murder/suicide which shocked the world. From
                    more than sixty hours of interviews, Marian K. Towne has assembled the personal history of an
                    elderly black woman who was born in 
                        Alabama
                    , spent the 1920s through the 1950s in segregated 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and joined a church led by Jim Jones in 1957. The first part of Thrash's
                    memoir reveals much about working class black life in a segregated northern city and suggests why
                    Jones, an early proponent of integration and a community activist, appealed to so many people. The
                    second part of the book details the growing level of control Jones exercised over his followers and
                    finally the extreme isolation and appalling living conditions of Jonestown. Scholars such as David
                    Chidester have offered theoretical models for understanding what happened at Jonestown;
                    Thrash's memoir adds the poignant detail of personal experience. Dawn E.

                    limestone industry remains to be written, but Bill McDonald has provided an exceptionally important
                    contribution. McDonald's short account surveys the industry from its crude beginnings to
                    its rise to large prominence by 1900. He shows how the Indiana stone belt, about two miles by thirty
                    miles, from 
                        Bloomington
                     to 
                        Bedford
                    , produced much of the nation's building materials, including the stone for
                    twenty-seven state capitols (Indiana's of course, among them), the Empire State Building,
                    and the Pentagon. McDonald's treatment of the technolocy and business side of limestone is
                    fullest, and he devotes considerable attention to architectural contexts. There is less attention to
                    the workers, the local farmers and immigrant laborers, the carvers and mill men, their families and
                    their lives outside the mills and quarries. In sixty-four pages, however, Bill McDonald has produced
                    the best published account of this fascinating and multifacted industry. James H.
