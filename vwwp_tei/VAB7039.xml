                <p><hi>IS</hi> that true? Have we existed in other states of being as many poets and
                    many nonâpoets dimly conjecture? Is this life our beginning though we know it
                    not to be our ending? or is it only one of a series of existences through which
                    we pass? Now and then flashing reminiscencesâreminiscences of things we know
                    positively not to have happened in this lifeâdart,across our minds, recognition
                    in a smell or a sound of something we have met with, something we have had to do
                    with, somehow, somewhere, somewhen. Whence can such<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7039-002"/> reminiscences, such recognitions come, but from some
                    preâexistence? Our draught of Lethe has not been quite deep enough.</p>
                <p>But even without those dim hintings at recollections of a former state, our utter
                    forgetfulness of ever having been in life, under any form before our present
                    one, is no argument against the existence of such a previous life, for what
                    faintest remembrance have we of our first year? Does any glimmering of memory
                    illumine those days when we lay on our nurse's lap, sprawling, making faces,
                    sucking?</p>
                <p>Are there only a certain number of old souls which continually go in and out of
                    an ever new succession of bodies? And if we did exist in some former state, was
                    it a higher or a lower one? Were we beasts or angels? Have we fallen or
                    risen?</p>
                <p>There is no light <emph>whatever</emph> on the past. Thank God there is in the
                    Future enough to enable us to walk soberly, heedfully, warily, on towards the
                    fuller light, which will dawn on us on thatâ <q>
                        <l>âMarge beyond the tomb.â</l>
                    </q><pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7039-003"/> Southey, in his âDoctor,â makes his hero
                    maintain, half in jest and half in earnest, that he was able to recognize, in
                    the personal appearance, habits and dispositions of many of those around him,
                    the different animals which, in a former state, their spirits had inhabited.</p>
                <p>Truly there is none of us who cannot point out a pig or two, a sheep or a mule,
                    among his acquaintance. If Dolly had ever preâexisted, it must have been in the
                    shape of one of the feline tribe; not a comfortable old tabby sitting staid
                    beside the hearth, and putting up her head to be tickled, but a tigress or a
                    panther, sleek, lithe, beautiful, stealthy. There lacked to her but the eyed
                    skin, the outward beast form; her spirit had remained the pardâspirit of her
                    former life, when she lived in jungles; tangled, torrid swamps, and lay in wait
                    to pounce on deer, and kid, and man.</p>
                <p>Turning day into night, I slept on, till the afternoon, till the sun came round
                    to my side of the house, and woke me, blazing down hot and full on the bed
                    whereon I lay through the uncurtained, unshuttered<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7039-004"/> windows. When I did wake, it was to the consciousness of a sufficiently bad
                    headache. For some little time I lay motionless, on the border land between
                    sleeping and waking; feeling nothing much, wishing nothing much, thinking of
                    nothing much except myself as a mere animal; my headache, my vertigo, and my
                    heat. I was fully roused at length by the door handle turning softly, the door
                    opening, and some one coming in. Some one came over to the bed, and bent over
                    me; some one was Dolly.</p>
                <p>âAwake, are you? have you quite recovered your adventure?â she says, in a key so
                    sweet and low, that it does not jar on my aching cranium, as almost any other
                    sound would. She would make the divinest sick nurse, would Dolly. My senses come
                    back to me, full and strong. Dolly has treated me despitefully; there shall be
                    no peace with her; war to the knife with Dolly. I fixed my eyes steadily upon
                    her, from among my tumbled pillows.</p>
                <p>âI don't want to speak to you,â I said, âyou tell lies!â</p>
                <pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7039-005"/>
                <p>âDo I?â said Dolly, unruffled. âI daresay; I never yet met a person who did not,
                    and I hope I never shall, for they would necessarily be very disagreeable; a
                    certain amount of fibs is essential to the existence of society; did you never
                    hear that?â</p>
                <p>I refuse to be led from the concrete to the abstract.</p>
                <p>âYou made mischief between me and Dick. You prevented him from driving me to
                    Wilton,â I cry, with raised voice, knives running through my head under my
                    exertions.</p>
                <p>âIf Dick, as you call him, has forgiven me, don't you think you might?â she says,
                    gently.</p>
                <p>If Dick had forgiven her! How that quiet implication stung me! I roll my head
                    restlessly from side to side.</p>
                <p>âWhat object could you have had in doing it? Had you any object at all, or was it
                    only pure malice?â</p>
                <p>Dolly smiles and sits down on the side of the bed; she perceives we are going to
                    have a squabble, and she does not see why<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7039-006"/> we
                    should not have it out comfortably.</p>
                <p>âWhat a foolish child you were not to get into bed,â she says with affability;
                    âlying down in one's clothes does not rest one in the least; now, you know,
                    toânight you'll look quite green.â</p>
                <p>âWas it pure malice?â I reiterate, disregarding this digression.</p>
                <p>âNobody but a fiend would think of doing anything out of pure malice, I should
                    say,â returns my sister, sedately, âand I'm not a fiend yet, that I know of;
                    malice had neither part nor lot in the matter.â</p>
                <p>âDid you want to ride with him yourself?â I ask, vehemently; âare
                        <emph>you</emph> fond of him too?â</p>
                <p>Dolly smiles again; a little amused, compassionate smile, and shrugs her
                    shoulders.</p>
                <p>âAm I given to being fond of men, merely for being longâlegged and poor, which I
                    confess seem to me the most salient points in your dear Dick's character?â</p>
                <p>âAny one would have said you thought<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7039-007"/> he had a
                    good many good points in his character, who saw the way you looked at him
                    yesterday,â I cry, choking with indignation.</p>
                <p>âMy dear, did I make my own eyes? Can I help it, if they have any peculiar way of
                    exercising themselves; Providence made them, and Providence must answer for
                    their vagaries.â</p>
                <p>âIf you have such a contempt for poverty, why did you waste so much time and
                    trouble; why did you tell lies, and make me perfectly miserable, merely to get
                    that which, when you had got it, you thought worthless?â I asked bitterly.</p>
                <p>âMy good child, for once I was unselfish; cannot you believe that?â asks Dolly,
                    playfully, and laying her cool slim hand on my burning forehead.</p>
                <p>âI had no plans for myself whatever; certainly no designs on our mutual friend,
                    with the crackâjaw Scotch name; it rather bored me than otherwise ambling along
                    beside him, for heaven knows how many hours, in the broiling sun!â</p>
                <p>I am dumbfoundered, and lie staring at<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7039-008"/> her with
                    boundless wonder in my wideâopen eyes.</p>
                <p>âWhat upon earth did you do it for, then?â I gasp, slowly; âonce for all, tell me
                    what object you had, or whether you had any?â</p>
                <p>âWill you have some Eau de Cologne on your head?â she asks; and as she is
                    sprinkling scented drops over me, âAn object?â says she, âyes, to be sure; who
                    but an idiot ever does anything without an object? I have no objection whatever
                    to tell you mine either, if you'll listen to it like a sensible woman, and not
                    scream at the top of your voice, as you have been doing for the last quarter of
                    an hour; if you <emph>must</emph> know the truth, <emph>I</emph> intended you to
                    drive with Sir Hugh. Was not it charitable of me? he looked so disconsolate,
                    poor little wretch!â</p>
                <p>âWhy did you want me to drive with him?â I ask in blank astonishment.</p>
                <p>âBecause, my dear, I wish and intend that you should drive through life with him;
                    because I hope, before I die, to see you Lady Lancaster.â</p>
                <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7039-009"/>
                <p>â<emph>That</emph> you never will,â I cry, with flaming cheeks, starting up in
                    bed, and fumbling with the counterpane.</p>
                <p>âAh! perhaps not; at present you prefer the idea of riding in the baggageâwaggon
                    after Daddy Longlegs, with several little M'Gregors, male and female, clinging
                    about your skirts!â</p>
                <p>So Dolly, softly inhaling Eau de Cologne as she speaks. I fling myself back among
                    the pillows, and am thankful for the shade afforded by my loosened hairâa shade
                    which partially veils the blush that I feel creeping all over my body.</p>
                <p>âHow coarse you are!â I murmur.</p>
                <p>âVery likely,â says Dolly, âcommon sense always is coarse; but my being ever so
                    coarse won't make the baggageâwaggon an easier mode of conveyance, nor will it
                    pay Romeo and Juliet's butcher's bills.â</p>
                <p>âWhat is it to you whether they are ever paid?â I am emboldened by the protection
                    of my tangled locks to ask; âwhy cannot you let us be happy in our own way?â</p>
                <pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7039-010"/>
                <p>â<emph>Us</emph> be happy, indeed!â says Dolly, a little contemptuously. âAre you
                    so sure about Romeo? because I'm not; Romeo likes coats from Poole; he likes
                    billiards and ChÃ¢teau Lafitte, and actresses; of course he does; he keeps them
                    in the background now, but you are even a greater ninny than I take you for, if
                    you cannot believe that they are there, out of sight somewhere. Will he be
                    content, do you suppose, with poky lodgings and a dirty parlour maid, and
                    shoulder of mutton and rice pudding, even with you to sweeten them?â</p>
                <p>I writhe in silent anguish; but her logic is unanswerable. What equivalent am I
                    for billiards and ChÃ¢teau Lafitte, and actresses?</p>
                <p>âIt's something quite new your taking such an interest in my concerns,â I say
                    presently. âI cannot see what it would matter to you if I were to run away with
                    a tinker.â</p>
                <p>âI don't think a tinker's arms would quarter well with the Lestranges',â says
                    she, laughing, âand I should not like to<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7039-011"/> have
                    to allude to my sister Madame la ChaudronniÃ¨re.â Then falling into gravity
                    again, âI don't pretend to any great disinterestedness in the matter; my motive
                    for endeavouring to prevent your marrying Major M'Gregor, is no particularly
                    tender regard for your interests; it is simply this, that by marrying a pauper,
                    as, from all I can make out, I believe our worthy dragoon to be, you will drag
                    down our family, and me of course with it, even lower than it has already
                    fallen, though it seems pretty nearly at the bottom of the ladder as it is.â</p>
                <p>I toss about restlessly. I feel that there is a flaw somewhere in her worldly
                    wisdom, but I cannot detect it.</p>
                <p>âWhereas,â pursues Dolly, rising and pacing up the room, âif you marry Sir
                    Hughââ</p>
                <p>âNever,â I cry, interrupting her; âI'd rather be flayed alive! Ugh! married to
                    Hugh! I should be dead of disgust in a week! Faugh!â</p>
                <p>Dolly pauses before a chevalâglass, and considers herselfânot with vanityâfor<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7039-012"/> vanity in her was not, but reflectively,
                    appraisingly; looked at her small snaky head; at her coiled cables of inkâblack
                    hair; at her tall, svelte figure.</p>
                <p>âDon't you see, you stupid child, that I'm only giving you the advice that I
                    always give and take myself?â she says. âAm I more in love with Hugh's
                    attractions than you are? not I; as I see him, he's a goodânatured,
                    woodenâheaded old booby; but for all that, if he were to come in here this
                    minute (don't be alarmed, he'd hardly be so illâmannered) and say to me, âMiss
                    Lestrange, will you marry me?â or, âDolly, will you be mine?â wouldn't I
                    respond, âYes, dear Hugh, <emph>that</emph> I will, and thank you kindly;â I'd
                    swear to love, honour, and obey, not <emph>him</emph>, not <emph>him</emph>;
                    (with a gesture of contempt), but his Â£12,000 a year, his French cook, and his
                    operaâbox, and I'd keep my vow, too!â</p>
                <p>âI wish to goodness he <emph>would</emph> ask you!â I groan.</p>
                <p>âIs there,â pursues Dolly, warming with her theme (it's not often she thinks it
                    worth while wasting so much breath on<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7039-013"/> anything
                    female) âis there any old lord between the three seas, so old, so mumbling, so
                    wicked, that I would not joyfully throw myself into his horrid palsied old arms,
                    if he had but money; money! money! money is power; money is a god!â</p>
                <p>I sit with my legs dangling over the side of the bed listening.</p>
                <p>âIt may be yours,â I say; âit is not mine. What do women want with power? What
                    would they do with it when they had got it? Love is worth all the power in the
                    world!â</p>
                <p>âPooh! I did not know that any one after sixteen or before sixty, believed in
                    that venerable old imposture nowâaâdays; love is another name for selfishness!â
                    says Dolly, recommencing her walk, and sweeping up and down.</p>
                <p>âIt cannot be selfishness to live altogether in and for another person,â object
                    I, thinking that I have nailed her there.</p>
                <p>âWorldly wisdom and sordid common sense,â continues she, âwould make you marry
                    Hugh, sacrifice your own passions, give a lift to the poor old family, the <choice>

                    isn't itâand relieve him of more than half his cares; on the other hand,
                        <emph>Love</emph>, noble, beautiful, beâpoetized <emph>Love</emph>, will
                    make you hurl yourself at the not particularly delighted head of that big

                    your passion will be gratified; you will be put in possession of that very
                    luxuriant moustache, and those very broad shoulders, and having them, you can
                    afford to let papa's âgrey hairs go down with sorrow to the grave,â as
                    somebody's in the Bible did; cannot you, dear?â</p>
                <p>She opens the door and passes out; I call after her, âDolly, Dolly, come back!â

                <p>â<hi>MACBETH</hi> has murdered sleep!â and Dolly had murdered mine. Much good to

                    resolutely to the continuation of one's unfinished snooze; much good to think of
                    a key, or the wards of a lock, or the legs of a chair, or anything else as
                    intensely unexciting.</p>
                <p>I am Orestes, and Dolly has hounded on the Erinnyes on my track. My Furies
                    areâlike the original ones that pursued Orestes,âthree in number, viz.: Dick's
                    poverty, as impeding our union, and docking his luxuries, (of which I grudged
                    him but one item), not as affecting myself, for from my youth up I had been
                        hard<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7039-016"/> up, and should not have known what it
                    felt like to be otherwise: Dick's jealousy of Hugh, and Dick's flirtation with
                    Dolly.</p>
                <p>I had not sense enough to see that I need not worry myself about all three at
                    once; since any two of them were exclusive of the third, as for example, that if
                    Dick was going to jilt me, his want of money would in nowise prejudice me: be
                    rather a matter of rejoicing,âor, that if Dick was jealous of Hugh, he was the
                    less likely to be in love with Dolly.</p>
                <p>All three of them, MegÃ¦ra, Tisiphone, and Alecto, crowd their ugly faces round,
                    and grin at me, and I have not strength to combat them.</p>
                <p>After about a quarter of an hour, which seems to me about two full hours, I jump
                    up. I have no watch, as you know, but I hear a clock ticking on the landing
                    outside. I open the door, and peep out. Only five o'clock! An hour and a half
                    till dressing time! I will go down. Fortune favours the brave, and I suppose
                    also the fair, as they are mostly put in the same category, and I
                        <emph>might</emph> meet Dick in the passages, or<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7039-017"/> the stairs, in the billiardâroom; as Christabel says,
                    âAll may yet be well!â (though that is rather an illâomened quotation, for all
                    was not well in <emph>her</emph> case), and at the worst, the society of my
                    fellowâcreatures, even though they are not <emph>Dicks</emph>, is pleasanter
                    than my own.</p>
                <p>At the morningâroom door I stop and listen; not with any eavesâdropping
                    intention, but simply to try and detect those tones that I foolishly imagine
                    would wake me âHad lain for a century dead!â Lain for a century dead indeed! It
                    is all very well, and a pretty conceit to say so in a love song, but it will
                    require a louder than human voice to reâform those scattered dust particles into
                    the marvellous image, of which the great God Himself condescended to be the
                    model.</p>
                <p>The tones I seek are not detectable; I hear instead ever so many women's voices;
                    young and old, croaky and mellow. Nearly all the women, half of the Wentworth
                    party, is scattered about the many cornered room, in groups of twos and threes.
                    Each is provided with a cup of tea, and all<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7039-018"/>
                    have apparently just come in from walking; judging by the large show of Mrs.
                    Heaths' and Mrs. Browns' hats that are lying about, and by the display of a
                    great many pairs of trimmest Balmorals. Lady Capel (the fat Viscountess) stands
                    by the table, in a charming little pointâlace bonnet, chatting with Miss
                    Seymour. I think it makes her feel comfortable to look at anything so thin.</p>
                <p>She has had the post of honour this afternoon; and has been out driving with Lady
                    Lancaster in the sociable. Honour and pleasure are not Siamese twins in this
                    world. Our hostess also bonneted (in the literal and not metaphorical sense), is
                        <emph>buttonâholeing</emph> another philanthropic old woman, on the subject
                    of the Shoe Black Brigade. As I come in, she turns round and utters an
                    exclamation of surprise, âCome down after all! So glad! Your sister gave us such
                    a sad account of you, that we were afraid we were going to lose you for all the
                    evening; there does not seem much the matter now, does there?â patting my cheek
                    as she would have patted<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7039-019"/> the cheek of the
                    Hottentot Venus, if Sir Hugh had seen fit to throw his Sultanic Majesty's
                    pocketâhandkerchief to her.</p>
                <p>âYou are quite a heroine, my dear!â says Lady Capel kindly, âwe are all dying to
                    hear your version of this unlucky <foreign xml:lang="fre">contretemps</foreign>!â</p>
                <p>âMen are so stupid!â cries the sharp young lady, whose name is Miss Gifford,
                    coming over from the other side of the room, âthey never know how to tell a
                    story; they always leave out all the details, which are the most important
                    parts.â</p>
                <p>âIt must have been a great shock, andâ<emph>very</emph> embarrassing,â says Miss
                    Seymour, in that whinyâpiny voice, with which an inscrutable Providence has seen
                    fit to visit her.</p>
                <p>âI should have put on my sevenâleague boots, and set off walking home!â says Miss
                    Gifford smartly. She would have done nothing of the kind, as indeed she would
                    have given all her back hair, and two or three of her fingers for a six or seven
                    hours' nocturnal tÃªteâÃ âtÃªte with Sir Hugh.</p>
                <pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7039-020"/>
                <p>âIt was very fortunate that it was not one of the other young men,â says Lady
                    Lancaster, stiffly; âit certainly was a trying position for a young woman to be
                    placed in; and you could not have found yourself in better hands than my
                    son's.â</p>
                <p>I receive this assurance in silence, and bite my lips. Perceiving that I am
                        <foreign xml:lang="lat">pro. tem.</foreign> a small lion, and am expected to
                    roar in my humble way, I execute a slight <foreign xml:lang="fre">mugissement</foreign>. âI don't know much about it, except that the horses
                    were frightened at the trainâthey had been rather frisky all along, I
                    thoughtâand then they ran away, and upset me into the hedge bank. I don't know
                    where they upset anybody else, and then I suppose I fainted, for I don't
                    recollect anything else, until I woke up in that innâparlour. Ugh!â (with a
                    shiver of aversion at the remembrance.)</p>
                <p>âPoor child, it must have been very disagreeable!â Lady Capel says
                    goodânaturedly, fat women mostly are goodânatured, whether it is a cause or an
                    effect I cannot say.</p>
                <p>âDreadful!â I answer emphatically,<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7039-021"/> âI never was
                    so miserable in my life!â Lady Lancaster takes my emphasized remark as a
                    personal affront.</p>
                <p>âYou should have been very thankful, my dear, that your life was spared,â she
                    says rather rebukingly, âand that you were with a person Who would be sure to
                    take such excellent care of you!â</p>
                <p>âWhat on earth did you do all those hours?â puts in Miss Gifford, rather quickly,
                    to save us a sermon, âtalk, or go to sleep, or play picquet! oh, I suppose they
                    had not such a thing as a pack of cards in the house, had they?â</p>
                <p>âI looked at Sir Hugh's watch half the time, and read an awful book about the End
                    of the World, and the Third Vial the other half,â I answer rather grimly.</p>
                <p>They all laugh except Lady Lancaster.</p>
                <p>âWhat a picture!â âHow wretched!â âI cannot imagine anything more dreary!â âAnd
                    what did Sir Hugh read? Drelincourt on Death?â (this is from Miss Gifford).</p>
                <p>âHe read nothing!â</p>
                <pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7039-022"/>
                <p>âPoor man! he was worse off than you even; how did he amuse himself then? smoked?
                    took a nap?â</p>
                <p>âHe did nothing, he sat quiet.â</p>
                <p>âYou don't seem to have been very sociable,â remarks Miss Gifford, with
                    sprightliness, ânor to have taken much pains to entertain one another.â</p>
                <p>My thoughts fly back to poor Hugh's well meant efforts to entertain me, and I
                    feel myself blushing.</p>
                <p>âDid nobody miss us?â I ask hastily, fiddling with my tea cup, âwas no one ever
                    coming to look for us?â</p>
                <p>âOh, I believe there were people hunting for you all over the country half the
                    night, only they did not manage to find you somehow; weren't there Lady
                    Lancaster?â</p>
                <p>âThey went the wrong road,â replies our hostess, sitting very upright, and
                    looking over her spectacles, âthat was how the mistake arose. Hugh never was
                    known to come by that lower road in his life before; it is three miles longer
                    too; I cannot imagine what possessed him.â</p>
                <pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7039-023"/>
                <p>I <emph>can</emph> imagine, and I dive under the table after an imaginary
                    pocketâhandkerchief.</p>
                <p>âAren't you very much shaken and bruised?â asks Miss Seymour, making up her face
                    into a sympathetic shape.</p>
                <p>âOh, yes! I'm black and blue from top to toe.â</p>
                <p>âMy dear child! why did not you say so before?â says Lady Lancaster, very kindly,
                    though fussily, as 'tis her nature to, âand I would have sent my maid with some
                    arnica for you; it's the best thing in the world for contusions and sprains, and
                    anything of that sort. I'm afraid, dear, that if you are so stiff and sore, you
                    will not be equal to much dancing <choice>
                        <corr>toânight</corr>
                        <sic>to night</sic>
                    </choice>.â</p>
                <p>âDancing!â repeat I, pricking up my ears, as a horse does, when in the distance
                    he hears the horn and the hounds giving tongue.</p>
                <p>âHaven't you heard of it?â says Lady Capel, âwhy, we have all been on the
                        <foreign xml:lang="fre">qui vive</foreign> all day about it; we have been
                    making decorations, and hanging up flags<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7039-024"/> and
                    standing on stepâladders ever since breakfast, haven't we?â</p>
                <p>My thoughts revert to my one ball, and Captain Dashwood, who has become a very
                    hazy mist figure of late. He was a âheavyâ too. I seem fated to be the prey of
                    the Cavalry.</p>
                <p>âWe are not very dancing people generally,â Lady Lancaster says in her stately
                    slow way, âit is many years since there was a ball in this house; it was quite a
                    sudden thought, but my son thought perhaps it would amuse the young people.â</p>
                <p>âHow very kind of him,â I say very gratefully, while my eyes begin to shine like
                    carriage lamps.</p>
                <p>âIt is quite a small affair! only nine or ten couples, but everybody is in
                    town.â</p>
                <p>Lady Capel sighs. Fain, fain would she be there too, but the Newmarket Stud, and
                    a long course of pointâlace bonnets have necessitated the letting of the
                    Capellian mansion in Park Lane this season.</p>
                <p>âSmall impromptu dances are always the pleasantest,â she says politely, âthe<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7039-025"/> only thing is that in the country gentlemen
                    are not to be had for love or money.â</p>
                <p>âIt is indeed very true!â says Lady Lancaster, shaking her head, and her marabout
                    feathers with it, as solemnly as if it had been <emph>question</emph> of the
                    famine in India. âThe young men of the present day cannot be content to stay at
                    home and look after their properties; they must be running about to Egypt and
                    Palestine, and half a dozen other places that they never thought of in my
                    younger days,â (very likely not, for it took eighteen months to get to India in
                    her younger days.) âI consider that it's quite one of the greatest evils of this
                    generation; one of the signs of the latter days!â</p>
                <p>âA very unpleasant sign!â think I, if it is to entail a Spurgeonic dance on me
                    this evening. Lady Capel sees my countenance falling.</p>
                <p>âYou need not be afraid of lacking partners,â she says, nodding to me; âfor I
                    heard Sir Hugh saying that he had invited a number of the Scots Greys over from
                    Nantford.â</p>
                <pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7039-026"/>
                <p>âMy son is a host in himself,â says Lady Lancaster; âhe is a very energetic
                    dancer!â</p>
                <p>There is nothing, from the writing a book on the Differential Calculus to making
                    cabbage nets, that âmy sonâ cannot do in his mother's opinion.</p>
                <p>âHow many are we in the house?â says Miss Gifford counting. âSir Hugh, one, Lord
                    Capel, two. Does <emph>he</emph> dance, Lady Capel?â</p>
                <p>âWhen he is wanted; he does not think it fair to stand in the young men's
                    light!â</p>
                <p>The dressing bell rings.</p>
                <p>âDear me! I had no idea that it was so late!â</p>
                <p>âWe dine at seven toâday,â says Lady Lancaster, explanatorily, and then we all
                    separate to make ourselves beautiful for the Scots Greys.</p>

                <p><hi>WE</hi> are to dance in the dining room; the hall has a stone floor, and Lady
                    Lancaster objects to the dismantling of any of the other rooms; consequently we
                    are to dine in the hall. Lady Lancaster makes many apologies to us; hopes we
                    don't mind, but we must be prepared to rough it a little, which means that we
                    are to eat a first rate Russian dinner, and drink unexceptionable wines half an
                    hour earlier than usual, and in a different but equally comfortable room to that
                    in which we usually feast.</p>
                <p>Blessed! for ever blessed! be the manner and custom which compels the host to
                    take the woman of highest rank into dinner. In no company more exalted than that
                    to be found in an almshouse, or<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7039-028"/> a charity
                    school, am I likely to be the woman of highest rank, so, for once, I escape
                    Hugh. Though he manÅuvres to have me on his other side, I counterâmanÅuvre and
                    more successfully to avoid him. Fate assigns me the young gentleman with the
                    death's head studs, Mr. De Laney an artless child who helps to make the British
                    Grenadier, <q>
                        <l>âThe terror of the Umbrian,</l>
                        <l>The terror of the Gaul,â</l>
                    </q> and who prattles away to me about Windsor and Canada, and muffins, and
                    skating on the Rink, and shooting Cariboo. Dick is on the same side of the
                    table, further down. By leaning back in my chair, and peeping behind my
                    guardsman, the widow, the sceptic, and Miss Gifford, I catch a glimpse of a
                    broadcloth back, and a yellow love lock or two; he has been dipping his head in
                    cold water, apparently, for it is curling more furiously than ever. But neither
                    a man's backâhair nor his back afford much insight into the state of his temper
                    and feelings. I certainly neither<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7039-029"/> lived to eat,
                    nor ate to live that day; great excitement is utterly exclusive of hunger.</p>
                <p>âNo, thanks! no, thanks! no, thanks!â say I again and again, as gorgeous
                    gentlemen in plush and calves, poke fish and flesh, and fowl, in every
                    appetizing disguise under my nose.</p>
                <p>âAre you a Catholic, Miss Lestrange?â asks my little boy at last. He is not a bad
                    little boy; cheery and equally ready for a Fenian invasion, and a valse with a
                    pretty girl.</p>
                <p>âNo; why?â ask I, opening my big eyes.</p>
                <p>âBecause it seems to be a Fast Day with you, and it <emph>is</emph> Wednesday, so
                    I thought you must be a Holy Roman.â</p>
                <p>I laugh a little.</p>
                <p>âNo; only I'm not hungry.â</p>
                <p>âI'm afraid you are seedy.â</p>
                <p>âNo, I am not.â</p>
                <p>âDancing is very hard work; one requires a great deal of support to stand it at
                    all!â with a grin on his jolly wide mouth, and he acts as if he believed what he
                    said. Not even our brave defenders<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7039-030"/> can eat for
                    ever, however; about ten o'clock we are most of us gathered in the drawingâroom.
                    The men are struggling into their gloves; one, who pretends that he takes
                    ladies' size, has burst one pair, and is on the eve of bursting a second; two or
                    three of the youngest and conceitedest have retired to endue fresh ties.</p>
                <p>Carriages are beginning to be heard; the Coxes are the first to arrive. Horses
                    next door to thoroughâbred, that must not be kept standing one second; a coat of
                    arms as big as a dinner plate on each panel; cockaded servants, (for Mr. Coxe is
                    a volunteer, and inexpressibly laughable the podgy little millionaire looks
                    going through the gooseâstep, and shouldering arms, in his invisible green
                    uniform;) this is the way in which the British tradesman visits his friends in
                    these happy days.</p>
                <p>Mr. and Mrs. Coxe make their entry <emph>armâinâarm</emph>, and as they are both
                    fat kine, they have some difficulty in getting through the door. Mr. Coxe has on
                    that crimson velvet waistcoat, from which not all the prayers, tears, and
                    entreaties of his wife<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7039-031"/> and daughters can avail
                    to divorce him.</p>
                <p>Behind the parent birds come the pullets and cockerel; Mortimer Spencer De Lacy
                    Coxe, Gentleman Commoner at Oxford, with his name down for Boodle's, the âJunior
                    Conservative,â and half a dozen other crack Clubs, but of the shop, shoppy, with
                    his sister Amaryllis and the rear brought up by Lily, who has the highest
                    colour, and Violet, who has the loudest voice in Aâshire. Lady Lancaster in her
                    pearlâgray satinâMrs. Coxe's pink moireâantique cost just as much a yard, but it
                    has not the same imposing effect,ârises and says very majestically, âHow do you
                    do, Mrs. Coxe?â It is the first time that the Coxes' have been within the doors
                    of Wentworth, and I think for a minute or two they wish themselves well out of
                    them again.</p>
                <p>Despite my distaste for old women, I cannot help admiring the old lady. She is
                    like an old queen receiving a deputation from some of her faithful burgesses.
                    She is a tiresome old woman, and teases one's life out about the Zulu Indians
                    and the<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7039-032"/> Millenium and âmy son,â but she is a
                    lady to the backbone. Coxes may buy up the old houses and the poor old lands,
                    and almost the old pedigrees, but they cannot buy the âgrand air.â Hugh has not
                    got the grand air, but he has a very goodânatured air, which has more the knack
                    of making people feel comfortable than his mother's grand one.</p>
                <p>âDye do, Miss Coxe? very glad to see you! Dye do Miss Lily? I hope you feel equal
                    to a great deal of exercise toânight, for we don't intend to let you go home
                    till this time toâmorrow.â Then the Scots Greys arrive in their drag;
                    halfâaâdozen of them come herding into the room, knowing no one, and hanging
                    together like a swarm of bees.</p>
                <p>Hugh takes them up, and presents them to his parent, who shakes hands with the
                    Colonel, and executes a magnificent reverence to the others, which reverence
                    frightens one cornet of a timid disposition and tender years nearly into
                    fits.</p>
                <p>Then the arrivals come thick and fast; people who do not go to town at all;
                        and<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7039-033"/> people whose purses are only equal to a
                    month or six weeks at the height of the season, and who, consequently, have not
                    taken flight yet. Papa and mamma, boys and girls, here they all are.</p>
                <p>About halfâpast ten, Sir Hugh gives Lady Capel his arm, and leads her to the
                    dancing room; each man chooses the woman he loves, or the woman to whom he has
                    just been introduced, or the woman whose father has asked him to dinner, and we
                    all troop after them.</p>
                <p>I don't wish to see a more cheery scene than the Wentworth
                    diningâroomâtransmogrified with pink calico and union jacks, and wreaths of
                    evergreens and flowers, till it hardly knows itselfâpresented that evening, just
                    before the dancing commenced, when the waxlightsâbecomingest of lightsâwere all
                    lit and blazing softly, mellowly, from their sconces along the walls where
                    dresses were rustling gently, and there was a buzz of talking; when the
                    hookânosed chaperones, (why, I wonder, do the noses of most British matrons at a
                    certain period become<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7039-034"/> hooks?) in their many
                    coloured silks and satins were settling down on their benches, like a flock of
                    brilliant but venerable tropical birds, contented with the prospect of an
                    evening of vicarious enjoyment, and looking forward with trusting faith to the
                    supper hour; when all the girls, with one or two hopeless exceptions, were
                    looking pretty, and when the fiddlers were tuning up and causing their
                    instruments to emit queer little squeaks, discordant prelude to a harmonious
                    afterâpiece. My faithful Grenadier boy has bidden me for the first dance, which
                    turns out to be a quadrille, rather to his disgust.</p>
                <p>âI did not mean to ask you for one of those stupid square things!â he says, âit's
                    the worse compliment you can pay a woman to ask her for a quadrille!â</p>
                <p>âFor the <emph>last</emph> quadrille,â I say laughing. âYou have not done that at
                    all events!â</p>
                <p>Sir Hugh has been rushing about wildly, saying a civil thing to each of the
                        old<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7039-035"/> women, and making goodâhumoured jokes
                    to a percentage of the girls; now he comes up to me, where I sit on a scarlet
                    bench alone.</p>
                <p>âYou are engaged for this next valse, <emph>of course</emph>?â</p>
                <p>âYes.â</p>
                <p>âIs not it anybody that you can cut?â</p>
                <p>âOh, no! no!â</p>
                <p>âGive me the next then, won't you? we have made it up, haven't we?â</p>
                <p>âI did not know that we had ever quarreled!â</p>
                <p>âAll right then; <emph>mind</emph> you keep it for me.â</p>
                <p>He writes his name on my card, as men always do write on these occasions, so that
                    no human being could decipher it, and then rushes back to his duties. I told Sir
                    Hugh a fib; I am not engaged for the next dance. Several people have asked me
                    for it, but I have told the same fib to them all; I am keeping it for one who
                    does not seem inclined to come and claim it. There is a little pause between<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7039-036"/> the two dances; a little lull between two
                    pleasant storms; people seem to be shaking up together very comfortably. The
                    strange warriors have made acquaintance with some of the native women, and are
                    exchanging beads and lookingâglasses.</p>
                <p>The Miss Coxes are in great request; Miss Violetâsuch a jolly girl! it does not
                    in the least matter what you say to herâis holding a little court near the door,
                    well away from Lady Lancaster; her <foreign xml:lang="fre">bon mots</foreign> do
                    not reach me, but the applause that follows them does. Close to me, the young
                    man with the catarrh is coughing noisily; his cold has taken a new turn; he can
                    pronounce his M's and N's, but he has purchased that power at the expense of as
                    roaring a cough, as the poor lady's in the epitaph.</p>
                <p>âIf you would but try jujubes,â I hear Miss Seymour saying, with feeling.</p>
                <p>âNo good at all!â replies the sufferer, huskily. âI've eaten a box and a half
                    already.â</p>
                <p>He seems very sorry indeed for himself<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7039-037"/> as men
                    always do, if they have a fingerache.</p>
                <p>âGo to byeâbye, my dear fellow, I advise!â says little De Laney heartlessly; âput
                    your feet in gruel and drink hot water, and you'll be all serene toâmorrow
                    morning.â</p>
                <p>The invalid looks cross, and mutters something about it's being all very
                    fine.</p>
                <p>âNot fine at all! if you intend going on barking that way all the evening, for
                    you'll drown the band,â and then he goes off laughing.</p>
                <p>âI'm afraid you'll think me a very fidgetty old woman,â says Lady Lancaster to a
                    young matron, who has inadvertently placed herself near an open window, âbut
                    aren't you a little imprudent to be sitting in such a thorough draught? nothing
                    so likely to give cold; we old people have learnt by bitter experience you know,
                    particularly when <foreign xml:lang="fre">dÃ©colletÃ©</foreign> tooââ</p>
                <p>I hear no more, for the band clashes out; big fiddle and little fiddle, harp and
                    bones, off they go. There is a movement among the company; nonâdancers
                        clearing<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7039-038"/> out of the way, men looking for
                    their partners.</p>
                <p>My heart begins to beat so fast, that I feel choking. âPerhaps he cannot see me
                    where I am sitting.â I stand up, and push gently forwards into the front of the
                    circle forming round the dancers, while my legs tremble under me.</p>
                <p>The ice is broken; one adventurous couple has set off on their course of insane
                    gyrations, quickly followed by another and another, till the whole room is
                    filled with whirling clouds of tulle and tarletan, enveloped in which, manly
                    legs vanish to reâappear meteorâlike for an instant and then be swallowed up
                    more completely than before. I dig my fingers into my poor bruised arm, and
                    don't feel the pain I am inflicting on myself one bit. âWon't he come? won't he
                    come? Oh, how cruel he is!â Suddenly an opening is made in the spectators, to
                    admit a fresh couple, <emph>such</emph> a handsome couple.</p>
                <p>âHallo! how's this?â cries Hugh, coming up behind, âhas your partner forgotten
                    you?â</p>
                <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7039-039"/>
                <p>âIâI believe so,â with my lips trembling.</p>
                <p>âNever mind, there's as good fish in the sea, as ever came out of it; you'll have
                    to put up with me, after all.â</p>
                <p>âOh, no! no!â I cry, turning my shoulder to him; âI don't want, please not.â</p>
                <p>Sir Hugh is rather obtuse.</p>
                <p>â<emph>You</emph> a wallflower of all people! couldn't think of such a
                    thing.â</p>
                <p>I have not spirit to resist further, nor can I trust my voice, so we join the
                    whirl, and whirl too. Hugh dances well; does it with all his heart, and mind,
                    and soul, and strength, as he does everything he puts his hand toâthe great
                    secret of his happy cheery life is that he never does anything by halves. I get
                    giddy at last, so we stop and watch our neighbours spinning away like so many
                    peg tops, to the sound of âIl Bacio.â</p>
                <p>Some dance in time; some dance out; some dance hoppily, like parched peas; some
                    dance smoothly; some go jog trotting along, like old cart horses to market;<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7039-040"/> some go racing pace. Amaryllis Coxe and a long
                    gawky, all arms and legs, come floundering into us.</p>
                <p>âOh, I beg your pardon; I hope I did no harm.â Then lumber off again;
                    hobbleâdeâgee, hobbleâdeâgee. Another couple passes us; racers these; and I bite
                    my lip till it bleeds, as I look after them. Dolly in maize tulle, and
                    pomegranates in her hair; smooth cheeks like living rose leaves; her scarlet
                    lips half apart, is floating down the long room, lying restfully in Dick's arms,
                    with her head on his shoulder. Dolly has a most reprehensible style of dancing;
                        <emph>I</emph> think though Dick does not seem to think so, as they swim
                    fleetly round, with the most complete agreement in their supple movements. Dolly
                    is the sort of woman, upon whom Mr. Algernon Swinburne would write pages of
                    magnificent uncleanness.</p>
                <p>âWhere were we this time last night, eh?â roars Hugh sentimentally, for we are
                    close to the recess where the band is placed,</p>
                <p>âI'm rested!â I say, abruptly; I <emph>cannot</emph><pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7039-041"/> stand any tender reminiscences. So that dance ends,
                    and another and another follow quickly.</p>
                <p>The patient chaperones sit biding their time, like a row of old hens, roosting in
                    a hen house, with here and there a superâannuated chanticleer crowing feebly to
                    enliven them. A knot of men hang about the door, talking <emph>horsily</emph>
                    and <emph>doggily</emph>, and fling out a careless word of commendation in the
                    equine tongue, as some filly, more promising than ordinary flies by, wafting
                    twenty yards of tulle against their faces.</p>
                <p>âWhy aren't you taking a more active part in these gay doings?â asks the naughty
                    old gentleman, who is known amongst men by the name of Sir Phillip Leroy to the
                    widowed Mrs. Marryat, who has effected an ingenious compromise between the
                    memory of the enskied one, and the desire not to let grief be too disfiguring in
                    the eyes of his successor in <foreign xml:lang="lat">posse</foreign>, by a
                    judicious combination of the funeral black and the bridal white in her
                    attire.</p>
                <p>â<emph>I</emph>! Oh, no! no!â with a glance at her black dress, and a sigh.</p>
                <pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7039-042"/>
                <p>âPerhaps,â (letting himself gently down on the bench beside her,) âperhaps you
                    object to the pleasant knocking down of oldâfashioned barriers in the present
                    style of dancing; it certainly is what would have been called in
                        <emph>our</emph> younger days,â(How to write a whisper), don't you think
                    so?â</p>
                <p>âTake care! take care! somebody will hear you.â</p>
                <p>I have been guiding heavy youths who <emph>would</emph> give their left hand,
                    when they ought to give their right, and their right hand when they ought to
                    give their left through the labyrinth of the Lancers, and the mazes of the gay
                    quadrille. Men seem to like fern wreaths, and red heads, and ignorance. It is
                    quite a new light to myself that I am a beauty, but I am so fortunate as to
                    overhear that the bay filly is considered quite one of the best things out. I
                    have been scampering round the room with almost every man in it, with one
                    melancholy exception.</p>
                <p>Dick has been scampering largely too; with the three Miss Coxes of course; a
                    quadrille with Mrs. Coxeâwho makes her<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7039-043"/> steps
                    and chassÃ©'s, as the world chassÃ©d in the days when she was Miss Martha
                    Harrisâwith Miss Gifford, Miss Seymour and half a dozen other Misses; then again
                    with Dolly.</p>
                <p>âI so seldom meet anyone whose step suits mine; it <emph>is</emph> such a treat!â
                    I hear Dolly saying very softly, while she looks at him as I fancy Dalilah
                    looked at Samson, when she tried to wile the secret of his strength from him.
                    Dolly reminds me of <q>
                        <l>âââThe maid of Cassivelaun,</l>
                        <l>Whom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers.â</l>
                    </q> âSandy! The canny Scott! Daddy Longlegs!â say I to myself indignantly,
                    recalling all the ignominious epithets that she had heaped on the man, at whom
                    she is now looking with the eyes of a hundred âLaisesâ rolled into one. Oh, if I
                    could but tell him! How I wish that she had had the smallâpox in her youth; she
                    might have been a good, worthy, useful woman then; making flannel waistcoats for
                    poor people; wheeling the old dad's chair to the fire for him, and being my
                    confidant.</p>
                <p>The room is getting so hot; too much<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7039-044"/> of a good
                    thing is as undesirable as a little of a bad one; the smell of the gillyâflowers
                    and roses is getting past a joke; it makes one's head ache and one almost wishes
                    to exchange it for a little bonedust or guano. Some oneâa young personâopens a
                    window, and some oneâan old person, Lady Lancaster, I think it isâshuts it
                    again. Lady Lancaster has that rooted aversion to fresh air, which characterized
                    the last generation.</p>
                <p>The girls fan themselves vigorously, and the men mop their foreheads, and a
                    whisper goes through the room that the door of the supperâroom is open. Unhappy
                    Patres Conscripti who have been dragged hither at their wives âchariot wheels,â
                    begin to console themselves with the reflection that their sufferings are at all
                    events half over.</p>
                <p>âCome, Capel, you lazy beggar!â says Sir Hugh coming up, and tapping that
                    ornament to the Peerage on the back; âwhy don't you make yourself of some use?
                    take one of those old girls down to supper with you; oh, yes, there is Mrs.<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7039-045"/> Coxe; take her; won't she âmy lordâ you!â</p>
                <p>âWhat, that female Daniel Lambert! No, no, my good fellow; it makes one hot to
                    look at her; and I'm 92 in the shade, as it is!â</p>

                    to receive the reward of her faith. The musicians retire to refresh themselves,
                    and I need hardly say that the man who plays the bones gets drunk.</p>
                <p>âBeen to supper?â asks Hugh, who is conveying one of the first detachment back
                    again.</p>
                <p>I have freed myself from all my admirers, and am sitting in a humpedâup,
                    disconsolate attitude like a fowl on a wet day.</p>
                <p>âNo, I don't want any!â looking down uneasily, and plucking at the wooden
                    bracelet that adorns my left wrist.</p>
                <p>âOh, nonsense! we must have half a dozen more spins byâandâbye. I have got

                <p>Mother waggles her old head, while the family diamonds (even <emph>they</emph>
                    don't render me unfaithful to Dick) make a restless light on her withered neck,
                    and says âNo, indeed!â she is always an advocate for a good deal of nourishment
                    for young people.</p>
                <p>For the second time, I am vanquished, and am walked off to the supper room, where
                    I find my fellow creatures like cattle before rainâ <q>

                    throat, and champagne that is of all drinks the one most abhorrent to me. The

                <p>I get so weary at last of the everlasting âtum te tum! tum te tum!â The room is
                    getting strewn with long strips and fragments of gauze and tulle; and the

                    gone from their faces and their toilettes; there is something of the Bacchante,
                    I always think, in the look of a woman at the end of a hard fought ball; the men
                    wear better, but they look rather limp too, and inclined like La Motte FouquÃ©'s
                    âOndineâ to melt away into running brooks.</p>
                <p>âThat's in honour of me!â says little De Laney, as the âGuards' Waltzâ peals out,
                    and we prepare to embark on it, âa very pretty compliment of Lancaster's isn't
                    it?â</p>

                <p>Amaryllis is candour and generosity's self in the display of her anatomy. One
                    faint gleam of hope comes to me that evening; but it is like the little yellow
                    glimmer of light that comes out on a hillside in wintry weather, no sooner seen
                    than swallowed up again in the dull murkiness. I am dancing a quadrille, With

                    bed. âI should have thought that to meet Dick at a ball was the acme of human

                <p><hi>I WENT</hi> dinnerless that day at Wentworthâa thing that even in deepest
                    grief one is seldom willing to doâdinnerless, unless the cud of sour and bitter
                    thoughts which I chewed might pass for the festive meal that forms the nucleus
                    of day's dearest interests in most people's lives. Nor did I appear at all till
                    the evening was well on towards ten o'clock. If I had listened to the voice of
                    nature, I should not have appeared at all, but should have retired straightway
                    to bed, and paid the consideration that was due to it, to my most painful
                    occiput. But then we were to leave Wentworth next day, and I could not afford to
                    lose my last chance of reconciliation with Dick.</p>
                <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7039-052"/>
                <p>At all risks, at the risk of my head splitting in two, I must go down to keep a
                    watch upon the wily Dorothea's movements. So I rose, and bathed my cheeks with
                    fresh water, whereby they became and remained as red as the new pulpit cushions
                    in Lestrange Church; I twisted up my hair, and crowned it with a bush of ivy,
                    put on a white frock, girded myself with a rosy sash, and went down.</p>
                <p>I stole into the bilious drawingâroom, in a mouseâlike manner, in the wake of a
                    brace of giant footmen, bearing tea, nor did any one perceive my modest entry.
                    Threeâfourths of the party were, I found, tightly packed round a table, employed
                    in one of the senselessest modes of wasting time, that man (ingenious in
                    frittering away his little day) has ever inventedâa round game.</p>
                <p>Every one was speaking at the utmost pitch of their voices, and laughing with all
                    the force of their lungs. Some were squabbling over counters, some were making
                    oeiliades behind clubs and spades and diamonds, some were facetiously trying
                        to<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7039-053"/> cheat, and others were getting cross
                    with them for so trying.</p>
                <p>Every man spoke, and no man listened. Surely, surely, ombre and quadrille and
                    brag must have been delectabler games than their posterity, commerce and
                    chowâchow, or they never could have seduced the Lady Betty Modishes, Lady
                    Bridgets, and Lady Annes, into keeping such rakish hours, and indulging such
                    naughty passions for their sakes, as we are led by the âSpectatorâ to suppose
                    they did.</p>
                <p>âSympathy, or antipathy?â says Sir Hugh, in his stentor's voice, interrogatively,
                    to the sharp young lady beside him.</p>
                <p>âOh, antipathy!â she answers venomously, âI always say antipathy; it pays much
                    the best, I find.â</p>
                <p>âI like sympathy best; don't you?â sighs Miss Seymour, to a very Anglican young
                    divine, who is beaming over his barnacles, pastorally at her, and her lean
                    collar bones.</p>
                <p>âSix upon sympathy!â</p>
                <p>âSix upon antipathy!â</p>
                <pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7039-054"/>
                <p>âSix upon sympathy!â</p>
                <p>âYou owe me thirtyâsix.â</p>
                <p>âHow do you make that out?â</p>
                <p>âHave ârouge et noir,â Sir Hugh!â</p>
                <p>âDo! it's such fun.â</p>
                <p>âNo, no, <emph>have</emph> blind hookey!â</p>
                <p>âNo, pips!â</p>
                <p>âTake my advice, Lancaster, don't have pips! dealer always loses.â</p>
                <p>Such, and many similar ejaculations, uttered simultaneously, in keys, varying
                    from <foreign xml:lang="ita">forte</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="ita">fortissimo</foreign>, assail my mazed ears. Dick is not among them, Dolly
                    is; Miss Lestrange is off guard; she is a little out of her reckoning, and is
                    enjoying a false security, under the impression that I am tossing in anguish on
                    a bed of pain upâstairs, out of the way of handsome paupers.</p>
                <p>She is no longer the shrewd, worldlyâwise woman of two hours ago, whose
                    sentiments might have been those of a French Marquise of fifty, <foreign xml:lang="lat">temp.</foreign> Louis Quinze, could hardly have belonged to
                    any one younger or less worldâpolluted. She is transformed into the innocentest, <choice>

                    fancy her picking the daisy petals to pieces, to find out whether her lover
                    loved her <foreign xml:lang="fre">un peu, passionÃ©ment</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="fre">point de tout</foreign>.</p>
                <p>The guiltless author of this metamorphosis was a very young cotton lord, with a
                    fleshy nose, and a retreating chin, who was willing enough to be Faust; willing,
                    though not eager, because no young gentleman that is a real young gentleman,
                    ever is eager about anything nowâaâdays.</p>
                <p>Dolly's whole infantine soul was immersed in her miniature speculations; her soft
                    cheeks were flushing shyly, and the full pink lips, and the velvet eyes, were
                    saying, with a triumph of simplicity, âI should like always to be your partner,
                    you bring me such good luck.â The old game! the old game! it wearies me! But
                    where is Richard? Is he dead, or gone to bed? My eyes roam over the yellow sea,
                    but fail to descry him; then I bethink me of the foldingâdoors, and the
                    adjoining saloon.</p>
                <p>Is thatâcan it be the top of a human head appearing above the back of an armâ<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7039-056"/> chair, in the dim distance? It is worth
                    investigating. I investigate. The head is Dick's. Dick lying back, holding a
                    book topsy turvy in his hand, and looking as bored and as sulky as any one of
                    Her Majesty's servants need look.</p>
                <p>âI came to look for <emph>youâDick</emph>!â I say in a small meek voice,
                    diffidently.</p>
                <p>âIndeed! Very good of you, I'm sure!â rising ceremoniously, and trying very hard,
                    but vainly, to be ironical. One must either be, or appear to be, in a good
                    temper, to be successfully ironical.</p>
                <p>âI thought I'd come and try to make friends,â say I conciliatorily.</p>
                <p>âHave you asked Sir Hugh's leave?â says he, acrimoniously.</p>
                <p>âWhat do you mean?â</p>
                <p>âWhat I say.â</p>
                <p>We stand and glare irefully at one another. I cool first. âOh dear, oh dear! how
                    soon Dolly has turned you against me, poor me!â I cry plaintively.</p>
                <p>âYou never were more mistaken in your life; on the contrary, Dolâ, your sister, I
                    meanâtried her best to make excuses for<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7039-057"/> you;
                    said you were young and changeable, and foolish!â</p>
                <p>Who likes being called foolish? none of us mind being called wicked; we take it
                    rather civilly than otherwise; but who does not resent the imputation of folly?
                    âYoung and foolish, am I?â I cry, at white heat; âand what is she, pray? Would
                    you like to know? Shall I tell you: she's a <emph>mean liar</emph>, that's what
                    she is, there?â</p>
                <p>Dick gnaws his moustache savagely; my nervous English displeases him. âCalling
                    names is very easy,â he says, angrily, âblackening another person to whitewash
                    yourself; it's not quite so easy proving your assertions.â</p>
                <p>I come quite close to him, in my eagerness, and lay a hot white hand on his coat
                    sleeve.</p>
                <p>âIs not a liar a person that tells lies?â I ask.</p>
                <p>âOf course.â</p>
                <p>âWell, did not she tell a lie, a villainous black lie, when she told you the day
                    before yesterday that I wanted Hugh to drive me?<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7039-058"/> Don't I hate Hugh? don't I think him the dullest, tiresomest, botheringest,
                    grayâheadedest old fogey that ever existed? She knows I do, and you know I do,
                    only you're bâbâbent on brâbreaking my heart.â</p>
                <p>So I finish with symptoms of imminent whimpering. Exeunt sulks and scowls from my
                    lover's face.</p>
                <p>âIs that true, Nell?â</p>
                <p>âTrue! to be sure it is! Am I a liar, like Dolly?â</p>
                <p>âOn your honour?â</p>

                <p>âYou did not want to drive with him? You are <emph>sure</emph>.â</p>
                <p>âNot I, indeed! I was in such a rage that I would hardly speak to him all the way
                    to Wilton, only he is such a dunderhead that I don't think he perceived it; how
                        <emph>you</emph> ever could have believed such a transparent falsehood,
                    passes my comprehension.â</p>
                <p>The gray eyes look rather ashamed of themselves, but very much pleased all the

                <p>âWas not it natural I should think you'd prefer a rich beggar like him to a poor

                <p>âDoes one value one's friends in proportion to the depth of their money bags? If
                    one did, I should have but a poor opinion of myself and my dear old father,â I
                    say gravely.</p>
                <p>There comes a fresh burst of maniac mirth from the votaries of chowâchow.</p>
                <p>âHe's cheating; he's cheating!â âWill you sell your deal?â âI'll give you

                    âNo thanks; I'll stand!â &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                <p>âCome into the verandah, Nell,â says Dick, taking my most willing fingers in his;
                    âwe cannot hear each other's voices for this Babel, can we?â</p>
                <p>We pass into the verandah upon which the <foreign xml:lang="fre">salon</foreign>
                    âgives,â to use an Anglicised Gallicism. Roses, red and white; roses, fullâblown
                    and overâblown and budding; ruga, with her oldâfashioned scented clusters, and

                    wooden trellis work; clematis weaves her tendrils in amongst them, and jessamine
                    stars stud the deep green of ivy leaves. And through creepers and trellis work
                    the moon looks down, benignant and gracious, and large and full, turning the
                    night into a mellow softened feminine day.</p>
                <p>She fell full on a beautiful passionate face (not mine, I don't mean), and on a
                    form such as one may fancy those were that wrestled in blue and green on the
                    bloody sand of the arena, before the pitiless Roman world, when (the cruel
                    thumbs being turned down) many a gladiatorial Hercules bit the dust. Good God!
                    how happy I was, lying in his arms, and with the top of my tall wreath
                    scratching his handsome nose.</p>
                <p>âI'm a jealous idiot, aren't I, pretty one?â he asks, raining kisses on my lips,
                    thick as leaves in autumn, or the whirling Simois.</p>
                <p>âYes, Dick, I think so.â</p>
                <p>âYou'll never think the same of me again, of course?â</p>

                <p>âOh, no, never!â (shaking my head with solemnity).</p>
                <p>âBut still, bad as I am, you like me a little bit better than Lancaster?â</p>
                <p>âI should like you very little indeed, else.â</p>
                <p>âYou little foolish girl! think of preferring me with twopence a year to him with
                    a fine house, and a handle to his name.â</p>
                <p>âThat's just what Dolly says; as you both say the same thing, there must be some
                    truth in it; but it's never too late to mend, is it? The big house and the
                    handle are still within reach, you know; will you come and see me when I'm Lady
                    Lancaster?â</p>
                <p>âNo, I'm dâd if I will!â</p>
                <p>I see the gray eyes flash in the moonlight at the bare idea of that visit.</p>
                <p>âNelly Lancaster! Eleanor Lancaster! how pretty it sounds!â I cry, pensively,
                    plucking a moon washed rose, and sniffing at it.</p>

                <p>Did she look with love at us two poor fools, who, spendthriftâlike, were
                    devouring our whole portion of bliss in one half hour; that portion, which,
                    spread in a thin layer, over long years, ought to have afforded us a decent
                    competence during our lives. Silent we stood there, passionâdrunk; did we
                    remember then, in our perfect wonderful satisfaction, who it was that has said
                    âthis is not your rest?â The night wind sighs past; it is bearing, perhaps, some
                    weary soul to the land that is very far off, it rocks the heavyâfolded roses,
                    and whispers to us some vague sweet tale that we heed not.</p>
                <p>âOh, Dick!â I murmur, âI wish to God I could die now. I shall never,
                        <emph>never</emph> be so happy again!â</p>
                <p>Dick shudders through his strong young frame.</p>
                <pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7039-063"/>
                <p>âDon't talk of dying, my darling! Your life is only just begun, you poor little
                    child!â</p>
                <p>âM'Gregor! M'Gregor! where are you?â sounds the stentor's voice of our worthy
                    host, breaking prosaically on our touching dialogue at this point. âWhere the
                    devil is the fellow gone?â</p>
                <p>âThe fellowâ makes no sign; he lies as quiet as a partridge between two turnip
                    ridges. Then a dark head and a body issue from the saloon, and step through the
                    French windows, on to the verandah.</p>
                <p>âOh, you're here, are you?â in a voice of anything but gratification at the
                    discovery.</p>
                <p>âYes, my good fellow, you made such a row over your game, all of you, that we had
                    to come out here for a little peace and quietnessâhadn't we?â turning to me,
                    with softened voice, and eyes fondly possessive. I say âyes,â and mumble
                    something, in an indistinct manner, about its being late, and going to bed,
                    andâheadache, and shuffle off, very red in<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7039-064"/> the

                <p><hi>WHY</hi> do I tell my poor little story so circumstantially, I wonder? Will
                    any one care to read it? Is a dissected heart worth looking at, even though it
                    be rather a foolish one? They say that love is the recognizing something of
                    oneself in another person. Will any one, I wonder, recognise in me some of their
                    own foolish fancies and thoughts and notions, and love me for being as silly as
                    themselves, and for owning to them that I am? The old yellowâbodied barouche,
                    and the two victims to spavin and springâhalt, are slowly creeping up âthe long
                    backâ of a hill; the old coachman is flicking spavin's fat flanks gently with
                    his whip, which that worthy beast does not mind a bit. The sunlight lies<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7039-066"/> patchily on the dusty road; here and there a
                    big tree intercepts it, and holds it in his great branches; a little
                    whiteâhaired child stands at a cottage door eating bread and treacle, and
                    clapping his little brown hands at the horses; bees are buzzing drowsily about
                    straw hives; âwineâdarkâ auriculas are blowing in the little borders; a woman is
                    feeding a pig. We are going home; Wentworth lies three miles behind us, and I am
                    thinking of the past, and smiling.</p>
                <p>How plainly I see that group gathered on the stone steps to bid us Godâspeed.
                    Lady Lancaster, in a brown silk so stiff and thick that it could well stand by
                    itself, without the support of her ladyship's body inside it, leaning forward to
                    give me a motherly salute (her beard meanwhile pricking me rather), while she
                    says, in her prim old woman's voiceâ</p>
                <p>âI hope we shall see you very often my dear, <emph>now</emph>!â</p>
                <p>Dolly, with one foot on the carriage step, giving a small, smooth lavender hand
                    to Sir Hugh, and saying goodâbye<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7039-067"/> to him so
                    softly, as if she was so sorry to part from him; Dick, leaning one great
                    shoulder against the doorâpost, and smiling a tender, flickering smile under his
                    heavy moustache, and all around a great glory of sunshine, and young green
                    leaves, and blue summer sky. Dick is going to Cork toâday, to join his regiment
                    (happy, happy Cork!) but he is going to write to me, and I am to write to him;
                    is not this brick and mortar enough to build quite a big Spanish castle with? I
                    am so building now as we jog along in the sleepy sunshine.</p>
                <p>âMy darling! my darling!â I am saying to myself over and over again, like the
                    refrain to a song; âhow I love you!â My hands are clasped together in my green
                    cotton cap, and my eyes are looking up to the grand blue dome above, in a great
                    rapture and gratitude and joy. Was it his beauty I loved him for? Should I have
                    loved him so much if he had been little and black and ugly? If his comely looks
                    were to go away from him now, would my love go away too? No, no,
                        <emph>no</emph>!<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7039-068"/> If he were to lose arms
                    and legs, and eyes and nose and ears, he would still be my Dick, my beautiful,
                    strong King Olaf.</p>
                <p>In my mind I was drawing a little pictureâa little picture with two figures and a
                    dingy backâground. A bare barrackâroom (barrackârooms were always bare, I
                    imagined, and of course we should not be able to afford lodgings) with no
                    curtain, perhaps, and a bit of drugget in the middle of the floor, and a green
                    baize tableâcloth. A good fire though there was in the picture, and an elbow
                    chair beside it; Dick in the elbow chair in full regimentals (I had an adoration
                    equal to any boardingâschoolâmiss's for <q>
                        <l>âThe pomp and circumstance of glorious warâ),</l>
                    </q> and I, on a low stool at his feet, with my arms resting on his knees,
                    looking up alternately at his face and his medalsâmy hero had three of those
                    insigniaâand making little tender speeches to himâspeeches that I never hitherto
                    had summoned resolution to utter.</p>
                <p>When by myself I was eloquent enough,<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7039-069"/> eloquent
                    as Ulysses or Burke, but when with him the passion of his eyes struck me dumb.
                    It would be different when we were married. I should then be able to speak to
                    him without that shy thrill; should be able to tell him what he was to me; to
                    find words to syllable my great pure love.</p>
                <p>Then the scene shifted. Dick was ousted from among the <foreign xml:lang="lat">dramatis personÃ¦</foreign>; I reigned in the elbow chair instead; I,
                    dressed simply yet elegantly, holding a levÃ©e of officers of every grade and
                    standing in Her Majesty's army; colonels, majors, and captains clustering in
                    reverent admiration around me.</p>
                <p>With what modest dignity should I comport myself in my difficult position; with
                    what simple yet spirited answers should I parry their complimentary remarks.</p>
                <p>Married at nineteen! How interesting, and like a storyâbook! Mrs. M'Gregor! Nelly
                    M'Gregor! Major and Mrs. M'Gregor! I would write it down in my blotting book as
                    soon as I got home, to see how it looked.</p>
                <pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7039-070"/>
                <p>I suppose my lips moved visibly as I articulated my own and husband's names
                    softly under my breath, for Dolly, who had not uttered a word before since we
                    left Wentworth, now turned to meâDolly in a neutralâtinted gauzy bonnet, with
                    one bloodâred carnation resting on and contrasting her shiny sombre hair; thus
                    she spoke in her harmoniously round, full tonesâ</p>
                <p>âAre you engaged in prayer?â</p>
                <p>âNo;â said I, rather cross at being roused from my reverie; âwhy on earth should
                    I be?â</p>
                <p>âYour lips were moving, so I thought you might be breathing a short prayer, as
                    people do in the âSunday at Home,â you knowâfor me, perhaps.â</p>
                <p>âNo, I wasn't,â said I; âI was talking to myself, which is much pleasanter than
                    praying; at least I find it so.â (Merciful God! I don't think so now!)</p>
                <p>I turned my head away, and watched the cloudâshadows travelling swiftly over the
                    green wheat fields, turning their laughing golden green into dull blue green as
                        they<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7039-071"/> passed; at the blackbirds gobbling
                    cherries in the farm orchards we were driving by.</p>
                <p>âIs it thinking of its lover?â pursued the angel in the gauzy bonnet.</p>
                <p>âYes,â said I, briefly, âI am.â</p>
                <p>I would not stand any impudence from Dolly any longer, I was resolved. I should
                    soon be a married woman, and able to patronize spinsters all and sundry.</p>
                <p>âSo it has got its big wax doll after all, has it?â asks she, with a sneer,
                    âcurly wig and long legs, and all!â</p>
                <p>I am roused to retort. I turn and rend her.</p>
                <p>âSour grapes!â cry I, with red cheeks, and in an elevated key; âdon't you wish we
                    could sayâ <q>
                        <l>âMiss Jenny and Polly</l>
                        <l>Had <emph>each</emph> a new Dolly?â</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>Dolly smiled sweetly, but her long sleepy eyes gave one little flash.</p>
                <p>âYes, dear, I do,â she said with candour, âonly I don't think I should care about
                    playing dolls in a workhouse, which I fear will be your portion.â</p>
                <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7039-072"/>
                <p>âI believe you would sell your soul for gold,â said I, with my nose in the air,
                    in lofty disdain.</p>
                <p>âI certainly would,â answered my sister, sedately; âone's soul does not do one
                    much good that I could ever find out; if I could have my body left me, my nice,
                    pretty, pleasant body, with plenty of money to keep it well fed and well
                    dressed, I'd give my soul its <foreign xml:lang="fre">congÃ©</foreign> with the
                    greatest <foreign xml:lang="fre">sang froid</foreign> imaginable.â</p>
                <p>I felt feebly shocked at Dolly's sentiments, but too lazily and sovereignly
                    indifferent to what she or her soul said or did to contest the point with her,
                    so we relapsed into silence, and preserved a sort of armed truce, till we
                    reached the rookâhaunted old house blinking sleepily from its ivy mantle amid
                    its sunny crofts, with the grayâblue smoke curling straight up into the air from
                    the queer old chimneyâstacks.</p>
                <p>The library windows at Lestrange look out on the gravelled sweep before the door;
                    smallâpaned, casemented windows they are; and as we passed them I leaned<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7039-073"/> forwards eagerly, to blow kisses at my father,
                    whose face I saw leaning out among the roses and the bowery clematis to greet
                    us. What a sad old face it was! What a yellowing tingeâlike a sere November
                    leaf's tinge, that spake of waning life and waxing sicknessâwas stealing over
                    it. Poor noble old face! how often I see you now in my dreams, looking out from
                    among the fresh pink roseâbunches! I ran to my sire with âeffusion,â and hurled
                    my substantial young person into his arms; he bore the charge with
                    equanimity.</p>
                <p>âWell, little lass!â he said, with his sorrowful smile, sorrowfuller than any
                    tears, âhave you seen a great many fine people, and got a fine new lover, and
                    are you very sorry to come back to the dull old house and the dull old man?â</p>
                <p>âOf course I am,â said I, with a fresh series of ursine hugs; âI should not have
                    come back at all if it had not been that I knew the Cochin cock was to be killed
                    toâmorrow, and I thought I must come back and bid him goodâbye, poor dear fowl,
                    before he died. Come, dad,â I continued,<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7039-074"/>
                    coaxingly, thrusting my arm through his in its threadbare gray coatâsleeve, and
                    dragging him to the door, âlet us come and see the pigs and the chickens, and
                    I'll tell you all about it.â</p>
                <p>So we went, my daddy and Iâwent, and found the doomed chanticleer scratching and
                    scraping peaceably on the dunghill, advertising the treasures he found there,
                    now and again, to his harem, by one lordly cluck. The pigs and we exchanged
                    civilities, and then I began, and narrated all things in order to my parent; how
                    we had gone a picânicing, and how I had been upset out of a dogcart, and how I
                    had fainted, and how funny it felt, and how disagreeable it was spending all the
                    night in that little potâhouse, reading the âGreat Tribulation,â and âwaiting
                    for the waggonâ (my father looked unaccountably grave, I thought, at this stage
                    of my narrative); what a lot there was for dinner every day; what smart gowns
                    old Lady Lancaster had on, with many more interesting particulars concerning the
                    Wentworth <foreign xml:lang="fre">mÃ©nage</foreign>; nor had I the modesty to
                    hide or in any way<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7039-075"/> qualify the fact that Sir
                    Hugh, the middle aged, the desirable, the muchâhunted, was the captive of my bow
                    and spear. Then breath failed me, and I stopped, and threw damaged rice among
                    the chickens.</p>
                <p>âSo you're going to be a great lady, are you, Miss Nelly?â said my father,
                    playfully. âYou won't speak to your poor old father, I suppose, when you are
                    Lady Lancaster!â</p>
                <p>That little bit of news had cheered him wonderfully; he looked less old, less
                    bowed, all of a sudden, somehow. I leaned my elbows on the pigsty wall,
                    reflectively.</p>
                <p>âBut, dad,â objected I, âI've only said that Sir Hugh liked me; I have not said I
                    liked him; that is a very different pair of shoes!â</p>
                <p>My father did not heed my interruption.</p>
                <p>âLancasters and Lestranges!â said he to himself, as if the union of the two names
                    was pleasant to him; âmore like the old times! more like the good old
                    times!â</p>
                <p>A cold chill crept over me, as I thought<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7039-076"/> of the
                    baggageâwaggon, and the barrackâroom, and twopence a year.</p>
                <p>âYou seem very anxious to get rid of me, dad,â said I, picking bits of lichen
                    from between the slatey gray stones. âWhy do you want me to marry Sir Hugh?â</p>
                <p>âMy poor little lass,â said my father very pitifully, âbecause I'm wearing my
                    life out, thinking every day, and all day long, what is to become of you when
                    I'm dead and goneâgone to be with the little mother, Nell; I pray God,â he said,
                    very reverently, taking off his hat; âand also,â he added, a minute afterwards,
                    straightening himself, and looking every inch the proud old gentleman he was,
                    âbecause I believe that to see you raised to your right level again, and doing
                    something towards bringing the old family back into its right position in the
                    county, would add ten years to my life; upon my soul, I think it would!â</p>
                <p>I could not dash his hopesâcould not tell him that I was engaged to a man
                    moneyâless, positionâless, expectationâless;<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7039-077"/>
                    perhaps I ought to have done so, but I could not find it in my heart. So we
                    turned homewards, I a saddened woman, sore perplexed. The chickens still
                    scratched and pecked happily on the dunghill; the pigs grunted in the ineffable
                    content of warmth and repletion; but to me the sunlight had gone out of grass
                    and trees and shining pebbles.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                <p><hi>AM</hi> I wrong in thinking that memory is the cruelest gift ever vouchsafed
                    to man? Perhaps I am wrong to say any gift can be cruel, seeing who it is gives
                    all the gifts, both the sweet and the bitter ones. But I cannot help thinking
                    so. How happy we might be, any of us in our very lowest, forlornest state, if we
                    had no recollection of ever having held a higher joyfuller one. If we had no
                    remembrance of the treasures of love and youth and friendship we once owned, how
                    happy we might make ourselves in the dearth or total absence of those good
                    things. We might bask and roll, oh so lightheartedly in the young spring sun,
                    and sniff at the pretty spring flowers, and drink in the lark's long rhapsody,
                    if the brightness and the sweetness<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7039-079"/> and the
                    melody were not all dashed by the memory of how much grandlier the sun shone,
                    how much fragranter the primroses smelt, how much sweetlier the birds sang long
                    ago, when we had some one to feel and smell and listen with us. For my part, if
                    any fairy were to offer me the choice of a gift, as she did to the hero of the
                    sausage tale, I would not hesitate one minute; I would beg her to give me a
                    great full brimming cup of the wine of forgetfulness, and <emph>how</emph>
                    greedily I would drink it up! Maundering again! How prosy I am getting! I am
                    afraid I am painting the little cabinet pictures of my life too minutely, too
                    elaborately; like a Dutch painter, I am reproducing the cabbages and onions, the
                    pots and pans of everyâday life, <emph>exactly</emph>, and without elevating
                    them.</p>
                <p>If I could, I would fain make a brilliant dashing Turneresque sketch; great
                    breadths of colour, infinite nobility and harmony, in few strokes; but that is
                    above me; if I were to attempt it, I should make but a patchy, blotchy daub. No;
                    I must put in numberless fine lines, carefullest<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7039-080"/> shading and copying, before I can produce anything like Nature; not very like
                    even then.</p>
                <p>Here is another Dutch picture. Dolly's bedâroom; a little sanctuary of innocence
                    and purity, and maidenly breadâandâbuttery thoughts you would say, were you
                    privileged to enter and survey it; a small white bed, spotless enough to shelter
                    the slumbers of St. Agnes; with dimity curtains; field flowers in white vases,
                    good little devout prints on the walls; Timothy and Samuel, and the eternal
                    three choristers; Ary Schefferian photographs, and illuminated texts. Texts do
                    impress one so much more, don't they, when they are picked out in blue and
                    yellow, and are playing hide and seek amid numberless twirls and scrolls and
                    flourishes? Dolly is sitting at the dressingâtable brushing her hair, which,
                    black as night, thick as a mermaid's, waveless, rippleless, lies heavy on her
                    shoulders.</p>
                <p>I am sitting on the open window sill, and my small pale face looks out from
                    amongst a bush of curly warm tinted fuzz.<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7039-081"/> We
                    are enjoying a little sisterly chat at our <foreign xml:lang="fre">coucher</foreign>; it is about a week after our return home.</p>
                <p>âI wish,â says Dolly, brushing away with vigour, âthat people would sometimes
                    manage to get the right end of a story.â</p>
                <p>âHow do you mean?â I ask, a little absently.</p>
                <p>âOh, nothing particular,â she answers lightly, âonly Mrs. Smith has been giving
                    me rather a garbled version of yours and Hugh's adventure, which she says is all
                    over the country.â</p>
                <p>I frown. âWhat do I care?â</p>
                <p>âOf course not,â says my sister, smoothly combing out her long dusk locks, âonly
                    I don't think it is very pleasant to think of all the grooms in the
                    neighbourhood making merry over Sir Hugh's huggings and kissings and weepings
                    over you, that time you were insensible; are you sure you were quite insensible,
                    dear?â</p>
                <p>I toss my ruddy mane in a fury.</p>
                <p>âIf I wasn't may I be struck dead this<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7039-082"/> instant,
                    and be insensible for ever with a vengeance.â</p>
                <p>Dolly lays down her implements, and smiles good humouredly.</p>
                <p>âPoor little woodenâheaded Damon!â she says, âyou'll have to marry him after all,
                    Nell, to stop people's mouths, and prevent their spreading all manner of naughty
                    tales about you and him; what fun!â</p>
                <p>âHave to marry a man because I happened to be pitched out of a dogâcart with
                    him?â I say, with a snort, and a withering laugh. âHa! ha!â</p>
                <p>âNo, dear,â replies my elder, gravely twisting up her great black hair coils,
                    with warm dimpled hands; ânot because you were upset out of a dogâcart with
                    himâpeople <emph>will</emph> forget thatâbut because you spent twentyâfour hours
                    alone in a little roadâside publicâhouse with him, and because everybody knows
                    it, and will not forget it.â</p>
                <p>A moth floats in from the cool night, and frizzles himself to death in the
                    candle. I feel quite glad. I am in the sort of humour when one is pleased at
                        anything<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7039-083"/> bad happening to anything. Dolly,
                    good Dolly, drew her Bible to her, and looked out the evening lessons.</p>
                <p>âByâtheâbye,â she said, after a pause, âhave not you heard from Major M'Gregor
                    yet?â</p>
                <p>âNo. not yet,â I have to own, rather reluctantly.</p>
                <p>âRather odd, isn't it?â asks Dolly, carelessly.</p>
                <p>âNot the least odd,â I say sharply; but all the same, I do think, and for every
                    hour of the last four days have been thinking that it is odd, dreadfully odd;
                    âof course he would be busy when first he got back to his regiment; of course
                    he'd have a thousand things to do.â</p>
                <p>âWell, my dear, if you're pleased, I'm sure I am.â</p>
                <p>Dolly read her chapters piously all through, the dark long fringes shade the eyes
                    that travel so devoutly along the sacred lines; how peaceful and holy the fair
                    clear peach face looks. Why upon earth don't I go to bed, instead of sitting
                    swinging my small slippered feet, <choice>
                        <orig>illâtemâ</orig>
                        <reg>ill-temperedly</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7039-084"/> peredly, to and fro? How still the
                    great night outside is; the owls are snoring a little in the high elm tops, but
                    that is all. Dolly's Bible clasps close with a little click.</p>
                <p>âHow very ill papa's getting to look,â she says, looking up serene after her
                    devotions, with a face <q>
                        <l>âBright as for sins forgiven.â</l>
                    </q> âso much worse than before we went to Wentworth, even. Poor old gentleman!
                    it makes me quite low to look at him.â</p>
                <p>I bounce off the window sill, and walk hurriedly up and down, my long blue
                    dressingâgown floating behind me like a toga.</p>
                <p>âDid you say that only to frighten me, or because you really think it?â I ask
                    agitatedly.</p>
                <p>âBecause I really think it, of course,â replies she, gently; âis my sole <foreign xml:lang="fre">mÃ©tier</foreign> in life to lacerate your feelings?â</p>
                <p>âSeriously ill, do you mean, Dolly?â I ask very falteringly.</p>
                <p>Dolly rises and stands by the window;<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7039-085"/> how like a
                    tall garden lily she looks, in her long soft white draperies.</p>
                <p>âSo ill,â she says, emphatically, âthat unless some one leaves him a legacy, or
                    some piece of good luck happens to him, he'll be a dead man this time next year;
                    those bills, and his anxiety as to what is to become of usâof <emph>you</emph>,
                    I meanâafter his death, are knocking a great many nails into his coffin.â</p>
                <p>Life without the old man! That was the very first time that that awful, awful
                    thought presented itself to my mind.</p>
                <p>âDolly,â said I, with tremulous eagerness, grasping her arm, âwould it do him any
                    good, do you think, would it comfort him at all, if I were to tell him about
                    Dick?â</p>
                <p>âComfort him to know that you had found a man magnanimous enough, or selfish
                    enough, to be willing to starve with you, and effectually prevent your doing
                    anything towards raising the poor old family again, as it has been and is his
                    dearest wish that it should be raised,â said my sister, with trenchant
                        satire.<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7039-086"/> âYes, of course, it would comfort
                    him immensely, no doubt. I know nothing more calculated to inspire consolation;
                    good night, Nell.â</p>
                <p>Dolly sinks on her knees, and prepares to engage in evening prayer, and I slink
                    off to bed, and cry myself to sleep.</p>

                    morning. The troubles that had seemed so gigantic at 11 P.M., had contracted
                    themselves to very moderate dimensions at 7 A.M. From mountains they had become,
                    not indeed quite molehills, but very gentle elevations. Dolly had a way of
                    touching people on the raw; of course it was to her interest to make me believe
                    Dick unfaithful; and as to my father, why he <emph>did</emph> look rather ill
                    and droopy of late. I had been thinking so, myself, darling old thing! but then
                    the hot weather never suited him; it always made him flag, as it did the
                    flowers; when fresh winds came and cool cloudy skies, both<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7039-088"/> he and they would hold up their heads again, and
                    brighten.</p>
                <p>My code of morals, my system of rewards and punishments was very simple, the
                    story book code; later on in life we find that the human race's kicks and
                    halfâpence are not administered in strict accordance with the rules of that
                    code. The good boy gets cakes and ale; the naughty boy gets a whipping. There
                    seemed to me an antecedent improbability in the idea of such an enormous grief
                    being laid on the poor slight shoulders of a harmless girl, whose life, as far
                    as overt acts of wickedness were concerned, was a sheet of white paper. It
                    seemed like putting a camel's load on a fly's back. An enormous grief always
                    does seem improbable when it is the first of its family. Its brothers and
                    sisters excite less astonishment, though perhaps no less anguish.</p>
                <p>âI saw two magpies yesterday.â I say to myself, âthat is a good omen; my letter
                    will come toâday.â I am standing before my lookingâglass, sticking up<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7039-089"/> my deadâleaf cables, with long hair pins. I don't
                    look in the least the sort of woman that anything remarkable is likely to happen
                    to; a fair, soft, foolish woman made to say loving inanities to a husband, to
                    make socks for his children, and be utterly humâdrum and commonâplace and happy.
                    The loud whirâirâring of the gong comes sounding upstairs, deadened by the thick
                    oak doors; I run down in a hurry. My father is always up and out very early,
                    long before any of us; while the house is yet in the housemaid's possession. He
                    is out now, and I have to read prayers. I sit down with dignity in the old oak
                    armâchair, nearly black with age and varnish, and of the most uncompromising
                    straightness of backâwhat strong spines our ancestors must have been blessed
                    with, for apparently they never indulged in the luxury of leaningâopen the
                    ancient calfâbacked Bible, in which twentyâone and nineteen years ago
                    respectively, my father recorded the doubtful blessing of his daughters'
                    births.</p>
                <pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7039-090"/>
                <p>Opposite me, on a long bench, sit the servants, in clean caps and aprons, and
                    behind them open windows, and the sun, and the green trees, and the June airs at
                    play. It is a very long chapter; all about the Israelitish wars, how Joshua and
                    his host took Ai and the king thereof, and the people thereof, and killed them
                    all; and then went off to Libuah, and did the same there, and then on again
                    ditto. <emph>How</emph> tired they must have got of cutting and hacking those
                    poor Aborigines! About the middle of the bloody annals I look up, and take a
                    glance off through the window over the servants' heads, and see the old postman
                    with the swinging gait and the witheredâapple cheeks, shambling down the drive.
                    He is earlier than his wont. I lose my place and grope hopelessly for it with
                    eyes and fingers, for about five minutes. Having found it, I set off at a hard
                    gallop and race through Thursday morning, third week in Thornton's âFamily
                    Prayers,â skipping the âQueen, the Clergy, and the Children of this familyâ
                    altogether. I come to Amen, at<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7039-091"/> last; and before
                    the servants are off their knees, I am at the Hall door.</p>
                <p>The old postman has gone again; he is half way up to the gate by now; he knows
                    our manners and customs and has left the bag hanging on the bell. I tear it
                    open; the Times and a Pamphlet; halfâaâdozen blue envelopes in the usual sprawly
                    tradesmen's hands for Sir Adrian Lestrangeâpoor darling Sir Adrian, I wish I
                    might pitch them all at the back of the fireâa pink note, and two letters for
                    Miss Lestrange, and one letter for Miss Eleanor Lestrange.</p>
                <p>One letter, but alas! alas! not the right one! It is, as I find out later, when I
                    have patience to read it, from a sister of my mother's, an excellent â<foreign xml:lang="fre">mÃ¨re de famille</foreign>,â and its purport is chiefly to
                    tell me that dear Cecilia has had the nettleârash, and that dear Archie has
                    passed for the Line, and has come out 41st, and, indeed, no wonder, considering
                    the way in which he has been reading for the last three months. Now I throw it
                    down and stamp upon it.</p>
                <p>âWhat's the matter,â asks Dolly, <choice>

                    favour us with her company at our morning orisons.</p>
                <p>âEverything's the matter,â I say exhaustively, picking up my aunt's effusion, and
                    flinging it to the other end of the room.</p>
                <p>âNot got your letter yet?â</p>
                <p>âNo.â</p>
                <p>âDear me! how odd! are you sure it has not slipped inside that Magazine?â</p>
                <p>âHow <emph>could</emph> it?â I say gruffly.</p>
                <p>âPerhaps you forgot to give him your direction?â (How likely!)</p>
                <p>âNo, I didn't.â</p>
                <p>âPerhaps you did not write it clear enough?â</p>
                <p>âI wrote it as plain as a pikestaff!â</p>
                <p>âHm! perhaps he is ill?â</p>
                <p>âDon't say that!â I cry eagerly, turning pale, âI'd rather he'd have forgotten me
                    than that; no, I don't think that I would either; oh Dolly, Dolly, what can be
                    the matter?â I sink down on the bench and cover my eyes with my hand.</p>
                <p>âPerhaps it'll come toâmorrow?â says<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7039-093"/> Dolly;
                    turning away, and in a kinder voice than usual.</p>
                <p>âIt'll never come!â I say tempestuously, flinging down my head on my arms, on the
                    cold wooden table.</p>
                <p>âSh! Sh! don't make a scene! here's papa!â By a great effort I throw off my own
                    trouble, for the time; defer it to a more convenient season; I can always do
                    that for <emph>him</emph>, and then I go to the old man and put my arms about
                    him, and thank him for the flowers he has broughtâhe always brings me a little
                    pretty bunch, summer and winterâand kiss the old pale weary face so lovingly.
                    The dew and the moist night airs have lifted up the heads of the plants and
                    shrubs that drooped so yesterday, but I misdoubt me this old scathed tree will
                    never hold his head up again bravely, till the dear Lord transplants him to a
                    kindlier, warmer clime.</p>
                <p>âThis is the day of the Coxes' croquet party, isn't it?â says Dolly, as we sat at
                    breakfast, his â<emph>Fate Shompater</emph>,â as Mr. Coxe resolutely calls it;
                    âwe need not go<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7039-094"/> till about four I should think,
                    need we?â</p>
                <p>âI shall not go at all!â I say doggedly.</p>
                <p>âNonsense,â says Dolly, severely, âyou must go; you cannot treat people in that
                    way, accepting their invitations, and then never going near them, it's
                        <emph>too</emph> bearish!â</p>
                <p>âI don't want to go!â I say plaintively, turning towards my father, and
                    stretching out my hand to stroke his.</p>
                <p>âYou want to stay with the old man, do you, Nell? So you shall! So you shall!
                    there's plenty of people to go to the Coxes' fine party without you.â</p>
                <p>âJust as you please, of course,â says Dolly, very coldly; âchildren of nature are
                    not accountable beings, I suppose; poor Sir Hugh! I'd sooner meet a bear robbed
                    of her whelps, than him in the state he'll be in toâday!â</p>
                <p>I frown at her to stop, but the mischief is done.</p>
                <p>âIs Sir Hugh Lancaster to be there?â asks my father, lifting up his head.</p>
                <p>âYes, to be sure he is, he is coming all the way down from town, on purpose to
                    seeâAmaryllis Coxe.â</p>
                <pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7039-095"/>
                <p>We all held our tongues for a minute.</p>
                <p>âI think, Nell,â says my father, rising slowly to leave the room; âI think
                    perhaps, you had better go, they are civil people, and there's no use giving
                    offence.â</p>
                <p>âI suppose,â says Dolly, as we entered the Coxian Park gates that afternoon; âI
                    suppose, we shall finish up with a dance, for I heard Coxe <foreign xml:lang="fre">pÃ¨re</foreign>, telling Lady Capel that his daughters were
                    âso uncommonly fond of cutting capers, that if they could not have a 'op
                    anywhere else, they got up a kickâup at home.ââ</p>
                <p>As we drive up to the door, I see a faint pitying smile flitting over the
                    countenances of the butler and footmen as they glance at our equipage, but they
                    are too well drilled not to stifle it instantly. Mrs. Coxe receives us in the
                    white and gold drawingâroom; the gorgeous glare of which makes one's eves water
                    this bright day. Mr. Coxe tells us that âhe is 'appy to see us in
                        '<emph>is</emph> 'ouse,â and that âhe believes his young ladies are out in
                    the front, and would not we like to join them?â Ploughboys, <choice>

                    </q> alias, the Upper Ten Thousand, and the Coxes have âyoung gentlemen and
                    young ladies.â In Mr. Coxe's vocabulary, a room is an apartment, a house is a
                    mansion or a residence, and a wife is a lady or a partner. He does not mean to
                    be pompous in the least; he can no more help talking Manchester than a dog can
                    help barking. So we step out through the great plate glass windows, which are
                    thrown high up, out on a broad urned and statued terrace, and thence on to the
                    croquet ground, which is mown as short as a convict's hair, and where we find
                    Mr. Coxe's âyoung ladies and gentlemen,â as well as many other people's
                    disporting themselves.</p>
                <p>It is hardly saying too much to put croquet as an invention on a level with
                    gunpowder and printing; it certainly is more unmixedly beneficial to the human
                    race than either of the others. Who can be sufficiently loud in praise of a
                        common<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7039-097"/> standing ground, where man and woman
                    can meet without man being effeminate, or woman masculine. It requires a strong
                    effort of memory to realize the barren time when women struggled through their
                    long weary days, unassisted by those gracious twins, croquet and afternoon tea.
                    At the Coxe's croquet party, I need hardly say that there were a great many more
                    women than men. I never yet was at a croquet party where such was not the case,
                    for admirable pastime as it is, no man that <emph>is</emph> a man, and not a
                    curate, will ever be induced to put his hand to a mallet, unless he has
                    absolutely nothing else to do.</p>

                    nothing. So is Lady Lancaster; entertaining kindred frumps and foozles in Eaton

                <p>The Scots Greys are still to the fore, for âEngland expects every man to do his
                    duty,â and their duty is at present to guard the Cathedral Close and Minor
                    Canons of Nantford from invasion. Little De Laney is here too, much to his own
                    disgust. Instead of leaning his jolly little smooth face out of the modest
                    bowâwindow of his corps' club, he is dancing attendance on a moribund uncle for
                    whose gouty shoes he is lying in wait, the mercenary infant!</p>
                <p>âAmmy! Ammy! Amaryllis, my dear!â cries Mrs. Coxe, as we appear on the
                    sceneâAmaryllis is mistress of the ceremonies, and is flitting about in an
                    elaborate Parisian toilette, eminently suited for a Chiswick breakfast or a
                    Horticultural FÃªte, and looks as she mostly does, all nose and bustââhere are
                    the Miss Lestranges, my dear; I hope you can make up a set for them!â</p>
                <pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7039-099"/>
                <p>Amaryllis looks doubtful; there are five or six sets in full force already, and
                    how to provide the gentle stimulus of a man or two for each game, is the problem
                    which has been making her curse the day on which she was born for the last half
                    hour. What to do with our pauper population is a joke to it. All the parish
                    priests, and all the red coats, with whatever carefullest economy expended, have
                    been used up.</p>
                <p>âThere are Mortimer Spencer, and the two Miss Lestranges and myself, that's
                    four,â she says slowly; âbut that would be so dull for them; there's Sir Hugh
                    Lancaster and Mr. De Laney, but they won't play; my sisters asked them to join
                    their game some time ago, but they would not; they said they did not know
                    how.â</p>
                <p>âPerhaps,â Dolly suggests, with a suave little smile, âperhaps if you ask them
                    again, and make a great favour of it, they would not be so obdurate; people must
                    not be allowed to be lazy on an occasion like this.â Amaryllis shakes her head
                    and goes reluctant; two minutes<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7039-100"/> more, and she
                    returns in triumph, leading the two culprits. Hugh, as I am well aware, would be
                    most happy to play dolls, marbles, jack straws, anything were I to be his
                    assistant.</p>
                <p>âLittle birds that can sing and won't sing, must be made to sing,â says my sister
                    playfully, putting out a ready sisterly hand to Hugh, so âyour lordships have
                    condescended to yield to our importunities; we were meditating going on our
                    knees, if that were necessary.â</p>
                <p>âThe little birds are quite game for singing till they crack their little throats
                    if anybody'll show 'em how,â says De Laney, putting in his little oar. Hugh is
                    never strong at badinage, he has as heavy a hand at it, as a bad cook has with
                    onions. On the present occasion, I appear to have taken away his elderly breath,
                    for he is staring at me as a school boy at a mince pie, as a pig at acorns.
                    Really it is too bad of him, when he has been having the handsomest women in
                    England, in the becomingest dresses passing in review before him every day for
                    the last<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7039-101"/> week, that he should be gaping like a
                    bird in the pip at a simple country girl in a little straw hat.</p>
                <p>âWhat sides? what sides?â asks Amaryllis, âMorty, dear, put that hoop
                    straight.â</p>
                <p>I go up to Mr. De Laney, who is arranging a little delicate bouquet of heliotrope
                    and geranium in his button hole. âWill you be sure and play with me?â I say
                    eagerly.</p>
                <p>The young fellow looks slightly surprised.</p>
                <p>â<emph>I</emph>, of course I will; proudest moment of my existence; only I think
                    it fair to warn you that I never got through a hoop in my life.â</p>
                <p>âMiss Coxe,â I say, lifting up a trembling voice and blushing, âShall you and I
                    and Mr. De Laney play the other three?â</p>
                <p>âThat would not be fair,â puts in Dolly, with slight asperity in her tone; âyou
                    are such a good player; you have given us much the weakest side; you had better
                    let me take your place, that would make it nearly equal!â</p>
                <pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7039-102"/>
                <p>âI think,â says Amaryllis, coming to my rescue, âthat Miss Eleanor Lestrange's
                    arrangement is the best on the whole; Mortimer is much better than I am, and I
                    suppose that Sir Hugh and Mr. De Laney are about equal.â</p>
                <p>Dolly is too well mannered to oppose the fiat of the mistress of the ground, and
                    she bites her lip, and says smiling, âWell, ânever say dieâ must be our motto,
                    and Mr. Coxe won't scold us <emph>very</emph> much if we do get him into
                    disgrace, will he?â</p>
                <p>Mr. Coxe junior wears barnacles, and his complexion is spotted as the pard's; but
                    his heart is tender. Dolly never puts all her money on one horse; she has many
                    irons in the fire, and Mortimer Spencer De Lacy is her last and smallest
                    one.</p>
                <p>âBlue begins; Morty, give Miss Lestrange the blue.â</p>
                <p>I make an inward resolution that where my boy goeth, I will go; that the hoop or
                    the tunnel, or the bell that bids defiance to his inexperienced chocolate ball
                    shall do the same to my practised green; so<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7039-103"/>
                    that I may have an excuse for sticking close into his pocket; it is the first
                    time that the dear little fellow has ever been used as a chaperon, I fancy.</p>
                <p>âI did not think I should see you again,â I say, very friendlily, anxious to
                    engage in conversation, and edging up to where he stands, dishonestly trying to
                    kick his ball into position without being detected. âI thought you were going
                    back to Windsor.â</p>
                <p>âSo did I, but <foreign xml:lang="fre">l'homme</foreign> proposes, and <foreign xml:lang="fre">l'homme's</foreign> great uncle by marriage disposes.â</p>
                <p>âHow tiresome for you; have you got to stay long?â</p>
                <p>âOh, I suppose till the old party up there,â jerking his head in the direction of
                    his uncle's place, âtakes himself off to Abraham's bosom, which he does not seem
                    in any hurry to do at present.â</p>
                <p>âYou don't seem very sorry for the poor old gentleman,â I say, laughing rather
                    nervously and squinting out of the corner of my left eye, to discover the
                    whereabouts of my Sir John Suckling.</p>
                <pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7039-104"/>
                <p>âHow can he expect one to be sorry for him, when he takes to dying at such an
                    ungodly time? if he had put it off a month now, it would have suited me down to
                    the ground; there's never much doing in July.â</p>
                <p>âThat's the way somebody will be talking of you byâandâbye,â I say with a
                    smile.</p>
                <p>âNot a doubt of it, unless I give them the slip by being cut off in my youth and
                    beauty beforehand,â he says, with a grin at the thought of his own demise.</p>
                <p>The Coxian croquet ground is to other croquet grounds what the garden of Eden is
                    to other gardens; it is the realization of a croquet player's dream. Flat as a
                    billiard table, big as a race course, with a fountain plashing coolly into a
                    stone basin in the middle, and with lime trees round it. They are all in flower
                    now, and their yellowish, greenish, whitish blossoms make the air almost too
                    heavy. The women in their blue and green and white dresses look like big pretty
                    flowers starring the sunny grass.</p>
                <pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7039-105"/>
                <p>Further off, a very smart marquee spreads its flag to the windâof which,
                    byâtheâbye, there is uncommonly littleâthere, later on, we are to flourish the
                    festive heels. Mr. Coxe comes strutting out presently with his little fat hands
                    in his breeches pockets, and that face which would be of such eminent service to
                    him in a Jacquerie, or French Revolution, stamping him so unmistakeably as of
                    the people.</p>
                <p>âWell, Miss Lestrange, and how are we getting on? progressing eh? ha! ha!
                    progressing?â</p>
                <p>âNot progressing at all, I'm afraid, Mr. Coxe!â says Dolly smiling; âon the
                    contrary, retrograding, I think!â</p>
                <p>âI'm afraid you don't find my son a very efficient coadjutor,â continues Mr. Coxe
                    pompously, putting his hands under his coat tails, and standing with his legs
                    rather wide apart. Mr. Coxe will probably be among Lord â's next batch of
                    lords.</p>
                <p>â<emph>Quite</emph> wrong!â says Dolly, glancing up under her little wild
                    roseâwreathed shepherdess hat at the blushing Mortimer. Bagging Mortimer, is
                    like rook shooting,<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7039-106"/> Dolly thinks; the poorest
                    of all sport, but still it is sport. Then halfâaâdozen extraâsized footmen come
                    stalking along, bringing ices and Badminton on superb trays, and we stop
                    pounding one another for a few minutes, and by the aid of these refreshments
                    endeavour to bring ourselves down from boiling point. I see Sir Hugh pouring out
                    a tumbler of Badminton for himself; a nice cooling drink; I hope he'll take a
                    great deal of it. Soon we return to our game with renewed vigour.</p>
                <p>âSend her away over there! tight croquet; <emph>I</emph> should; she plays next.â
                    This is a most unnecessary piece of brutality, for I, with my Grenadier, am
                    struggling for the second hoop, far in the back ground, as I resolved at the
                    outset I would be.</p>
                <p>âWe stick together like leeches!â the boy said to me, just now, very innocently;
                    âDamon and what was the other f'la's nameâsomething beginning with a P. you
                    know.â My poor green goes spinning off under the limes, disturbing the bees, and
                    I, of course, have to go after it.</p>
                <p>âMy mother sent her love to you,â says<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7039-107"/> a too,
                        <emph>too</emph> well known voice at my elbow. Hugh is not like himself
                    toâday, somehow; he has not made a single joke, and he looks sheepish, and
                    tailâbetweenâtheâlegsâish. Being in love is sadly unbecoming to a man;
                    particularly to one who is not in the bloom of youth. Little Dresden shepherds
                    in pink coats and blue breeches look pretty when they are casting sheep's eyes
                    at little fat shepherdesses in powder, and red cheeks; but a real live man,
                    sunburnt, hirsute, broadclothed, looks ridiculous. Flight, without the most
                    flagrant incivility, is out of the question.</p>
                <p>âI'm sure I'm very much obliged to her.â</p>
                <p>âI only came down from town last night.â</p>
                <p>âOh!â</p>
                <p>âI came down on purpose for thisâwhat d'ye call itâthis croquet thing.â</p>
                <p>âOh!â</p>
                <p>âDo you suppose I came down to see the Coxes?â Hugh never pays much attention to
                    the requirements of Mrs.<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7039-108"/> Grundy; he is talking
                    now with much more earnestness than the subjects that mostly come up at a
                    croquet party, are calculated to engender.</p>
                <p>I look down very demurely, and make a little excavation in the smooth turf with
                    my mallet. âI don't know, I'm sure.â</p>
                <p>âCannot you guess who I came to see? you are sharp enough generally.â (He
                        <emph>must</emph> be in love to call me sharp; he might as well compliment
                    Dolly on her piety.)</p>
                <p>âI don't know, I'm sure!â I say very pettishly; for I perceive that we are the
                    objects of a good deal of amused notice, and I even detect my little naughty
                    soldier chuckling all to himself behind his pocketâhandkerchief.</p>
                <p>âI cannot bear being asked questions; will you move, please?â</p>
                <p>I give my ball a great vicious hit, which sends it flying back to the haunts of
                    men; and I fly after it, at the top of my speed. Hugh follows me, more surprised
                    than sorrowful; he <emph>cannot</emph> and <emph>will</emph> not understand. His
                    notions of courtship are like Samson's, who went down to Timnath,<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7039-109"/> and saw a woman that pleased him, and told his
                    parents so, and after that it was all plain sailing. Our game comes to an end at
                    last. Despite heroic efforts on the part of Amaryllis, our side is beaten. It
                    would have been very odd if it had not been; seeing that I had been riding a
                    donkey race, holding in my own jackass, and goading on my adversary's.</p>
                <p>âNow for the muffin worry,â says De Laney, as we stroll towards the house, having
                    thrown down our implements of warfare.</p>
                <p>âYes,â I say laughing; âwe are all being walked off to have clean bibs and
                    tuckers on!â</p>
                <p>The Muffin Worry is an Aldermanic feast; a dinner in all but the name. Everything
                    that a hundredâguinea cook, silver epergnes, gold plate, hotâhouse flowers,
                    grapes as big as plums, and pines as big as pumpkins could do was done, and yet
                    it all seemed to fall rather flat and dead somehow. Perhaps this was owing to
                    the large preponderance of the fair sex; half a score of women being obliged to
                        come<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7039-110"/> huddling in together. I am led into
                    the room, where first Dick looked away my foolish heart, by Major SomebodyâI did
                    not catch the nameâhe wears golosches and his brother officers always talk of
                    him as âshe.â On my other side is Violet Coxe. Illânatured <emph>he</emph>
                    friends have christened the three Miss Coxes âFree and Easy,â âFreer and
                    Easier,â âFreest and Easiest,â Violet is âFreest and Easiest.â Violet smokes
                    Regalias, and calls men by their surnames to their faces. Lily smokes
                    cigarettes, and Amaryllis does not smoke at all, because it makes her sick.
                    Image to yourself the neâplusâultra of vulgarity, fastness, and good nature, and
                    you have the gentle Violet.</p>
                <p>âI never asked you about your spill the other night,â she says, in her loud
                    voice; âI had other fish to fry; ha! ha! you pitched on your head, didn't you,
                    and kept flourishing your legs in the air, till Hugh Lancaster came and turned
                    you right way up again.</p>
                <p>âOh, hush! hush!â I say in an agony of fear lest she should be overheard.</p>
                <pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7039-111"/>
                <p>âWhy it was not your fault, though I did hear some cock and bull story the other
                    day, about the horses not having run away at all, and it's being all my
                    grandmother!â</p>
                <p>I flush crimson, and my eyes fill with tears.</p>
                <p>âHow cruel people are!â I say; âwhat a dreadful world it is!â</p>
                <p>âLor' my dear! he didn't mean to be cruel; he only thought you did it for a lark;
                        <emph>I'd</emph> have done it as soon as look.â</p>
                <p>âWho was it said so?â I asked indignantly.</p>
                <p>âPon my honour I forgetâoh yes, to be sure, it was that old rip LeroyâI remember
                    now, because M'Gregor pitched into him so, when he said it, gave it him right
                    and left.â</p>
                <p>My heart begins to beat wildly; I see the muslin of my dress agitated by its
                    quick hard pulsations; here is an opportunity for getting some news of him.</p>
                <p>âMr. M'Gregor has gone to Ireland, I believe,â I say faintly.</p>
                <pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7039-112"/>
                <p>âYes, poor old boy! he was as sick as a cat, I daresay, crossing; he's an awful
                    bad sailor; we all cried when he went, and Ammy took to her bed, goodness knows
                    why, for he never looked the same side of the room as her; good looking fellow
                    isn't he? I always say that those destroying angels ought not to be let walk
                    about loose, without tickets on their backs marked âdangerous.ââ</p>
                <p>âHe <emph>is</emph> handsome!â I say, turning away my head.</p>
                <p>âMorty heard from him this morning, I saw his handwriting; and what did I do but
                    open the letter and read every blessed word in itâwasn't Morty in a stew, oh no!
                    not at allâand he sent his love to us all; wasn't it nice of him?â (He is not
                    ill then; he can write to other people).</p>
                <p>The room swims round me for a minute, then I seize a glass of water, and drink
                    it.</p>
                <p>âWas heâwas heâpretty well?â I gasp.</p>
                <p>âOh, yes; he seemed very bobbish! he<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7039-113"/> said Cork
                    was very jolly quarters, and there were heaps of pretty girlsâgoodness me what's
                    the matter with you? why you are as white as the tableclothâare you going to
                        <emph>die</emph>?â</p>
                <p>I do not die, though I almost wish to. Oh cruel, beautiful King Olaf! are you
                    tired of me already? I knew that a poor stupid ignorant girl like me, was not a
                    fit mate for you!</p>
                <p>The long dull feast comes to an end, and the dancing begins in the marquee. There
                    is the same band that they had at Wentworth; clack clack go the bones, and the
                    fiddles squeak, and the everlasting weary tum te tum, tum te tum goes on
                    again.</p>
                <p>God knows I had not much inclination for dancing; but even tearing round and
                    round, with dragging feet, and a heart as heavy as lead, is better than the
                    inevitable alternative sitting out with Hugh. I have to dance with him of
                    course.</p>
                <p>âCome and take a turn outside,â he<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7039-114"/> says,
                    drawing me towards the scene of our late contest, where the limes' long shadows
                    have thrown themselves all along upon the dewy grass, like blackâstoled nuns in
                    prayer; and where the fountain is splashing and falling drip, drip, in silver
                    showers in the moonlight.</p>
                <p>âNo, no!â I say hastily, drawing back, âI don't want to; the grass is wet.â</p>
                <p>âYou did not seem to find it so just now, when you were sitting on those stone
                    steps with De Laney ever so long,â he says, rather affronted.</p>
                <p>âPlease don't tease!â I say with irritation.</p>
                <p>âBut there's something I want to say to you,â he urges pertinaciously, catching
                    my hand.</p>
                <p>âFor goodness sake, don't!â I say rudely; âI'm sure I should not like to hear
                    it.â</p>
                <p>As we drove home that night Dolly said,</p>
                <pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7039-115"/>
                <p>âDid Sir Hugh propose to you toâday, Nell?â</p>
                <p>âNo,â said I shortly, âand if he has a grain of sense he never will.â</p>

                <p><hi>I KEPT</hi> a journal in those days; if I wished I could tell you, oh my
                    friends, all I did, and a little of what I thought every day for the next six
                    months. But I think even the patientest among you would go to sleep, or at least
                    would yawn very widely, were I to test your powers of endurance with such an
                    infliction. On the contrary, oh kind unknowns! I will take a great leap in my
                    narration, a leap as big as Pedro Alvarado's; a leap from June to December; the
                    next picture in my little homely Hollandish series is a winter one.</p>
                <p>Oh, cruel six months! They have stolen so much from me, and they have given me
                    nothing in return. They found me very rich in hope and love, and pleasant<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7039-117"/> thoughts; they left me nearly bankrupt in
                    them all.</p>
                <p>I am standing by my bedâroom window, looking out listlessly. The white dimity
                    curtains look chilly and cheerless, and there comes in a draught that would turn
                    a mill under the illâfitting door; the mignonette in the green box is dead, and
                    the birds are silent. Outside also it looks very dreary. Winter has not come in
                    prettily this year, with his ermine cloak and his iceâdiamonds; he is an ugly
                    fellow enough; he has come in meekly, wetly, muggily; the meadows are all
                    sponge, and the roads all pomatum. A green Christmas, they say, makes a fat
                    churchâyard, and this Christmas is very green.</p>
                <p>Now and again great strong west winds sweep and riot over the land, not cold, but
                    noisy, blowy, blustery, crashing down great treeâlimbs, and making chimneyâpots
                    and tiles clatter down from house tops and church roofs. I turn away
                    disconsolately from the spectacle of nature's life in death, and look vacantly
                    in the glass.</p>
                <p>Can that be the same round, dimpled,<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7039-118"/> laughing
                    face that met me in that same mirror six short months ago; the curse of the
                    daughters of Zion seems to have fallen upon me; âburning instead of beauty.â
                    Hollow cheeks; the corners of the mouth drawn down, and the lines about it
                    puckered up, as if with continual weeping; dark deep shadows under the eyes, the
                    great wistful blue eyes that seem to see everything now mistily, dimly through
                    unshed tears; the hair twisted up with such negligent untidiness, as if nobody
                    cared or thought about it any longer; and the figure, the pretty, tall figure
                    drooping and nerveless.</p>
                <p>What is it has dimmed and marred my fair looks so? What evil thing have the
                    rolling hours brought me? What is the causeâwhat are the causes of the breaking
                    heart that looks out so wanly from that small young face? Shall I tell you?
                    First, then, and oh, far, far foremost, my father is very illâdying. God is
                    going to take away my dear old dad from me; the old man with whom I walked long
                    ago in the pleasant fields gathering <choice>
                        <orig>butâ</orig>
                        <reg>buttercups</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7039-119"/> tercups, in a white frock and a blue
                    sashâthe old man with whom I have had so many little jokes, and such loving
                    little tiffs, he who seems to be woven into the fabric of my very life. Warp and
                    woof must be parted now; the threads of his life be dissevered from mine, for He
                    who made has uttered His fiat of recall; He who gave is about to take away.</p>
                <p>When first this terrible thought came home icily to my heart (it was one night,
                    weeks ago, as I knelt at my evening prayersâthose prayers out of which one name
                    must so soon drop) I rebelled fiercely against it, pushed it violently from me,
                    it could not, would not beâit was too bad to happenâand my soul went up
                    agonizedly to the great God above me, in intercession for that dear old life, as
                    so many souls have gone up before me, but that prayer found no acceptance.</p>
                <p>In nightly vigils on my dark bed, I wrestled and strove with that grisly phantom;
                    I would stand in the breach between him and my old man; he should not come at
                    him, should not smite him with that<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7039-120"/> mighty
                    blade that lays the generations low; but to what purpose? He has put me aside,
                    he is drawing ever nigher, not stealthily, insidiously, but openly in the eye of
                    day, so that all may count his strides, and mark his coming.</p>
                <p>So my dear old father is going away from me on a long, long journey, and I don't
                    rightly know what I am to do without him. Is not this enough to make me sad? But
                    besides this greatest cause for woe, I have yet another sore grief, which, but
                    for the advent of the yet more unbearable one, would have seemed to me
                    unendurable; my lover has forsaken me. He on whose love I should have rested, he
                    on whose strong young heart I should have leaned in this bitter hour, has
                    forgotten me; not once in all these weary months has he written to me.</p>
                <p>How many days there are in six months, how many post times! Just so many times
                    have I had to undergo the pangs of a most grievous disappointment, a sharp smart
                    stab at first, then a long, dull, weary ache. And I had written to him, oh, so
                        often!<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7039-121"/> very joyfully and very lovingly
                    first; very anxiously and very lovingly next; then grievedly, bitterly, but
                    lovingly always, and at last I had ceased writing and had sunk into the dumbness
                    of despair.</p>
                <p>Dolly did not exult over me much; she reminded me, indeed, that she had warned me
                    against him, and opined that perhaps next time I should be more inclined to take
                    her advice, but on the whole she was goodnatured, and tried to comfort me on the
                    same grounds as would have afforded herself consolation in a like case, viz.,
                    his poverty and consequent undesirability; the vanity and nothingness of the
                    passion of love, and lastly, her invariable <foreign xml:lang="fre">corps de
                        rÃ©serve</foreign>âSir Hugh.</p>
                <p>And now, oh my friends, do not be very hard upon me; do not call me ugly names,
                    as fickle and heartless; do not sit in judgment upon me when I tell you that I
                    myself have of late been thinking much of this same Sir Hugh; not with more love
                    or less loathing than of yore, but as my possible, probable fate. I wanted to do
                    right, God knows! I thought it must be<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7039-122"/> right
                    to do this, because it was so hard, so difficult, so revolting. I see
                        <emph>now</emph> that I was wrong, but <emph>then</emph> my head was full of
                    Iphigenia and Jephtha's daughterâlike ideas.</p>
                <p>The doctor said that perfect exemption from all care and anxiety
                        <emph>might</emph>, probably would prolong my father's life for weeks, nay
                    months; and to win so dear, so inestimably precious a boon as his presence among
                    us, for even a few days longer than I otherwise should have it, I was willing to
                    sacrifice all my future years, willing to give my shrinking body to Sir Hugh's
                    arms, and my abhorring soul into his custody, though both body and soul clave
                    still with desperate ineradicable passion to that other.</p>
                <p>Since I drew my last lifeâpicture our affairs had become quite desperate; the
                    children of Israel had come down upon us like locusts; a dreadful man with a
                    hook nose, thick lips, and a greasy Hebrew face had come to take an inventory of
                    the furniture and movables. To spare our feelings and obviate the unpleasant
                    necessity of having a strange man quartered upon us,<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7039-123"/> our own manâservant had been turned into a bailiff
                    for the nonce.</p>
                <p>My father could not move outside his own pleasureâgrounds. âI suppose they will
                    let him pass by to his grave,â I thought bitterly. Bills and duns showered like
                    hail about our ears, and there we stood, helpless, defenceless, without hope or
                    refuge. An old dying man, and two poor young daughters in such a case. What
                    could be pitifuller? Mrs. Smith has just been telling me that âshe's mor'lly
                    certain there'll be a hexecootion in the 'ouse afore the week's hout; that there
                    will, drabbit 'em all!â</p>
                <p>An execution! Won't that put the finishing stroke to the work of decay and
                    sickness? Will that enfeebled frame ever be able to bear the rough world's jeers
                    at the yawning rifts and rents in the poor old family's sides; those rifts that
                    through so many tired years he has been painfully trying to draw a tattered
                    covering over. Will not the poor gray head be driven to take refuge before its
                    time in the restful grave? I clench my hands. I <emph>must</emph> do it; I
                        must.<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7039-124"/> My face looks back hard and rigid
                    from the glass at me; âI must, I must;â it seems to say too. As I stand thus in
                    an attitude worthy of Lady Macbeth, the door opens, and Dolly enters hurriedly,
                    without knocking.</p>
                <p>âSir Hugh's here,â she says rather hesitatingly; she does not quite know how I
                    shall take her bit of news; once or twice, lately, I have turned savage under
                    her exhortations and beseechments. I do not turn savage now; I say nothing, only
                    the rigid face in the glass grows rigider. My resolution is to be put to the
                    test soon indeed!</p>
                <p>Dolly's beauty is nowise dimmed by grief; sorrow has dug no ugly hollows in her
                    cheeks, nor dulled the sleepy splendour of her eyes. She looks a little pale and
                    anxious, but she manages somehow to do even that becomingly. Nor is her
                    appearance less <foreign xml:lang="fre">soignÃ©e</foreign> than it was; her dress
                    is simpler indeed than it used to be; as simple as it can be; but that only
                    serves to make her look younger, more innocently girlish. She wore now a thick
                    black serge<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7039-125"/> gown almost as plain as a
                    ridingâhabit.</p>
                <p>âIt will do so nicely for mourning with a little crape on it,â had been the
                    thought in Dolly's mind when she bought that dressâthe unexpressed thought, but
                    by some instinct, I had divined that she had so thought, and I hated her for
                    it.</p>
                <p>âFor God's sake, be civil to him!â she says now, coming up and laying an eager
                    hand on my shoulder, âhe is our only hope!â</p>
                <p>âI know it,â I say coldly.</p>
                <p>âFor pity's sake don't snub him! be good to him! do think of somebody beside
                    yourself for once.â (Dolly, of all people, to give that advice.)</p>
                <p>âI don't mean to snub him; I mean to be civil to him; I have made up my mind,â I
                    say resolutely, with that dull pain tightening round my heart.</p>
                <p>âMade up your mind to <emph>marry</emph> him! You don't mean it?â cries my sister
                    joyfully, while the prettiest carmine wave ripples into her soft cheeks.
                        â<foreign xml:lang="fre">Bon Dieu</foreign>! how thankful I am!â</p>
                <p>âDon't!â I say harshly, pushing her<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7039-126"/> away; her
                    mirth grated horribly somehow on my tense nerves.</p>
                <p>âDo make yourself a little bit tidy before you go to him,â she says, untying the
                    blue ribbon that binds her own inky hair waves, and preparing to insinuate it
                    among my curly wig. But I resist.</p>
                <p>âNo,â I say doggedly, âleave me alone; I won't be made up for sale; if he chooses
                    to bid for this piece of goods, he shall see all the flaws in it. I don't want
                    to cheat him in his bargain.â So I went, limp and crumpled to meet my fate.
                    Before I had given my resolution time to cool, I found myself in the library
                    facing my <foreign xml:lang="fre">futur</foreign>.</p>
                <p>He was standing with his back to the fire, whistling softly to himself. Evidently
                    he had called in on his way back from hunting; he had on a very shabby stained
                    old red coat, and very splashed spattered breeches and tops, but somehow he did
                    not look at all a bad fellow, nor an illâlooking one either. When he saw me, he
                    stopped whistling, and dropped his coat tails.</p>
                <p>âWell, how is he toâday? not worse,<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7039-127"/> I hope?â he
                    says it very heartily; there is a true ring in his deep voice, as if he really
                    meant it.</p>
                <p>âNo, not worse. I think much the same, thanks!â</p>
                <p>I sit down in my limpness on the sofa, and feel as if I were going to have a leg
                    or an arm cut off, and as if Hugh was the operator, and I wish he would make
                    haste and begin. Oh, if I could but take a whiff of chloroform, and awake to
                    find the limb amputated, the process over, the wooing accomplished. The fire
                    glows ruddy in the wide old chimney; the flames go curling, spiring, quivering
                    upwards. I gaze at the steel dogs in the hearth, and await the operation.</p>
                <p>âYou've grown very thin since last I was here.â That is how it begins. The
                    surgeon is taking off his coat, and rolling up his shirt sleeves.</p>
                <p>âVery likely,â I say, bitterly. âLying awake at night, and having worries, and
                    being miserable, does not conduce to putting flesh on one's bones!â</p>
                <p>âI wish to Heaven I could take half<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7039-128"/> your
                    worries for you; God knows I would if I could; will you let me try?â The kind
                    honest tones, and the kind simple words upset me quite; I am easily upset
                    nowâaâdays. I pull out my pocketâhandkerchief; my face undergoes the odd, droll
                    ugly contortions and workings of a person about to cry, and I burst into bitter
                    tears. My nose reddens, and my eyelids get pink, and I sit rocking to and fro,
                    and feeling a very desolate little girl indeed.</p>
                <p>âWon't you let me go halves in all your troubles, dear?â he asks, very
                    gently.</p>
                <p>He has come and stood close before me in his eagerness, and intercepts my view of
                    the steel dogs. I look up through my tears straight at him. I am relieved that
                    we are getting to business so soon.</p>
                <p>âDo you mean that you want me to marry you?â I ask, bluntly.</p>
                <p>âYes, I do,â he says, simply; âyou know I do; you know how long I have been
                    wishing and longing for it.â</p>
                <p>There is a little pauseâa little minute, when my thoughts go back miserably to<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7039-129"/> that curled Greek head, to those dark,
                    passionate, gray eyes that looked so true and were so false; then I say very
                    slowly and with infinite difficultyâ</p>
                <p>âI willâdo as you wish, ifâifâyou willâlend meâgive meâsome moneyâ<emph>a great
                        deal</emph>; oh dearâoh dear!â</p>
                <p>My sobs burst out fresh, I feel so degraded in my own eyes. He did not ask me
                    what I wanted money forâno doubt he divined; only the jollity died out of his
                    honest face, and a pained look took its place.</p>
                <p>âOf course you know,â he said, very heartily, âI hope I need not tell you
                    thatâthat you are welcome, most welcome to every farthing I possess, to make
                    ducks and drakes of, if you like; butâbut I don't want you to marry me for
                    that.â</p>
                <p>âIf I take money from you I must marry you,â I said, calmly. âI could not do it
                    else.â</p>
                <p>It seemed to me the most matterâofâfact piece of barter in the world; so much
                    young flesh and blood for so much current coin of the realm.</p>
                <pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7039-130"/>
                <p>âWhy, won't you try and like me?â he says, passionately. It seems hard to him
                    that his house, and his lands, and his dirty money should count for more with me
                    than his loving heart, and his tender, faithful eyes; and as he speaks he throws
                    himself on the sofa beside me.</p>
                <p>âI will try and like you,â I say, conquering myself, setting my teeth, and
                    vanquishing my intense desire to say something very rude, and rush away from
                    him; but even as I speak I shudder at his proximity.</p>
                <p>âWe might be so happy;â he says, rather plaintively. âI am not a very hard fellow
                    to live with, I don't think; I've never had a word with mother all these twenty
                    years, and you'd be easier to get on with, I fancy, than she is, poor old
                    lady!â</p>
                <p>âWe <emph>will</emph> try and be happy,â I say, firmly, and I give him my
                    hand.</p>
                <p>The operation is nearly over now, and I am alive after it. Then I am gathered to
                    the middleâaged heart, to the stained<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7039-131"/> red
                    coat, and the gray knitted waistcoat, and kissed, and thanked, and blessed, and
                    adjectived. I tear myself away at last, and escape to my room, where I fling
                    myself on my bed, and scrub my desecrated countenance, and wail, âOh, Dick,
                    Dickâoh, my love, my love!â to the unresponsive pillow.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                <p><hi>SIR HUGH</hi> must have abandoned the pursuit of the wily fox at an early
                    hour on that memorable afternoon, seeing that it was but halfâpast two, when,
                    the deed being done, he rode off on his long raking bay mareârode off to go and
                    tell his mamma of his prowess, and of what a lovely, willing bride he had
                    achieved. Only halfâpast two; there was therefore ample time for my father and
                    me to take our daily stroll; that stroll which we still took, though it had
                    become such a woeful piteous shadow of what it used to be. No earthly persuasion
                    could induce my father to give in to being an invalid, to stay in bed and have a
                    doctor. Every day he <emph>would</emph> get up and dress; <emph>would</emph>
                    come down<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7039-133"/> stairs, and sit in the library;
                    would sit in his usual chair, and read his usual books; but every day the
                    dressing and the coming down stairs took longer; every day the wheels of the
                    chariot drove more heavily; every day the silver cord loosenedâloosened; every
                    day the frail vessel of that dear life drifted ever fasterâfaster out, into the
                    great desolate homeless sea of Death. As well as any one could tell him, he knew
                    that he was dyingâknew that the few last sands of his hour glass were dribbling
                    slowly out; no need to break the news to him. To âbreakâ implies that the news
                    is bad; but to him this was not ill news; to him it seemed an evangelââgood
                    tidings of great joy.â But though he so well knew that solenmest factâperhaps
                    the more so because he did so know itâhe seemed now to taste a deeper, tenderer
                    joy than ever, even of yore, in Nature's sweet presence; even in her leafless
                    trees, her riotous western breezes, and her chill December suns.</p>
                <p>And thus it came to pass that we two who were so close to each other now;<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7039-134"/> we, who, a month hence, should be severed far
                    as time is parted from eternity, walked out together every day, gravely and
                    lovingly.</p>
                <p>At first our walk comprised pleasure ground, farmâyard, and home wood; but then,
                    after a little, we had to drop the wood, had to say a long goodâbye to itâto the
                    pleasant wood with its oaks, and its tangled briars, and its crimson dogwoodâfor
                    it lay on a rising ground, and taxed too hardly the poor struggling, difficult
                    breath.</p>
                <p>A week more, and the farmâyard is abandoned for a like cause. Every day the walk
                    grows shorter, the steps slower, the end nearer! God! What torture can be
                    comparable to that of standing, with one dearer to us than life, on the edge of
                    that awfulest, blackest gulf, seeing him slipping, slipping down into it, unable
                    to stretch out a finger to prevent him; to help him back again up the kindly
                    hither bank.</p>
                <p>On the afternoon of my betrothal, we were as usual creeping with tedious<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7039-135"/> lagging steps along the gravel walk, round
                    the flowerless flowerâbeds, stopping every ten paces to take breath. My father
                    was wrapped up in his old greatâcoat, (ah me, how he used to eschew great coats
                    in bygone days!) and I, with my arm passed through his, am trying to help on his
                    tottering steps, without his finding out that he is so helped.</p>
                <p>âI think you seem to be walking a little better toâday, dearest old man!â I
                    say.</p>
                <p>âAm I, Nell? I'm not a very grand traveller, I don't think.â</p>
                <p>We stop, and look over the wire fence at the drenchedâlooking grass, at the rich,
                    wet, loamy earth.</p>
                <p>âIf this mild weather lasts, we shall be seeing the crocuses out in flower here,
                    in another month,â I say.</p>
                <p>âI shall never see the crocuses again!â says my father, simply.</p>
                <p>A rush of tears blinds me, and through them I look up at the yellowing sunken
                    faceâthe face that is so immeasurably<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7039-136"/> more to
                    me than all the world besides,âmore, ten thousand times, than even my beautiful
                    false loverâand I <emph>know</emph> that he speaks truth; that I shall be
                    looking at the crocuses' golden blaze <emph>alone</emph>. In a few minutes I
                    swallow back my tears; I have all the rest of my lifeâtime to weep in, but they
                    must not come now; not now! not now! I say, gently pressing the dear arm that
                    leans so feebly on mine.</p>
                <p>âYou must not say melancholy things toâday, darling old daddy, for I have got
                    such a nice piece of news for you!â</p>
                <p>âNews! have you, Nell?â says he cheerfully. âWhy, little lass, you're getting
                    like the Athenians, that spent their time in nothing else but either to hear or
                    to tell some new thing.â</p>
                <p>Some spirits can jest and joke even on the verge of that gulf that swallows time
                    and space, nor with any irreverence towards the Great Presence, in whose
                    antechamber they stand waiting <q>
                        <l>âLike infants, sporting by the roar</l>
                        <l>Of the Everlasting Deep,â</l>
                    </q></p>
                <pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7039-137"/>
                <p>Such was my father.</p>
                <p>âThis is a real bit of news,â I say, smiling; âgood news too,â I add, though the
                    words go nigh to choke me. We are walking on again slowly, beneath the great ash
                    trees that spread black skeleton arms to the low dun sky.</p>
                <p>âGood news has forgotten the road here, I think, Nell, for this long and many a
                    day,â says my father, with a weary sigh. I look down and fumble with the lowest
                    button of my jacket.</p>
                <p>âSir Hugh Lancaster has been here again toâday,â I say, in a coy, low voice. My
                    father stops suddenly, and leans both hands on the top of his stick.</p>
                <p>âHas he?â he says, eagerly; âis your news about him, Nell!â</p>
                <p>I blush.</p>
                <p>âYes, he asked me to marry him; or I'm not sure that it was not I that asked him
                    to marry me,â I say, with rather dreary merriment; âanyhow, we settled it
                    between us: it <emph>is</emph> to be!â</p>
                <p>âThank God!â says my father, very reverently, under his breath; âthen<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7039-138"/> there'll be somebody to take care of my little lass
                    when I'm gone!â</p>
                <p>âIs it good news, dad? did I say true!â I ask, throwing a pair of loving young
                    arms about his neck, and laughing hysterically.</p>
                <p>âThat it is!â he says, heartily, and the strength seems to have come back into
                    his voice. âI can say, âNunc dimittis,â with all my heart <emph>now</emph>,
                    Nell; I could not have departed quite in peace before, when I thought of leaving
                    my little Nell to be a poor little illâused governess; but now,â he said, with a
                    dash of his old pride, âshe'll be able to hold up her head among the best in the
                    county, as she ought, God bless her!â</p>
                <p>âWhat good will it do me to hold up my head as high as Haman's, if you're not by
                    to see it and be glad of it?â I ask, desolately. Long dreary years, forty,
                    fifty, sixty perhaps, flash before my mind's eye, years of a bondage whose full
                    horrors my innocent young soul but vaguely takes in; years <emph>with</emph>
                    Hugh, and <emph>without</emph> papa.</p>
                <pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7039-139"/>
                <p>Oh, why could not I die of consumption, like that girl I took the jelly to
                    yesterday? Why could not I cough myself out of the world, as she was doing so
                    fast? âOn the âth instant, at Lestrange Hall, Eleanor, younger daughter of Sir
                    Adrian Lestrange, of rapid decline, aged nineteen.â And Dick would see it in the
                        <bibl><title>Times</title></bibl>, and be compunctious, and his grand deep eyes would fill
                    with remorseful tears, and he would rush away to the warsâthose vague wars of
                    which I always had so convenient a stock in my mental <foreign xml:lang="fre">repertoire</foreign>âand die, covered with wounds, and kissing my
                    photograph.</p>
                <p>This was the gloomy form my castleâbuilding took now; a picturesque death was the
                    only thing I seemed to have strength to long for.</p>
                <p>âNell,â says my father, breaking in upon a paragraph descriptive of Dick's
                    glorious demise, in <q>
                        <l>âWild Mahratta battle,â</l>
                    </q> that I was composing, âDo you remember my reading âKing Learâ to you
                    once?â</p>
                <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7039-140"/>
                <p>âYes,â I reply, wondering a little, âlong ago; and you used to call me your
                    little Cordelia; I remember,â</p>
                <p>âWell, darling,â he says, with a pensive little smile, âdo you remember what Kent
                    says when the poor old King is deadâ <q>
                        <l>âHe hates him that would on the rack of this tough world</l>
                        <l>Stretch him out longer.ââ</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>âOh, dad! dad!â I cry in the bitterness of my soul, clinging about him. âWhy
                    cannot you take me with you? Oh, we have been such friends, haven't we? Oh,
                    you're not going to leave me behind!â</p>
                <p>âHush, hush!â says he, soothingly, patting my hot wet cheek. âWhat will the fine
                    new lover say if we let you wash all the colour out of your eyes with crying;
                    God knows best, Nell! God knows best! we must try and think that!â</p>
                <p>âI cannot think it,â I say, desperately, âand I won't; I don't believe it.â</p>
                <p>After that we walk along in silence to the hallâdoor; I saying over and over to
                    myself, in utter heart sickness, âHe doesn't know best! He doesn't! He<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7039-141"/> doesn't!â and dashing myself like a little
                    foolish useless wave against the great adamant rock of the Omnipotent Will.</p>

                    never would let us be so very, very desolately wretched.â Sometimes we feel<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7039-143"/> that we must curse God and die; it would be
                    such a relief to us; curse God, as Job's wife is supposed to have urged her much

                <p>Sometimes we say to ourselves that surely some malevolent tricksy demon must have
                    the world's government reins in his fiend handsâsome demon that delights in
                    thwarting our poor little plans, in inventing new and ingenious diseases to rack
                    our poor patient bodies. Our very wishing anything seems to drive the object
                    wished for farther away; our very dreading anything seems to draw the dreaded
                    object magnetically nearer. In every newspaper we take up, we see âmelancholy
                    suicides,â âhorrible murders,â âfatal accidents,â âeconomic funeral companies;â
                    and often we lay it down with a dull numb feeling that the<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7039-144"/> world is all out of joint; all discord and jangling
                    dissonance.</p>
                <p>But there is a Book, a simple, oldâfashioned eloquent Book, that tells us that
                    âthe fashion of this world passeth away,â the fashionâthe old, old fashion that
                    we are all so weary ofâthe fashion of being wicked, and being sick and
                    disappointed and heart sore; and whoso believeth that it is so passing, straight
                    way there is to him harmony and peace and order. Never through all the
                    monotonous selfârepeating centuries, during which this old globe has gone
                    lumbering round the sun, has there been an instance of instinct misleading any
                    of the creatures in which it has been planted; and as surely as some inner voice
                    whispers to the swallows, telling them then it is time for them to come flying
                    over the foamy green seas to the English spring trees and fresh fields, so
                    surely does some higher instinct, proportioned to our higher, nobler nature, bid
                    us plume our wings for a flight, when life's winter is over, to some distant
                    spring land, where great melody and sweet health<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7039-145"/> and content are waiting for us; some land where âall crooked things shall be
                    made straight, and all rough places be made smooth.â But great sorrows are in
                    their nature like mountains, closing in the horizon, preventing our catching a
                    glimpse of any of the fields, where <q>
                        <l>âYou scarce can see the grass for flowers,â</l>
                    </q> of the summer waves tumbling and joyfully tossing up red seaâtang on
                    sunâlit yellow sands, of feathery larch woods, and blue rushing brooks, that
                    there may be, that we know are, beyond them.</p>
                <p>I seemed now in my complete lifeâhatred and bitterness to be prisoned in some
                    narrow black valleyâsome deep gulley between great frowning granite peaks. I
                    could not climb up their smooth slant sides, to see the sunrise washing the low
                    morning clouds, and the gray morning billows with his flamy streams. I was
                    groping with hands stretched out before me blindly, among the boulders and the
                    pitâfalls, and the sullen black pools in the valley bottom; and I must stay
                        groping<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7039-146"/> there as I felt, till the oil of
                    my life's lamp were burned out, till I sat down and died there amid the darkness
                    and the doleful beasts and the murky stagnant waters.</p>
                <p>âIf,â thought I, âI had been an old rouÃ© of seventy, who had dedicated all my
                    three score and ten years to the debasing of soul and body, I could hardly have
                    incurred more woful penalties than my nineteen summers of insipid innocence had
                    drawn upon my devoted head.â Not even the consciousness of having made a
                    sacrifice that raised me (at least in my own estimation) to a level with the
                    Jewish maiden I have before alluded to; not even the consciousness of having
                    been âhigh heroicalâ supported me much. I did not grudge the sacrifice I had
                    made; if it had to be done over again, I should do it over again; but I thought
                    myself entitled to make as many wry faces over it as I felt inclined, and their
                    name was legion.</p>
                <p>One day, Dolly entering, catâlike, in her long, straight serge gown, found me<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7039-147"/> grovellingâlying all along on the floor,
                    prone, while tears rushed in rivers from my foolish blue eyes, and laid the dust
                    on the carpet.</p>
                <p>âAre you dead, Nell?â she asks quietly, holding the door in her hand; âbecause if
                    so, I'll send for the coroner.â</p>
                <p>âNo,â say I, blubbering noisily, and burrowing still farther into the dim blue
                    squares of the old Kidderminster. âWorse luckâI wish to God I was.â</p>
                <p>âAre your bowels yearning still over the big wax doll?â she asks, jeeringly.
                    âHave you retired into your chamber to weep there?â</p>
                <p>âYes,â I say, angrily, lifting up my head, and pushing back my wet, fuzzy locks;
                    âand since it is <emph>my</emph> chamber, and not yoursââ</p>
                <p>âYou'd thank me to âabsquatulate,â as the Yankees say,â interrupts she, laughing
                    and showing the sweetest, shortest, whitest little set of teeth that ever set
                    dentist at defiance. âWell, I will in a minute; but âI have an errand unto thee,
                    oh, captain.ââ</p>
                <pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7039-148"/>
                <p>âI wish your errand was to tell me that I was going to be hanged, or that you
                    were; I'm sure I don't know which would give me the most gratification,â growl
                    I, squatting still Jobâlike in the ashes.</p>
                <p>âYou're a little fool, my sweet Nell,â says my sister, playfully. âI don't
                    believe you'd relish a bit of whipcord round your little neck any more than I
                    should; but really,â she went on, gravely, âI wonder you have not more spirit
                    than to be booâhooing about that scoundrelly longlegs; if any man had served me
                    such a turn,â she said, clenching her right hand into a small white ball, while
                    her sleepy eyes woke up into beautiful fierce life, âI might have killed him,
                    put a pinch of strychnine into his tea, or stabbed him in the back on the
                    slyâindeed, I'm sure I should; but cry over him, put my finger in my mouth and
                    pipe my eye, never, never, never!â (a <foreign xml:lang="ita">crescendo scale,
                        ending in <foreign xml:lang="ita">fortissimo</foreign>).</foreign></p>
                <p>âIf you talk of meanness,â I cry, springing to my feet and stamping, âI wonder
                    what can be meaner than selling yourself like a bale of goods or a barrel of
                    beer, as<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7039-149"/> I'm doing. Oh, what do I care how
                    mean I am! What sin is there so big that I would not commit it this minute, and
                    commit it most gladly too, if I could but have him back here this minute in this
                    room. Oh, he has not forgotten me! I know it! I know it! There's some mistake,
                    I'm sure, and I shall find it out when it's too lateâwhen I'm in hell!â</p>
                <p>I fling myself down again, and cry aloud; my punishment seems greater than I can
                    bear. Dolly walks to the window and looks out.</p>
                <p>âOh, Dick, Dick!â I groan, âwhere are you? where are you? Oh, my darling, are you
                    dead? Oh, come back to me, for God's sake!â</p>
                <p>I forget even Dolly's sneering presence, I forget my father, forget everything
                    but that one man that made earth first heavenâthen hell for me!</p>
                <p>Dolly goes to the washâhandâstand and pours some cold water into a basin.</p>
                <p>âStop, crying,â she says, harshly; âyou have made your bed, and you must lie on
                    it. Sir Hugh is here againâof course he<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7039-150"/> has a
                    right to come now; and you'd better try and bathe the swelling and redness out
                    of your eyes, if we are to get any money out of him. You don't look a choice
                    morsel to bribe any man with as you are now.â</p>
                <p>Her cold voice calls me back to myself. I rise and pick up my heavy cross, and
                    prepare to stagger along a little farther under it. I sponged and mopped my
                    face, and scrubbed it with a Turkish towel, and then I looked in the glass; and
                    then I mopped and scrubbed again, and tried to persuade myself that I did not
                    look as if I had been crying.</p>
                <p>Half an hour after I am sitting on the green settee by the library fire, with the
                    gentleman by whose library fire I am to sit through my life, with what patience
                    I may.</p>
                <p>His arm is round my waist, and he is brushing my eyes and cheeks and brow with
                    his somewhat bristly moustache as often as he feels inclinedâfor am I not his
                    property? Has not he every right to kiss my face off if he chooses, to clasp me
                    and hold me, and drag me about in whatever manner he wills, for has not he
                    bought me?<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7039-151"/> For a pair of firstâclass blue eyes
                    warranted fast colour, for ditto superfine red lips, for so many pounds of prime
                    white flesh, he has paid down a handsome price on the nail, without any
                    haggling, and now if he may not test the worth of his purchases, poor man, he
                        <emph>is</emph> hardly used! As for me, I sit tolerably still, and am not
                    yet actually sick, and that is about all that can be said of me. Presently the
                    situation becomes too warm for me.</p>
                <p>âMay I move a little, please?â I say, edging away out of my owner's arms. âI'm
                    ratherârather hot, pleaseâthe fire, I mean.â</p>
                <p>âAll right,â says he, cheerily; âit <emph>is</emph> a fire to roast an ox, isn't
                    it? let's move the settee back a bit, and then we shall be all sereneâshan't we,
                    love?â</p>
                <p>So we move the settee back into the shade, where the fire glow cannot reach us,
                    but my blood does not grow any the cooler, for that accursed, girdling arm is
                    still round meâmy buyer's armâthat arm that seems to be burning into my flesh
                    like a brand.</p>
                <pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7039-152"/>
                <p>âJolly this, isn't it?â whispers Strephon, chuckling; âand it'll be jollier still
                    when we're married; it'll be <emph>always</emph> like this then.â</p>
                <p><emph>When we're married!</emph> Merciful Heavens! If the prologue is so
                    terrible, <emph>what will the play be?</emph></p>
                <p>âIf you please,â I begin again meekly; âIâI think I'd rather sit on a chair by
                    myself; youâyouâhurt me rather.â</p>
                <p>I remove myself, unopposed, to a distant chair, and breathe freer.</p>
                <p>âI thought you promised you'd try and like me, Nell,â says Hugh, rather ruefully,
                    byâandâby.</p>
                <p>âI <emph>will</emph> try, I will indeed,â I cry eagerly, clasping my hands,
                    âonlyâoh do, <emph>do</emph> give me time!â</p>
                <p>âGive you time, indeed,â says Strephon, grimly, glancing at his own
                    weatherâbeaten face in the glass; âall very fine, but I have not so much time to
                    give; by the time you have made up your mind whether you like me or not, I shall
                    be a drivelling old fool, past caring for any woman's liking.â</p>
                <pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7039-153"/>
                <p>I answered him to never a word, I agreed with him so fully as to his great
                    age.</p>
                <p>âOne would think,â pursues he, stalking up and down in a fume, âto hear you talk,
                    that I had a humpback, or a club foot, or some great natural deformity;â and
                    then he steps before me, and says with a certain rough pathos in his voice,
                    âWon't you tell me, Nell, what there is about me so repugnant to you, that I may
                    try and mend it?â</p>
                <p>A terror seizes me; beaked Israelitish faces swarm before my mind's eye; am I
                    recklessly tossing away salvation in the shape of those signed cheques on
                    Coutts' Bank, that are lying in simple beauty on the table.</p>
                <p>âDon't talk nonsense,â I cry pettishly, giving my head a little illâhumoured
                    jerk; âwhen did I say there was anything about you repugnant to me? Cannot you
                    understand that it is not so easy to get very fond of a person all in a minute,
                    when you have not been thinking of anything of the kind before; I told you I'd
                    try and like you, and I will: what more can I say? Oh<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7039-154"/> please, <emph>please</emph> have patience with me!â I
                    cried, piteously.</p>
                <p>âHaven't I been patient already?â he asks, sorrowfully. âI'm not an impatient
                    fellow ever; it isn't my nature. I don't expect to sow and reap the same day,
                    but I don't know how it is, you seem to like me less and less every time I
                    come.â</p>
                <p>No answer: a guilty head hangs down low, lower, till it droops on a guilty
                    breast.</p>
                <p>âIf,â says Hugh, quite gently, though his honest face is working a little, as
                    with some strong smothered emotion, âyou feel that you can never have anything
                    but a bare toleration of me, say so at once, child? I'm old enough and strong
                    enough to bear a little disappointment; we can't expect to have everything our
                    own way in this world, and I know I'm not quite the right cut to take a girl's
                    fancy; it would be better you should speak out, while it's time, than that we
                    should make each other miserable for all our lives.â</p>
                <p>I gaze long and earnestly into the fire, before I answer; watch the little

                    and wrench and generally maltreat each other. Shall I take him at his word? Oh
                    God! how delicious it would be; it would be like exchanging the fetid stifling
                    air of an eastern dungeon for the free gales rioting under the blue April
                    heavens.</p>
                <p>Shall I get off the altar, where, (<foreign xml:lang="fre">Ã la</foreign>
                    Jephtha's daughter, I am lying bound; slip the cords off my wrists, and walk
                    lightly away? Shall I still be able to think of that laughing <foreign xml:lang="fre">debonair</foreign> glorious face, without stabs of despairâof
                    those strong arms where I may yet find heaven, without deadly sin? Shall I defy
                    the might of Israel? Shall I let the âhexecootionâ have its way? Shall I kill my
                    old dad? <emph>Never</emph>. For him I have begun this great sacrifice; for him
                    I will complete it; for him I will go to hell. So I speak quite firmly, even
                    though I feel myself paling to the lipsâSir Hugh's lips.</p>
                <p>âNo, I have said it, and I mean to stick to it; let us try and make the best of
                    one another; it's a very puzzling world, and it's<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7039-156"/> very hard to know how to live through it; but I
                    suppose if we try to do our best, it'll all come right in the end.â</p>
                <p>So I, in my despair.</p>
                <p>Then he says, with some difficulty, and flushing scarlet, despite his nine
                    lustresâ</p>

                <p>I interrupt him, hastily.</p>
                <p>âNonsense,â I cry, âsay no more about it; I mean to be your wife, and I suppose
                    we shall manage to scratch on pretty much as other people do.â But to my own
                    heart I say that âI would that I were dead.â</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                <p><hi>THERE</hi> is a great sacrifice to the fore; a hecatomb offered at the altar
                    of filial affection; a pretty white lamb is being led out, beâfigged,
                    beâribboned, beâfilleted to the slaughter. Pipe and tabor go tooâtooing before
                    her, and the butcher, with his sharp knife gleaming, walks behind her. But the
                    lamb knows that she is going to the sacrifice, and she bleats very
                    piteously.</p>
                <p>Now for the key to this graceful metaphor. I am the lamb, Hugh is the butcher,
                    Dolly is the pipe and tabor, and the slaughter is our nuptials. I had looked
                    upon our marriage as a distant possible evil, huge and horrible indeed, but
                    rendered indistinct and vague by extreme distance; much as we look upon the Day
                        of<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7039-158"/> Judgment, or the day of our death, and
                    lo! here it was at the very doors.</p>
                <p>One day, very meekly and diffidently, for he began to perceive that his turtle
                    dove had not much coo in her, Sir Hugh suggested that there was no possible
                    reason why our marriage should be delayed; that there was, on the contrary,
                    every reason why it should be hastened. But mild and deferential as was the poor
                    fellow's mode of address, I blazed out upon him; thrust the idea miles away from
                    me, and snubbed him for his want of feeling, in talking of marrying and giving
                    in marriage, when my father was in the state he then was. That was in the
                    morning; in the afternoon, my father repeated Sir Hugh's very words almost.</p>
                <p>The daily walk had been given up by this time: all day long my old man sat in his
                    leathern armâchair, waitingâwaiting. The pitcher was breaking very fast now; it
                    would go but few more journeys to the fountain.</p>
                <p>All day nearly, I sat beside him on a low stool, holding his hand, kissing it<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7039-159"/> every now and then, and watering it with
                    tears, as the Magdalen did that tender Godâhand, that is stretched out ever to
                    heal all wounds.</p>
                <p><q>
                        <l>ââI'm wearing awa', Jean,</l>
                        <l>Like snow when it's thaw, Jean,</l>
                        <l>I'm wearing awa', Jean,</l>
                        <l>To the Land o' the Leal,ââ</l>
                    </q> says my father softly, brokenly; for speech is getting difficult,
                    breathless to him. âIt's rather hard work, Nell, âwearing awaâ; I wish I could
                    be quicker about it.â My hot tears and kisses fall on the worn hand I must so
                    soon loose for ever, but I cannot answer him in words. âHugh is a good fellow,
                    isn't he?â says my father, presently. âI like to think of his being so fond of
                    my little girl; I wish you and he were married, Nell!â</p>
                <p>âDo you, Dad?â I say, choking.</p>
                <p>âYes, little lass, and then he could take you home and comfort you, when I'm
                    gone!â</p>
                <p>âCold comfort, I think, Dad,â I say, laying my russet head on the arm of his
                    chair, âbut ifâif it'll give you any<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7039-160"/> pleasure,
                    I'll marry him toâmorrow.â And this was how it came about.</p>
                <q>
                    <l>âThe Queen laid her white throat on the block,</l>
                    <l>Quietly waiting the fatal shock.â</l>
                </q>
                <p>The parson has been advertised, the licence and the ring have been bought, and we
                    are to be made one, as fast as bell, book and candle can make us. How sound I
                    slept on the night before my bridal; people going to be hanged, or guillotined,
                    or beheaded, always do, they say. I slept, and I had a very fair dream; a vague
                    sweet dream of flowersâgreat, beautiful flowers, crimson and white and azure,
                    and of a garden. And among the flowers, and in the garden, I saw Dick; saw him
                    in all his beauty, saw <q>
                        <l>âThe knotted column of his throat,</l>
                        <l>The massive square of his heroic breast,</l>
                        <l>And arms on which the standing muscle sloped;â</l>
                    </q> saw him coming quickly over the springy green turf to meet me, with a great
                    glory of sunshine about his stately head; and I stretched out eager arms towards
                    him, and cried, âI'm coming, love, I'm coming!â<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7039-161"/> and so crying, I woke to find myself embracing the empty air; woke as Nelly
                    Lestrange for the last time in my life.</p>
                <p>âThis is my wedding day.â With what trembling rapture, with what shy shrinking
                    from her own great passionate joy, has many a girl said this. I felt no tremor,
                    no shyness; only a huge loathing, an infinite despair! One forgets to be coy and
                    maidenly, when one's every pulse and nerve is thrilling with a mighty horror;
                    when, loving one man frenziedly, one is about to be delivered over, bound to the
                    tender mercies of another.</p>
                <p>No friends came together to see me wed; there was no sound of mirth or music
                    about the dim old rooms: this was no time for merryâmaking, when the head of the
                    Lestranges was nearing his last dark home. This ceremony was, we all felt, but
                    the precursor of a solemner, sadder one. Only one uncle, a selfish bachelor
                    colonel, had been drawn down reluctant, from his clubs and his comfortable
                    chambers in the Albany, into the murk, wintry country, to give me away.</p>
                <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7039-162"/>
                <p>Eleven o'clock was the hour, at which the poor lamb's throat was to be cut; the
                    female martyr ascend the pyre. As the time drew near, Dolly and Mrs. Smith and
                    Mary the housemaid, all came bustling and fussing about me, in my little shabby,
                    chill chamber; giving a tweak here, and a pull there, and a jerk somewhere else,
                    to one or another of my wedding garments, as seemed good in their eyes. I,
                    meanwhile, stood gazing stonily at myself in the glass. I was dressed in a white
                    muslin gown, as simple as a nun's, a white cloak and a little white bonnet, and
                    I looked as like a snowâdrop as possible; as fair, as cold, as passionless. My
                    face was not distorted and blurred with tear marks now; my tears seemed all
                    shed: I had been a spendâthrift of them lately.</p>
                <p>Toâday, I could not have wept to save my life. A very miserable looking face the
                    lookingâglass gave back to me, but a very lovely one, as I could not help
                    seeing: lovelier in its colourless, hopeless wistfulness, with its great blue
                    eyes, and its ruddy billowing hair, than even<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7039-163"/>
                    Dolly's in its subtle Eastern sweetness.</p>
                <p>âI'm worth my price,â I say to myself, bitterly.</p>
                <p>Then they get me downstairs somehow, and into the Noah's ark of the family coach.
                    As we drive along to the church, I sit staring blankly before me, while my
                    uncle, the Colonel, a little withered spickâandâspan cockâsparrow, chirrups
                    small oldâworld <foreign xml:lang="fre">politesses</foreign> to Dolly,âwhom he
                    thinks âa monstrous fine woman, egad,ââhis style of commendation savouring of
                    the Regencyâand who takes them suavely, honiedly, as she would take the vilest,
                    most opprobrious epithets ever applied to woman toâday, being, forsooth, in
                    highest good humour.</p>
                <p>The air is full of snow; flakes are sailing crookedly down to join the other
                    flakes lying already on tree, and hedgeârow, and field. There seems no horizon
                    toâday, no definite boundary to the prospectâsky and earth are mixed and jumbled
                    up together; it is freezing and thawing, freezing and thawing every five
                    minutes.</p>
                <pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7039-164"/>
                <p>At the lych gate we get out. My uncle gives me his arm, and leads me up the
                    narrow gravel walk, where half a dozen perished schoolâchildren, three
                    blueânosed, pinched old women, and a purple hobbledehoy are assembled as
                    witnesses of this gay show. There is a thin white shroud stretched over the
                    sloping green mounds, thin and scant as a beggar's cloak; the snow has dropped
                    her chill, pure pall over the quiet dead as they lie slumbering together in
                    families and households.</p>
                <p>Sir Hughâ<emph>my</emph> Sir Hugh, my ownâand his best man, the largeâheaded
                    young cotton lord, meet us at the church door; Sir Hugh in a blue frockâcoat, a
                    blue tie, and a redâbrown countenance, which all set each other off very nicely. <q>
                        <l>âThere was colour in his cheek,</l>
                        <l>There was lustre in his eye,â</l>
                    </q> and there was a bouquet as big as a haystack in his hand, a bouquet of
                    delicatest hotâhouse ferns and whitest hotâhouse flowers, flowers waxiest of
                    petal and<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7039-165"/> heaviest of scent. This posy he
                    immediately presented to me, and Lord Stockport, of the many mills, did likewise
                    with a lesser haystack to Dolly. I said, âthank you,â coldly, took it and held
                    it in my hand, without its ever occurring to me to smell it or notice it any
                    further.</p>
                <p>Then we arranged ourselves before the altar. Of course, Hugh disposed himself on
                    the wrong side of me, and had to be pushed, and nudged, and scolded into his
                    right place. Then Mr. Bowles, whose long nose was redder than a plume reft from
                    the flamingo's using, and whose teeth I heard like castanets played by a skilful
                    hand, opened the prayerâbook, and began to tie the first loop of the Gordian
                    knot. I paid but small heed to his exhortation; my eyes kept wandering from Sir
                    Adrian Lestrange, who â<foreign xml:lang="lat">obdormivit in pace,
                        Ã¦tat</foreign> 26,â in gray marble at my right, to Sir Brian, who âdeparted
                    this life in the 24th year of his age,â in white marble at my left.
                        <emph>He</emph> was deeply regretted; Sir Adrian was <emph>not</emph>
                    apparently. We were not a longâlived family, any of us.</p>
                <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7039-166"/>
                <p>âI require and charge you both, as ye shall answer at the dreadful Day of
                    Judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed,â said the Rev.
                    Bowles.</p>
                <p>He read at a handâgallop, and very much through his nose, but, try as he would,
                    he could not take quite all the dignity and awe out of that solemnnest
                    adjuration. It called back my straying thoughts; it stirred my apathy. The cold,
                    vaultâlike air crept through my thin clothing, and chilled the marrow of my
                    bones; and a colder, bitterer chill grasped at my heart, as I listened to the
                    grave, grand words.</p>
                <p>Then Sir Hugh was asked whether he would âtake this woman to be his wedded wife,â
                    and he said, âI will,â in his strong bass voice, heartily, loud, out, as if he
                    meant it, and as if he was glad to be asked. And the same question was put to me
                    with regard to âthis man,â and I said âI willâ also; but said it with as much
                    life and animation as a doll shows when she opens her eyes, the string at her
                    side being pulled.</p>
                <pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7039-167"/>
                <p>So he, Hugh de Vere, takes me, Eleanor, âtill death us do part,â and I, Eleanor,
                    take him, Hugh de Vere, and do it with a bad grace, as if I would not have taken
                    him if I could have helped it, and then Hugh put the ringâpledge of a worse than
                    Egyptian bondageâover my cold, reluctant fingers, and the bells clashed out, and
                    we were man and wife, and I knew that now I could reach my darling's arms only
                    through the billows of sin or the floods of death.</p>
                <p>The deed being done, and Mr. Bowles having made his congratulations as
                    intelligibly as his chattering teeth would allow him, we signed our namesâHugh
                    de Vere Lancaster, very bold and firm; Eleanor Lestrange, very wobbly and
                    illegible; and then Hugh hurried me off into his brougham, which was waiting at
                    the gate.</p>
                <p>âGod tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,â says the proverb, and I thanked God
                    devoutly that that drive was but a short one. During it I spoke not a word; if I
                    had attempted to utter, I felt that I<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7039-168"/> should
                    have shrieked aloud in my great agony.</p>
                <p>I find my father in the hall, come out to welcome back his little daughter. He
                    has put his old Sunday coat on to do me honourâthe coat that I remember so many
                    years, and which is so much too big for him now, hangs about him in such pitiful
                    folds and wrinkles.</p>
                <p>I throw myself passionately into his arms.</p>
                <p>âKiss me, dadâkiss me!â I cry, a little wildly. âI don't feel like myself toâday,
                    somehow. I'm <emph>your</emph> Nell stillâaren't I?âthough I <emph>am</emph>
                    married.â</p>
                <p>My father holds out his hand to Sir Hugh, and smiles his pleasant, tender
                    smile.</p>
                <p>âShe has been made such a pet of all her life, you see,â he says, with gentle
                    apology.</p>
                <p>(Death is smoothing all the little asperities out of him, dear noble old
                    father.)</p>
                <p>âShe has been her old father's spoilt childâhaven't you, Little Nell? You'll be
                    good to herâwon't you? She has been a<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7039-169"/> very
                    loving little daughter to me, and they say good daughters always make good
                    wivesâdon't they?â</p>
                <p>Then he stops, out of breath.</p>
                <p>âI will be good to her, indeed, Sir Adrian,â says Hugh, solemnly, âso help me,
                    God.â</p>
                <p>And he has been good to me, honest fellowâhe has kept his word.</p>

                <p><hi>I MAY</hi> put away all the bright colours out of my paint box, for they have
                    gone out of my life; so I need no longer lake, or carmime, or ultraâmarine. My
                    few more pictures are dark as Rembrandt's; without his forges, and fires, and
                    patches of crimson light to set them off. I made but one stipulation with my
                    husband; and that was that immediately after the ceremony, he should return to
                    Wentworth, <foreign xml:lang="fre">en garÃ§on</foreign>, and leave me in peace,
                    to tend and nurse my father, untilâI did not express in words, until what;
                    hardly to myself did I dare give shape and substance to my woeâuntil the end. I
                    had sacrificed myself, in order to prolong my old man's life, and on the day but
                    one after my wedding, he died.</p>
                <pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7039-171"/>
                <p>Thus it is with our little feeble plans and designs, in this troublesome world.
                    The sacrifice had been offered in vain. I have told you how strenuously my
                    father opposed all endeavours to make an invalid of him. Well, on that last day
                    he had to succumb: the stout spirit had to give in to the failing flesh; One,
                    mightier than he, overcame him.</p>
                <p>So he lay in bed, very quietly, very patiently, waiting,âwaiting, and panting
                    sorely. During all those dragging, weary hours, I sat by him, holding his hand;
                    as if <emph>that</emph> could keep him back from the gulf he was nearing. The
                    snow floated down noiselessly on the window sill, and rested there, soft and
                    flaky: the clock ticked monotonous, and the short wintry day sloped westward
                    towards the night.</p>
                <p>âIt's all up with me, Nell,â said my father, faintly; âI'm getting a very
                    brokenâwinded old horse, aren't I?â</p>
                <p>Byâandâby I got mother's old Bible, with her dim faded pencilâmarks; the shabby
                    little Bible he always used; and read him bits out of it; comfortable, <choice>
                        <orig>tenâ</orig>
                        <reg>tender</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7039-172"/> der promises suited to the weakness
                    of approaching dissolution; and he said,</p>
                <p>âThank you, little lass, it's very nice;â but he could not attend to me long. It
                    is hard work dying; a bitter weary tussle; but ah! surely it is harder seeing
                    another die. I sat and listened to the gasping breath, that grew ever quicker,
                    harder, shorter; it made me out of breath myself to hear him labouring, panting
                    so. O God! how I longed to be able to <q>
                        <l>âGive him half my powers,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">To eke his being out.â</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>Then day died, and the snow lay thicker, and the darkness fell. Presently Mrs.
                    Smith came in with ostentatious tiptoe tread, and came creaking over, with a cup
                    of tea for me, and turned away with big tears on her old cheeks; (there were
                    none on mine). And then the doctor came in, with long face, and lowered voice,
                    and told me he was sinking fastâGod! as if I did not know thatâand poured out
                    some brandy into a glass for me to give him. But I said I would not,<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7039-173"/> rudely, angrily; pushed it away from me; told them he
                    should die in peace, and that they should not torment himâI hated to see that
                    careless indifferent stranger come to gape and croak over him , in his mortal
                    weakness.</p>
                <p>So they left me and my old man alone together, we had always loved to be
                    together, hadn't we? The wind rose a little at nightfall, and came sighing,
                    sobbing, <emph>keening</emph>, about the old eaves and gables, and the snow
                    turned to sleet, and beat and pattered against the panes. It seemed so hard to
                    die on such a night; so hard for a poor bare soul to go shuddering out into the
                    great dark void. I could have let him go from me better, I thought, on some
                    bright warm summer nooning, when you could almost see heaven's gates a long way
                    up in the azure depths.</p>
                <p>Gradually he sank into a stupor; He who does all things well, took away from him
                    all knowledge of past, present, and to come; all consciousness of his pains and
                    aches; of his debts and his sorrows, and even of his little pet daughter, <choice>
                        <orig>kneelâ</orig>
                        <reg>kneeling</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7039-174"/> ing by his bedside, with her head in
                    the counterpane, choking and shaking in her sobs.</p>
                <p>The night deepened, waned; the candles flared tall and yellow, and the wind sank:
                    still I knelt on, holding the hand that was ever growing colder, colder, with my
                    eyes riveted on that sunken face, that looked so old, so gray, and so very
                    peaceful: I was learning off every pathetic line and hollow in it; printing it
                    on my icy desolate heart, against the time when I should have but memory left of
                    him.</p>
                <p>The breathing had grown fainter, fainter; sometimes it paused quite, for a second
                    or two, then laboured on for a space, intermittent, feeble; the pauses grew
                    longerâlonger; the gasps lowerâweakerâweakerâthen stopped! And about the fourth
                    watch of the night came One into that upper chamberâOne that had not been there
                    before. A great quiet awe stole over me: I rose from my knees very gently,
                    reverently, and bent over him.</p>
                <p>âHe is gone!â I said to myselfâwhen<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7039-175"/> suddenly
                    the old kind eves opened once again <emph>wide</emph>, with an infinite glad
                    surprise in them, as if they saw some pleasant jocund sightâMy old man! God
                    grant that it was so!âand then the eyelids closed again very softly, and he was
                    not.</p>
                <p>So the family vault of the Lestranges was opened, and the good gray head went
                    down into the dust, whither all heads go at last. I hope they'll bury me with
                    him when I die. I should like that last grand trumpet blare to find us together.
                    And they carried him awayâ<emph>him</emph>, that dead coffined weightâah! not
                        <emph>him</emph>, not <emph>him</emph>, reallyâaway from his pretty old
                    house, and his books, and his wretchedest, wretchedest âlittle lass.â As they
                    bore him slowly under the great elms, beneath whose shade he and I had so often
                    walked, holding sweet converse, the snow fell heavy and thick, whitened the
                    black pall, and sent its feathery, icy flakes against my face, as I walked
                    behind.</p>
                <p>I ought to have cried, I suppose, that day; Dolly did; even Mrs. Smith and the
                    other servants did; and I looked at them<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7039-176"/> with
                    a certain stolid surprise. I did not cry; I was not the least inclined; I felt
                    no particular pain or grief, only an infinite, numb apathy. So they bore him
                    through the lych gate, and into the church, and we said the solemn goodâbye
                    words to himâhe lying there deaf, unheeding of our farewells; and then they laid
                    him in the yawning grave (we standing round), and the snow flakes fell on the
                    coffinâplate, that told how Sir Adrian Lestrange departed this life on the 30th
                    day of December, 186â. And then we turned away and left him, and I was sorry as
                    one that had no hope.</p>

                    will find no Nelly Lestrange to greet him. He will miss the girl whom he has
                    watched grow up from a little toddling pinafored child, to a fair, tall, comely
                    womanâwill miss the happy, foolish innocent face that has smiled back to him
                    across the hayâfield, on so many dewy June mornings. Nelly Lestrange, with her
                    light heart, her tumbledown Spanish castles, and her silly little tender jokes,
                    has gone away, not from that room only, but from the world.</p>
                <pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7039-178"/>
                <p>They buried her yesterday in that dull chamber, where Death is holding his
                    carnival among the Lestranges, and have left only a very heavyâhearted Nell
                    Lancaster in her stead.</p>
                <p>I am sitting in my father's bedroom, on the floor; by the bed whereon he died,
                    and am kissing it. God has vouchsafed to me toâday the gift of tears. After he
                    was dead, when the warmth was gone out of the heart that would have bled less,
                    had it been colder, when his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left
                    in him. I had cut off a bit of his hair, and now the sight of the thin gray
                    lock, so sparse, so almost white, recalled to me with such bitter force the head
                    from which it was severed, that he being dead, yet spake. Oh God! is there any
                    verse that ever was penned by mortal fingers that grasps so at the universal
                    sympathies of this whole tearful world, as this one. <q>
                        <l>âOh Christ! that it were possible</l>
                        <l>For one short hour to see</l>
                        <l>The souls we loved, that they might tell us</l>
                        <l>What and where they be.â</l>

                <pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7039-179"/>
                <p>Before, when my old man had gone away from me, though he was beyond the reach of
                    my fond arms, beyond the province of the eye and the ear, I could yet picture
                    him to myself amongst familiar human surroundings; could imagine him sitting and
                    walking, making his kindly jests, and talking his clever pointed talk;
                        <emph>now</emph> the vagueness and the doubt rebuffed me.</p>
                <p>So far as I had gone with him, he had had a good journey, thank God! for he had
                    parted from me smiling; but alas! that was but a very little way on. I could but
                    take him to the great gates, and send him out into the night, and stand peering
                    with eager aching eyes after him, as he went forth into the blackness
                        <emph>alone</emph>.</p>
                <p>It is afternoon, and, but for the servants, I am alone in the house. Hugh is gone
                    over to Wentworth, whence he is to return later to fetch me, and Dolly is gone.
                    Dolly has been very busy all the morning, going about the house, and picking up
                    a little bit of china here, and a little bit of plate there. She has no
                    particular right to<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7039-180"/> them, although she says
                    very feelingly, that âpoor dear papaâ gave them to her, and so of course she
                    cannot bear the idea of their being put up to sale for any dreadful common
                    creatures; but when a house is in the confusion attendant upon an owner lately
                    dead, a little petty larceny is excusable, almost laudable.</p>
                <p>Half an hour ago, she set off on a long visit to some of her numerous friends;
                    she made a very pretty exit, crying a little, but not enough to disfigure
                    herself at the railway station, and shaking hands with all the servants. I have
                    cried myself into a state of semiâinsensibility; my head is resting on the
                    counterpane, and my lock of hair is lying in silver paper on my lap, when the
                    door opens, and Mrs. Smith says, very gently, âIf you please, my lady, Sir
                    Hugh's come back.â</p>
                <p>If I had thought about it, I should have recollected that there was nobody but
                    myself in the room; but somehow it never occurred to me to take the unfamiliar
                    appellation to myself. Mrs. Smith comes a little further into the room, and
                    repeats a tone or two louder.</p>
                <pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7039-181"/>
                <p>âIf you please, my lady, Sir Hugh's come and would like to speak to you,â I stare
                    up at her, <emph>dully</emph> scared for a minute; then jump up, throw my arms
                    about the old woman's neck, and lay my head on her kindly bosom.</p>
                <p>âDon't call me <emph>that!</emph>â I say whispering; âdon't! I hate it; call me
                    Miss Nell <emph>always</emph>; do you mind?â Mrs. Smith kisses my swollen face,
                    and strokes my disordered hair; it was homely, but very lovingly done, as Sir
                    Thomas More said of the maid Dorothy Collis, who embraced him as he went to
                    execution.</p>
                <p>âI'll call you what you like, my dear, in course; but indeedâindeed you should
                    not take on so; it's not right, it is not indeed; it was the Almighty's will as
                    he was took,â she says very shakily, âand, oh dear! he has been worritted a
                    deal, poor gentleman; I don't think you had oughter wish him back!â</p>
                <p>âI don't! I don't!â I cry, sobbing hysterically; âI'm not so cruel! do you think
                    I'm a <emph>fiend</emph>; but I only wish they'd<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7039-182"/> âlet meâlet meâgo to him; it's not wicked to say that is it?â</p>
                <p>âNot a bit wicked!â says Mrs. Smith, soothingly, âand so you will in the Lord's
                    good time; so we all shall, I 'ope; and for my part so as we was prepared, I
                    don't much care how soon.â Hugh, manlike, is getting impatient. I hear him
                    calling</p>
                <p>âNell! Nell!â</p>
                <p>It is not the same voice that was wont to come ringing up these stairs; it is a
                    younger, stronger, commoner one; the contrast comes coldly home to my heart.</p>
                <p>âI don't want to see him,â I say; pitifully to Mrs. Smith, and speaking as if I
                    had a very bad cold in my head; âgo and ask him to give me half an hour
                    more.â</p>
                <p>Mrs. Smith looks mild disapprobation.</p>
                <p>âNay, my dear, I don't think you had oughter keep him waiting; he's your 'usband,
                    you know, and he raly is as good a gentleman as ever trod shoeâleather; we
                    cannot expect everybody to be like them as is gone.â</p>
                <pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7039-183"/>
                <p>I have been rather meek and biddable from my youth up, so I go. Hugh is standing
                    at the foot of the stairs, whistling very softly to himself; it is almost as
                    inveterate a habit with him, as with Mr. Chick.</p>
                <p>âWhat a figure you have made of yourself, you poor little girl!â he says,
                    surveying rather ruefully, the purpleâeyed, redânosed, hollowâcheeked prize that
                    he has acquired.</p>
                <p>âI cannot help it!â I say, doggedly. âDo you want me? Mrs. Smith said you
                    did.â</p>
                <p>âI'd walk on my head from here to Wentworth, if it would do you any good,â he
                    says, disregarding my question, and looking sympathetic, as a really
                    goodânatured man would in the presence of a grief which it was equally beyond
                    his power to measure or assuage; âbut you really ought not to fret like this,
                    you'll be laid up, and you know it'sâit's <emph>Godalmighty'swill</emph>.â</p>
                <p>Hugh is very shy of pronouncing his Creator's name, and now does it with a<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7039-184"/> jerk, running the three words into one very
                    rapidly. I don't feel much consoled by the information, and go and sit down
                    listlessly, on the end of the servant's prayer bench. I have eaten nothing all
                    day, and am as weak as a cat.</p>
                <p>âWhat time will you be ready to start?â asks Hugh, seeing that his theological
                    gun has missed fire.</p>
                <p>âOh, must we go yet?â I cry, clasping my hands in despair, âI wanted to bid
                    goodâbye to all the old place!â</p>
                <p>Hugh looks down and pulls his grizzling moustache.</p>
                <p>âThe days are so short, you see,â he says âand it takes two hours to get there; I
                    don't want to bring the horses in hot; and mother will be getting anxious if we
                    are not back by dinner time!â</p>
                <p>âHow soon then?â I ask, giving up the point as I would give up any point
                    toâday.</p>
                <p>âWell, as soon as you can pop on your bonnet then. I'll go to the stables and
                    tell him to put the horses to; they're uncommon likely to take cold if they stay
                    there long, for it's as damp as aââ<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7039-185"/>
                    <emph>Vault</emph>, he was going to say, but it occurred to him, that, under the
                    circumstances, it might sound unfeeling.</p>
                <p>I rise and move towards the stairs again, dragging my legs after me.</p>
                <p>âOh, byâtheâby, Nell, which would you like to go in? the brougham or the double
                    dogâcartâthey are both here?â</p>
                <p>âOh not the dogâcart!â I say with an involuntary gesture of disgust.</p>
                <p>âWhy? it is not cold!â</p>
                <p>âIt reminds me of that dreadful day,â I say without thinking. (I somehow
                    attribute all my ills to that day.) I was enough to try the patience of the ten
                    best husbands in Britain, wasn't I? but then I was so miserable.</p>
                <p>Sir Hugh's kind, goodânatured face clouds a little.</p>
                <p>âThose were not the same pair,â he says, âand the cart cannot run away of
                    itself.â</p>
                <p>He does not relish the idea of a fourteen mile drive in a stuffy close carriage,
                    with a crying woman; even though she is his bride.</p>
                <pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7039-186"/>
                <p>âAs you wish,â I say indifferently, âit's all one to me.â</p>
                <p>So the dogâcart it is, and into it I get; a limp, nerveless figure, on which a
                    great deal of crape is hung, and over whose face a crape veil falls black and
                    thick as a December night. There has been one of those rapid changes in the
                    weather, which are common in our climate, so rich in unpleasant surprises. The
                    snow is all melted out of the sky, and the bitter wind has whistled and moaned
                    itself away to some other quarter of the earth. The air is as warm as April, and
                    the atmosphere that of a vapour bath.</p>
                <p>A dank blue mist hangs over the churchâyard. It is not raining, and yet the
                    tombstones are all streaming with wet, and great drops hang from the old ash's
                    naked boughs. I strain my neck back as long as the dim gray tower, and the great
                    dripping yews are in sight.</p>
                <p>âGoodâbye old dad!â I say to myself over and over again, âgoodâbye,â and then I
                    cry under my veil, bitterlier than ever.</p>
                <p>For the first five miles Hugh leaves me<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7039-187"/> pretty
                    much to my own devices; does not bring <emph>GodâAlmighty'sâwill</emph> to bear
                    on me again; he makes several remarks of a friendly nature to his horses, urging
                    them to steadiness of conduct, and throws out an inquiry or two as to the mode
                    of their entertainment at Lestrange to the groom.</p>
                <p>But he holds his tongue as far as the veiled statue beside him is concerned.</p>
                <p>The veiled statue unveils herself presently, and stows away her
                    pocketâhandkerchief in her pocket, having exhausted all the tears in her
                    lachrymatory. The lamps are lit, and we go spinning through the darknessâit is
                    quite dark by now. Splash! splash! go the horses' hoofs through the mud; a light
                    twinkles here and there cheerily, from a cottage window. <q>
                        <l>âSo shines a good deed in a naughty world.â</l>
                    </q> Immediately on perceiving this change in the weather, Hugh passes the reins
                    into his right hand, and puts his left arm round me. I am Sir Hugh's lawful wife
                    now; so this proceeding does not amuse the groom so much as it would have done
                        on<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7039-188"/> that former drive; it tickles him a
                    little however.</p>
                <p>âThat's right, old woman!â says my husband kindly; âcheer up! what's done cannot
                    be undone; but things are never so bad in this world that they might not be
                    worse.â</p>
                <p>The near horse shies; the arm is withdrawn, âSteady old boy! steady!â</p>
                <p>It is very unwifely of me, but I feel inclined to say <emph>Ta</emph> to that
                    timid quadruped.</p>
                <p>âI suppose, Nell,â says Hughâhe thinks that now that the ice is broken, a little
                    cheerful conversation will be highly salutary for meââI suppose, Nell, that poor
                    Dolly has got to her journey's end by now.â</p>
                <p>âI suppose so.â</p>
                <p>âHow long is she going to stay there? do you know?â</p>
                <p>âNo.â</p>
                <p>âWhat is she going to do with herself afterwards?â</p>
                <p>âI don't know.â (My tone said âI don't care either.â)</p>
                <p>âPoor girl! it's very sad for her not<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7039-189"/> having a
                    hole or corner to put her head in!â</p>
                <p>âShe has lots of friends.â</p>
                <p>âOh, ay! <emph>friends</emph> very likely; and people are very glad to have a
                    girl with them for a month, or <emph>two</emph> even; but one cannot
                        <emph>live</emph> on one's friends; that was what she was saying to me this
                    morning. We had a long talk before she went; I don't think I ever was so sorry
                    for any one in my life.â</p>
                <p>(The objects of compassion which Hugh meets whene'er he takes his walks abroad
                    are few apparently.)</p>
                <p>âDid she tell you what her plans were?â</p>
                <p>âWell, no! I don't think she had made up her mind; she came to ask my advice,
                    poor thing! and she seemed so cut up too, about thisâthisâaffair,â says Hugh,
                    rather at a loss for an expression, and jerking his head vaguely in the
                    direction of my father's death.</p>
                <p>âAwfully!â I say, ironically; âI don't suppose she'll ever get over it.â Hugh
                    does not heed my sneer. When once he is off on a train of thought, he runs
                        along<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7039-190"/> it like a mad dog; turning neither
                    to the right nor to the left.</p>
                <p>âDo you know what my advice was, Nell? I suppose I ought to have asked you first,
                    but I felt sure of not meeting with much opposition from youâthe old lady is the
                    only difficulty; she is so <emph>ratchetty</emph> now and then, and always hates
                    new faces, too!â</p>
                <p>âWhat was your advice?â I ask, startled.</p>
                <p>âWhy to come and keep house with us, till she marriesâthat'll be sure not to be
                    long first!â</p>
                <p>âOh!â say I, blankly, and my tone is not exultant. Hugh was right just now; there
                    is no state of things so bad but that it may not be worse.</p>
                <p>âSeems such a natural arrangement! own sister!âparents dead!âno home!â says Hugh,
                    becoming ejaculatory, and not quite so certain of my approbation as he was five
                    minutes ago.</p>
                <p>âIt was very kind of you,â I say, gently.</p>
                <p>I feel that I am receiving what he <choice>
                        <orig>inâ</orig>
                        <reg>intended</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7039-191"/> tended as a pleasant surprise for
                    me, rather ungraciously.</p>
                <p>âOh, no! not at all! she is a great ally of mine; she has always been a good
                    friend to me, even in the days when you used to snub me, Nell!â</p>
                <p>âYes.â</p>
                <p>âOf course, I don't mean to say that my principle motive in asking her, was not
                    that I thought you would be pleased to have such a nice companion, and one that
                    you have been used to all your life too; mother is all very well in her way, of
                    courseâI don't mean to say a word against herâbut I should not think that you
                    and she would be likely to have many ideas in common, and of course I cannot be
                    with you all day; there's the farm, you know, and hunting five days a week,
                    andâandââ says poor Hugh, rather discomfited at the illâsuccess of his little
                    benevolent scheme, and trying to make out the best case he can for himself.</p>
                <p>âIt was very good of you!â I say again very gratefully; âand what answer did she
                    make?â</p>
                <pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7039-192"/>
                <p>Hugh looks rather foolish.</p>
                <p>âOh, poor girl! why I really think she hardly knew what she was doing; she cried
                    and wanted to go down on her knees to thank me, only of course I could not stand
                    that;â (wretched as I am, I laugh grimly to myself, as I picture the little
                    tableauâDolly going gracefully down on her knees, and poor Hugh in dire
                    confusion hauling her up again; I think if she had reflected that it would in
                    all probability go back to me, she would have refrained from that little bit of
                    melodrama) âand that of course it was a great boon to a poor homeless girl like
                    her, and that she dare say'd she should not trouble us long. I don't know what
                    she meant by that, I'm sure, unless she has got somebody in her eyeâandâand that
                    she'd come, I suppose!â</p>
                <p>I say âOh!â again, and the subject drops.</p>
                <p>I feel that it would seem unnatural in me to object, and I could as soon fly in
                    the air as express any elation at the intelligence. My legs feel very stiff, and
                    I am<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7039-193"/> weary, as Hugh lifts me down at Wentworth
                    Hall door.</p>
                <p>Last time I saw that door, Dick was leaning against itâI don't even think of Dick
                    toâday somehow. I follow Hugh into the library, where lights are blazing and the
                    curtains are drawn, and a tall old lady in blackâshe has put on complimentary
                    mourningâreceives me in her arms, and kissing me, says with prim stateliness,
                    but very kindly withal, âWelcome home, my dear daughter!â</p>
                <p>Alas! she is the only person whose daughter I am now.</p>

                <p><hi>THEY</hi> tell us, don't they, that one of the mercifullest dispensations of
                    Providence is our facility for forgettingâthe ease and quickness with which we
                    get over things? To me it seems that what points the sting of every grief, is
                    the thought that a time will come when we shall grieve no more. It is terrible
                    enough, God wot, for a person to drop out of our lives; but to drop out of our
                    hearts too. Ah, poor dead ones! is not that hard?</p>
                <p>As long as their memory is with us fresh and greenâas long as it lives with us,
                    as they themselves lived with us, coming in and going out, in the house and in
                    the street, in talk and in silence, on Sundays and on weekâdaysâso long do we
                    seem to<pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7039-195"/> keep a little portion of them with us;
                    they do not seem quite gone away from us.</p>
                <p>But the same thing happened to us all. Strive and resolve as we may to keep our
                    sorrow fresh and new and glossy, it is all to no purpose; it grows insensibly
                    old and stale and shabby, like the crape round our hats. Have not you, oh
                    friends, before now, seeing some acquaintance who had just issued out of great
                    tribulation, laughing and talking, apparently unchangedâhave not you said within
                    yourselfâhow unfeeling he is! how different I should be!</p>
                <p>And lo! the apple of <emph>your</emph> eye is taken away from you, and in a week
                    or two you also are laughing and talkingâthe river of your life flows on smooth,
                    unruffled, as if that newâmade grave were razed out of creation.</p>
                <p>âOut of sight, out of mind,â is true to a certain extent of all of us. We cannot
                    be always thinking of what we never see: that is the very thing that makes it so
                    difficult for us to rest our minds on heaven, and heaven's high King; we cannot
                        see<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7039-196"/> them, and so we but feebly,
                    transiently realize them.</p>
                <p>The people we <emph>see</emph>, who talk to us, and we to them, whom we can hear
                    and touch and feel, gradually fill more and more of that vacant space: the
                    overpowering force of time saps our woes, as a little wave, plashing through
                    long aeons, wears and hollows at last the great granite rock.</p>
                <p>But oh! we don't forget, really! I don't mean you to think that. The wound heals
                    over slightly; we could not all walk about with great gaping gashes, could we?
                    The world's work could not get done if we did; but beneath the surface that
                    looks all fair and even, there is a great dull ache going on alwaysâan ache that
                    takes the taste out of our life's savoury meats, and makes us call our short day
                    all too long.</p>
                <p>A month has gone byâa wintry, sleety, dreary month. People have got tired of
                    talking of Sir Hugh Lancaster's wedding, and Sir Adrian Lestrange's death. Other
                    men and women have been wed and died since; and new subjects have supplanted
                    those two, which were of intensest interest<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7039-197"/> to
                    but one or at most two people. And there has been a sale at Lestrange; the old
                    oak chairs and tables have been knocked down to the highest bidder; scattered
                    among the neighbouring sons of Manchester and Liverpool: and the old rooms look
                    strange and piteous and unfurnished without them.</p>
                <p>And greasy Jewsâthe offscouring of the earthâ(my one point of sympathy with the
                        <foreign xml:lang="fre">moyen Ã¢ge</foreign> barbarians is their loathing and
                    maltreatment of the accursed Israelitish dog)âhave been prowling about, trading,
                    as is their wont, on the miseries and weaknesses of poor humanity. And Hugh,
                    good old fellow, has bought the old leathern armâchair for me: I am sitting in
                    it now; I hope I shall die in it.</p>
                <p>I have been transplanted from Lestrange to Wentworth, and the transplantation has
                    not killed me. I am a hardier plant than I thought I was. I don't cry all day,
                    by any means, and I laugh now and then when anything in my husband or his
                    belongings strikes me<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7039-198"/> in a ridiculous light,
                    which is not seldom. I am hungry and eat, I sleep sound, I still have likes and
                    dislikes, I make jokes occasionally; I squabble about every two days with my
                    mammaâinâlaw, when she tries to give me lectures on deportment, and <foreign xml:lang="fre">le bon Dieu</foreign>, still gives me energy to snub Hugh as
                    seemeth good unto me. Do you suppose from this that I accepted my fate meekly,
                    that I was beginning to get reconciled to it? Not I!</p>
                <p>My father's death I should have got over in time perhaps: it is natural that
                    parents should go before their children, and I might have got to think of him
                    without torture, with a gentle eternal regret and âsehnung,â as the Germans say.
                    I doubt even that; doubt my ever forgetting my old dad even if I had had Dick to
                    kiss away my tears, and supply the place of all other loves by his great
                    passionate one. Now that the first <foreign xml:lang="fre">Ã©clat</foreign> and
                    excitement of my sacrifice were overâ<emph>now</emph> that I knew for certain
                    that I had slain myself in vain, knew that he<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7039-199"/>
                    for whom I had been offered up was sleeping with his fathers beneath the chancel
                    of Lestrange, never to be wakened by my loudest, piercingest cries, then my
                    misery rose up before me, huge, unnatural, gigantic; terribler âthan ever woman
                    wore.â I was like Jonah when his gourd died down. I said, âI do well to be
                    angry, even unto death.â âWhy,â I cried, âwas I to be picked out from among all
                    women, to be preâeminently wretched?â</p>
                <p>The little worthless earthenware pitcher, picked a quarrel with the potter who
                    framed it. I did not love Hugh one bit; it is not easy to love two men at once;
                    to tell you the truth, I did not try much, sometimes I loathed him. And yet he
                    was very good to me, as good as could be. I verily believe that he loved me as
                    much as he could love any created thing; it was not his fault, poor fellow, that
                    he was not made of the finest porcelain, but was only good, useful, ugly Delf.
                    He was not to blame that Providence had made him a little, dark, middleâaged<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7039-200"/> baronet, instead of a great beautiful fair
                    dragoon.</p>
                <p>I am sure that he appreciated my varied excellences, and even ruggednesses, as
                    much as man could; and was fully alive to the advantage he had gained in having
                    a pretty young white face opposite to him every day at dinner, instead of an old
                    yellow ugly one. He was a most loving husband; horribly, needlessly, irksomely
                    loving, I said to myself. One has not much power of simulation or dissimulation
                    at nineteen; but I did my best to hide my disrelish for my lord, and to receive
                    his blandishments with as good a grace as I could.</p>
                <p>I was his chattel as much as his pet leanâheaded bay mare, and I felt that he had
                    justice on his side. If he might not insinuate his arm round my
                        <emph>waist</emph>, round whose waist might he? Sometimes I will confess to
                    you that I wished he would transfer his amities to some other person, even if it
                    were the cook. I'm sure I should not have been jealous. All Sir Hugh's other
                    servants, if they<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7039-201"/> disliked their situations,
                    or got tired of them, might give warning and leave; but I, however wearied I
                    might get of mine, could never give warning, could never leave. I was a fixture
                    for life. So I said to myself sometimes, and ground my teeth, and snarled like a
                    caged tiger.</p>
                <p>I had indulged a mild vague hope that the very words of the marriage ceremony
                    read over me, would have a cabalistic charm to prevent my ever thinking of any
                    man but Sir Hugh, after we were man and wife. I had heard that only very bad
                    wicked women ever cared for anybody but their husbands after they were married,
                    and I hoped I was not a very bad wicked woman.</p>
                <p>However, I discovered pretty soon with some chagrin that I must reckon myself
                    among that naughty band; that I was not one of those âwho love their lords;â not
                    âa matron of Cornelia's mien.â I found that I thought of Dick infinitely more;
                    more regretfully, passionately, longingly, now that I was Lady Lancaster,<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7039-202"/> and it was criminal of me so to think, <choice>
                        <corr>than</corr>
                        <sic>then</sic>
                    </choice> I had done as Nelly Lestrange, when it was only unwise and unworldly.
                    Nor was this mere womanly perversity, hankering after the unattainable; nor did
                    it spring from any idea that it was rather fine to be immoral. I thought of him
                    because I had nothing else pleasant to think of. The one person who had ever
                    halved my heart with him was gone from me.</p>
                <p>I <emph>hated</emph> to think of my father, not having that living faith accorded
                    to some, which enables them to say from their hearts, that their dead ones are
                    ânot dead but gone before.â My father was dead to me, dead as the old dog who
                    died the other day licking my hand. I <emph>knew</emph> I never should see him
                    again.</p>
                <p>How did I know whither he was gone; how did I know whether he had gone to any
                    good place; and if he had, what right had I to think that I should ever rejoin
                    him there? I did not believe in any heaven with sufficient strength to make me
                    strive very strenuously to attain it.</p>
                <pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7039-203"/>
                <p>Life seemed to me a great vast chaos, through which men stumbled and tottered to
                    a big black pit at the end. So I thought on the forbidden theme all the day, and
                    sometimes all the night; and truly there was not much at Wentworth to distract
                    my thoughts. A lapâdog would have thought my existence paradise; for I had
                    plenty of the best to eat, and big fires to bask in; but for myself, I thought
                    it a very dull gehenna.</p>
                <p>All through the wintry morning I sat on a gilt chair, clad from head to foot in
                    thickest silk and blackest crape, in the yellow drawingâroom, every stick of
                    whose ugly furniture spoke to me of <emph>him</emph>; while my motherâinâlaw
                    knitted socks for her beloved sonâshe was a thrifty old soul, and would fain
                    have had me do likewiseâand narrated to me apochryphal tales of Hugh's extreme
                    beauty in infancy; thrilling anecdotes of his childhood, and of how he caught
                    the measles; of his habits and customs at various periods of his history; of how
                    often he had broken his collarâbone, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                <pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7039-204"/>
                <p>In the afternoon I either went behind the fat coachâhorses, to pay solemn calls
                    to neighbouring matrons, accompanied as before, by our mamma, or else, when it
                    was not a hunting day, I pottered about the premises with Hugh, heard his
                    horses' pedigrees, and thought, with a frosty chill at my heart, of those other
                    saunters at Lestrange, about shabbier stables, with the dear old man who was
                    not.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, but very rarely, I managed to shirk out by myself, to put on the
                    dowdiest cloak and hat I could find, to take off my ring, and dawdle and wander
                    and scramble about the park, and be Nelly Lestrangeâin my own eyes at leastâonce
                    again.</p>
                <p>In the evenings, we two women stitched and interchanged amicable nothings or mild
                    sparrings, while Hugh, having bestowed on me such postâcoenal caresses as he
                    felt inclined, went to sleep, and mostly snored.</p>
                <p>We were so sitting one evening after dinnerâLady Lancaster, senior, clickâ<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7039-205"/> clacking away at that eternal knitting; Sir
                    Hugh not quite asleep yet, but reading the <bibl><title>Times</title></bibl> as a narcotic; and
                    Lady Lancaster, junior, toiling unlovingly at a smokingâcap for her master, and
                    glancing now and then from him to his mother, from the lean grizzling head and
                    bristles to the yellow front and wrinkles, and crying out to herselfâ</p>
                <p>âOh, how sick I am of you both. Oh, if I could but get awayâoh, if I only
                    could!â</p>
                <p>Then Hugh spoke.</p>
                <p>âMother, do you recollect M'Gregor?â</p>
                <p>âM'Gregor, my dear boy; what M'Gregor?âthere are so many M'Gregors. There is your
                    poor father's friend, Sir Malcolm, and there's General M'Gregor?â</p>
                <p>âNo, no,â interrupts her son, ânone of those old fogies. I mean a big,
                    goodâlooking fellow that was here last year. Don't you remember?â</p>
                <p>âTo be sure,â says mamma, calmly; âhe spilt a cup of coffee over my lavender
                    satinâI had to have the breadth taken out; and I remember remarking that he<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7039-206"/> seemed very attentive to Dorothea Lestrange.
                    Yes, I remember the young man perfectly.â</p>
                <p>âDo you happen to recollect the number of his regiment?â says Hugh, who is
                    widely, brilliantly awake by now.</p>
                <p>ââth Dragoons,â interpose I, breathlessly; âwhat about him?â</p>
                <p>âNothing, darling,â says Benedick, looking at me with lazy rapture, âonly I see
                    it's ordered to India.â</p>
                <p>âOrdered to India!â</p>
                <p>I rose and rushed hastily out of the room, very nearly falling foul of the
                    butler, who was bringing in tea, and disconcerting that grave functionary
                    considerably.</p>
                <p>Next day, Sir Hugh and his mother went to dine and sleep at a house in the
                    neighbourhood. My deep mourning of course excused me from accompanying them, and
                    a proud woman was I when their backs were fairly turned. I had begged and
                    entreated of my motherâinâlaw not to stay, or let Hugh stay at home on my
                    account; and she had commended my<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7039-207"/>
                    unselfishness, and had driven off in high good humour with âher boy.â</p>
                <p>âThank God!â said I, standing at the hallâdoor, and watching the carriage lamps
                    go twinkling down the dusky avenue. Then I returned slowly to the saloon, and
                    let my countenance fall into any woeâbegone dejected curves it chose, there
                    being nobody by to remark upon them.</p>
                <p>âOrdered to Indiaâordered to India!â Those three words had been dwelling in my
                    ears for the last twentyâfour hours, ceaselessly; the gilt clock on the
                    mantelpiece seemed to be ticking them now. âGoing to India to have his young
                    life scorched away, and I should <emph>never</emph> see him again.â It was not
                    that I should not see him again for a year, or for two, or for twenty years,
                        butâ<emph>never</emph>. I should never know how, why, or for what other
                    fairer, lovabler woman he had deserted me.</p>
                <p>An overpowering, mad longing seized me to go to him to ask him why he had been so
                    cruel to me, to ask him to take me with him to that far sultry land. What<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7039-208"/> did I care how wicked I was? My old man would
                    never know it, <q>
                        <l>âFor he was chill to praise or blame.â</l>
                    </q> It seemed to me, then, that the best thing we can do in this grievous world
                    is to snatch whatever present bliss we may, seeing that the past is all torture
                    and the future all nothingness. âLet us eat and drink, for toâmorrow we die,â
                    seemed to me the profoundest philosophy then. âIf there is eternal justice
                    somewhere,â said I to myself, âwhy is my punishment so much heavier than my
                    sins? I ask for so little; I don't expect, don't ask to be happyâI only beg for
                    exemption from bitterest, sharpest pain; I only ask for an easy death and quick
                    annihilation. Oh, to lay down my head in the kindly dustânot in a coffin, a
                    heavy, stifling, dreadful coffinâbut in the freshâscented, darkâbrown earth, and
                    with âlife's fitful feverâ for ever cooled, sleep on and on, till my body
                    âreturns to the earth as it was,â and my spiritâah, can <emph>it</emph>
                    sleep?â</p>
                <p>The fire burnt cheerily; the wax candles<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7039-209"/> shed a
                    soft lustre round them; the old china on mantelâshelf and table and cabinet
                    looked comfortable and snug and homelike; but I felt stifled, choking. I went to
                    the window, opened it, and stepped out into the verandah. A great gust of
                    rainâladen wind comes driving roughly against me, the French window behind me
                    bangs to, and I stand out on the wet flags, and watch the black clouds go
                    scudding, hurrying across the sky, for the moon is up and gives me light. It was
                    not cold, and I felt to breathe freer, leaning my face among the wet ivy, that
                    climbed and twisted round the further pillar of the verandah.</p>
                <p>âIt was here he kissed me; it was here he took me in his arms,â said I to myself,
                    nestling my head among the dripping green. âI thought I was going to spend my
                    life with him, and now I am alone, alone for evermore! Great Godâhow
                    unbearable!â</p>
                <p>Suddenly there comes a lull between two rainbursts; the moon comes sweeping out
                    from behind a great cloud shoulder;<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7039-210"/> the
                    Portugal laurel beside me shakes and rustles; and from behind it a man steps out
                    suddenlyâsteps out into the moonlit gravel walk, where the pebbles are
                    glittering like so many diamonds.</p>
            </div>
            <pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7039-211"/>

                <p><hi>NEED</hi> I tell you who the man was? For a second, I did not know myself;
                    for a second, I stood paralyzed by terror; then he came close up to me, and I
                    knew him; and a great flood of wicked, wonderful joy streamed into my soul and
                    nearly drowned it; as I looked up at the young giant with the haggard,
                    beautiful, angry face that was stooping over me.</p>
                <p>âI have been prowling about like a thief or a poacher,â he says, harshly; âI have
                    watched that fellow, your husband, out; I was determined I <emph>would</emph>

                    window, and the light from fire and candle flashes on him, as he stands there,
                    wet to the skin, big, shaggy, miserable. My heart goes out, with a great
                    yearning pity to him; âcome in,â I say, hastily; âyou're so wet; don't stand out
                    there!â I step back into the warm, scented room, and he, after hanging back a
                    minute, as if irresolute, follows me. We give each other no polite greeting; we
                    stand by the crackling, cheery fire blaze, and say nothing for a while; only we
                    look into each other's eyes, with passionate, desperate longing across the
                    mighty chasm that yawns between us. At length Dick says groaningly, as if the
                    words were wrenched from himâ</p>
                <p>âOh, Nell! Nell! why did you do this? why did you jilt me when I loved you
                    so?â</p>
                <p>The blood rushed boiling, surging into my cheeks and forehead and throat. I was a
                    meanâspirited woman; till he said that, I had absolutely forgotten his
                    illâtreatment of me.</p>
                <pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7039-213"/>
                <p>âHow dare you ask that?â I cried vehemently, âyou, who have blighted all my life
                    for me; you, who have been crueler to me than ever man was to woman before; you,
                    who never sent me word or sign, all through those weary six months; you, who had
                    not even the bare civility to answer the letters I wrote to you in my
                    misery!â</p>
                <p>I stopped, suffocated.</p>
                <p>âWhatâ<emph>do</emph>âyou mean?â said Dick, very slowly; he was spreading his
                    broad hands to the blaze, and his drenched pilot coat was steaming in the
                    warmth; at my upbraidings, no remorse, only intensest surprise came into his
                    face. âI never had but one letter from you, and <emph>that</emph> one you most
                    solemnly adjured me not to answer. Here it is! I have carried it about with me,
                    night and day, ever since I got it.â</p>
                <p>He put his hand into his breast pocket, and pulled out a letter. I snatched it
                    eagerly; it was like my handwriting, but it was not it; it was neater,
                    carefuller, more ornate. I turned to the signature;<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7039-214"/> there was none; then I read it through:â</p>
                <p>âMy dearest,âIt seems so odd and so pleasant, sitting down to write to you; but
                    oh! I'm grieved to have to tell you that this first letter must also be the
                    last; at least for ever so long. Don't be angry with me, but I told papa all
                    about you; you know how I love him, and I could not bear to keep anything from
                    him. Well! he was very <emph>very</emph> angry at first; would not hear of it at
                    all; said it was all nonsense, and that we had both behaved shamefully; but at
                    last, after a great deal of trouble and begging, I got him to come round so far
                    as to say, that if we both remained in the same mind for a year, he would then
                    listen to us; only he stipulated that we must neither see nor write to each
                    other during the year. I did my very best, as you may imagine, to make him
                    chance his decision, but all to no purpose! It seems a little hard, doesn't it?
                    and I cannot help crying a little sometimes, when I think of neither hearing
                    from, nor seeing you for so long; but, after all, a year will soon be gone, and
                    just think how happy we shall<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7039-215"/> be then.
                    Goodâbye, my darling; God bless you!</p>
                <p>âEver your own.</p>
                <p>âP.S.âI adjure and implore you not to answer this: <emph>I beg it of you as a
                        proof of your love</emph>. Papa would be sure to see the letter, and then we
                    should be in worse case than we are now even. Goodâbye again, my own
                    darling.â</p>
                <p>âI never wrote a word of it,â said I, compelling myself to speak very calmly,
                    though I clutched hold of a chair back for support. âNever; it's all a forgery;
                    this is Dolly's doing!â</p>
                <p>âWhat?â said he, gasping, and his strong frame staggered as under a mighty blow;
                    â.you never wrote this!â</p>
                <p>âNever,â said I, very solemnly. âI wrote you plenty of other letters to tell you
                    how much I loved you, and to ask you why you never wrote to me, as you promised
                    to do?â</p>
                <p>âAnd I never got one of them,â he said; and as he spoke, the blood retreated from
                    his lips, and left them livid.</p>
                <pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7039-216"/>
                <p>We stared at one another blankly; we were as if stunned.</p>
                <p>Presently he asked, hoarsely, âWhat made her do it?â</p>
                <p>âOh, I see it, I see it all!â I groaned, wringing my hands. âShe was determined I
                    should marry <emph>him</emph>,â (I could not mention his hated name), âand I've
                    done it; I have fallen into the trap she laid for me! Oh! I cannot bear it! I
                    cannot bear it!â</p>
                <p>I burst into loud sobbing, and throwing myself on the ottoman, buried my head in
                    the cushions.</p>
                <p>âSheâdevil,â said Dick, grinding his white teeth, like a wild beast in his rage
                    and agony, âI wish to God I had her here now, I'd tear her limb from limb,
                    though she is a woman; by Gâ I would!â</p>
                <p>âIf my heartiest, bitterest curse,â said I, vindictively, âcan do her any harm,
                    she has the comfort of knowing that she has got it;â and then I flung myself on
                    the floor, and wept afreshâwept till I was exhausted, and till my eyes had
                    nearly disappeared from their situations.</p>
                <pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7039-217"/>
                <p>He, meanwhile, stood with his elbow on the mantelâpiece, watching me, with his
                    angry, hopeless, passionate eyes; he did not attempt to give me any comfort; he
                    could not give what he had not got, poor fellow! and besides was not I another
                    man's wife? It was Sir Hugh's business to dry my tears, not his.</p>
                <p>âAnd so it's all a mistake! all a mistake!â he said at last, very brokenly, as if
                    to himself; and the gilt clock changed its tune, and went ticking on, âall a
                    mistake, all a mistake!â</p>
                <p>Then I rose from off the floor, and went and sat down on the ottoman again, and
                    forgot Sir Hugh's existence altogether. The rainy wind still blustered and
                    wailed and stormed outside; but yet the storm within our breasts was
                    mightier.</p>
                <p>âI cannot stand it any longer,â Dick said, vehemently, clenching his hand, and
                    bringing it down like a sledge hammer on the marble slab. âI must go, or I shall
                    make a beast of myself. Nell! I'm sailing for India toâmorrow; say one kind word
                    to me before I go. Oh, Nell! Nell! you<pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7039-218"/>
                    belonged to me before you belonged to him, damn him!â</p>
                <p>Looking into his haggard, beautiful, terrible face, I forgot all I should have
                    remembered; forgot virtue, and honour, and selfârespect; my heart spoke out to
                    his. âOh, don't, go!â I cried, running to him, âdon't you know how I love you?
                    for <emph>my</emph> sake stay; I cannot live without you!â</p>
                <p>I clasped both hands on his rough coat sleeve, and my bowed head sank down upon
                    them.</p>
                <p>âDo you suppose I can live in England and see you belonging to another man?â he
                    asked, harshly; âthe world is all hell now, as it is; but that would be the
                    blackest, nethermost hell! No, let me go,â he said, fiercely, pushing me away
                    from him roughly, while his face was writhen and distorted.</p>
                <p>âIf you go,â I said in my insanity, throwing myself into his arms, âI'll go too.
                    Oh! for God's sake take me with you.â</p>
                <p>He strained me to his desolate heart,<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7039-219"/> and we
                    kissed each other wildly, vehemently: none came between us then. Then he tried
                    to put me away from him.</p>
                <p>âMy darling,â he said, âyou don't know what you're saying; do you think I'm such
                    a brute as to be the ruin of the only woman I ever loved?â and his deep voice
                    was sorely shaken as he spoke.</p>
                <p>But I would not be put away: I clung about his neck, in my bitter pain.</p>
                <p>âI'd rather go to hell with you, than to heaven with him!â I cried,
                    blasphemously. âOh, don't leave me behind you! You're all I have in the world
                    now. Oh, take me, take me with you!â</p>
                <p>My hair fell in its splendid ruddy billows over his great shoulder, and my arms
                    were flung about the stately pillar of his throat.</p>
                <p>He set his teeth hard, and drew in his breath; it was a tough ordeal.</p>
                <p>âI won't,â he said, hoarsely; âfor God's sake stop tempting me. I'd sooner cut
                    your throat than take you. Do you think it would be loving you to bring you down
                    to a level with the scum of the earth? Oh, Nell! Nell! you ought to be my
                        good<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7039-220"/> angel. Don't tempt me to kill my own
                    soul and yours!â</p>
                <p>The reproachful anguish of his tones smote me like a twoâedged sword. I said no
                    more; I lay passive as a log in the arms that must so soon loose me for ever,
                    while the madness died slowly, frostily out of me.</p>
                <p>âI'm very wicked, I know,â I whispered piteously; âyou don't hate me, Dick, do
                    you, for wanting to go with you?â</p>
                <p>âHate you! my poor pretty darling; if you could but look into my heart, and see
                    what it is without you!â</p>
                <p>Great tears are standing in his honest, tender, agonized evesâtears that don't
                    disgrace his manhood much, I think.</p>
                <p>âGo now,â I whisper, huskily, âI can bear it. God bless you, darling!â</p>
                <p>âMy little Nell! My own little snowâdrop!â he cries, and then he kisses me
                    heartâbrokenly; and as he so kisses and clasps me, a great blackness comes over
                    my eyes, and I swoon away in his arms.</p>
                <p>When I come back to lifeâcome back with trouble, and sighings, and pain, I<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7039-221"/> find myself lying in my long heavy black
                    draperies on the sofa; find the candles burning low, and the fire nearly out;
                    find that he is gone, and that I am aloneâalone for evermore!</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
                <p><hi>HUGH</hi> and his mamma returned next day; the red and brown leaves were
                    whirling and dancing about, and the treeâarms were creaking and grinding.
                    Standing listlessly by my boudoir window, about four o'clock, I see the family
                    coach and the bays coming with slow majesty though the park.</p>
                <p>Hugh in his brown greatâcoat driving; our parent uprighhter than one of her own
                    knitting needles, and her <foreign xml:lang="fre">femme de chambre</foreign>
                    inside; the valet and the footman in the dickey. Here they all are! welcome,
                    welcome home! I had spent the last night, lying all along upon the earth, as
                    David did when he was interceding for the life of his little son. I was
                    interceding for the sparing of no life; I was but<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7039-223"/> interceding for the taking away of my own. The rough
                    west wind kept dashing the ivy sprays against the window pane, and I lay with my
                    face buried in the deep piled carpet, while my darling went away from me through
                    the night; went away forlornly, in his soaked pilot coat, with his dripping
                    golden hair, and his true desolate heart.</p>
                <p>As for Dolly, I had made up my mind about her. She had sown, and she was about to
                    reap; she had laboured, and she was about to enter upon the reward of her
                    labours.</p>
                <p>âNo! <emph>that</emph> she shall not! so help me God!â I cry out in my rage and
                    pain, and the dying fire gives one sleepy flicker of surprise at my vehemence. I
                    would go to Hugh, and would tell him all. I had been dishonest to him all along;
                    I would be honest now; I had been sailing under false colours; <emph>now</emph>
                    I would run up my own black pirate flag. I would go to him, and tell him all my
                    little bitter story; I would hide no detail; gloss over none of my own vast<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7039-224"/> wickedness. I would tell him how I had thrown
                    myself into that other man's arms, and begged him with tears and prayers
                    earnester than ever mother sent up in behalf of her dying child, to take me away
                    with him, to make me utterly vile and enormously happy. And I would also tell
                    himâfor to <emph>this</emph>, that other anecdote would be but the necessary
                    preface, of my sister's ingenious and newly discovered accomplishment of
                    imitating her neighbour's handwriting; an accomplishment which would have
                    twisted her graceful neck a hundred years ago.</p>
                <p>Hugh would turn me out of doors of course. I was fully prepared for that; I
                    should not think it the least severe of him. I could see the old woman sweeping
                    away her stiff lavender satin from contact with me, and looking at me with her
                    stern Puritan eyes, as the Pharisees long ago, under the blue Palestine sky,
                    looked at the woman, to whom our dear Lord Christ said, âNeither do I condemn
                    thee!â I should be turned out of doors, and should have to go about begging
                        my<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7039-225"/> my bread, in greenish rags and a
                    whine.</p>
                <p>There was almost a relief in the idea; it would be a fit expiation for my crime.
                    Moreover, what hardships, what ignominy, what painfullest, lingeringest death,
                    would not I have embraced <emph>laughing</emph>, to have baulked Dolly of the
                    pay for which she had so diligently served her master, the Devil. Cowardly,
                    chickenâhearted woman as I wasâand there were few more so between the three
                    seas,âterrifiedly as I had always shrunk from physical pain; in that first
                    frenzy of agonized hate, I would have hung all day beneath an Eastern sky,
                    nailed hand and foot to a cross, while soul and body parted slowlyâslowlyâin
                    unimagined anguish, would have been sawn asunder, stoned, burnt, readily, yea,
                    most joyfully, if thereby I could have purchased for myself the power to be
                    fitly revenged on her who had turned the jocund garden of my young life into a
                    desolate wilderness.</p>
                <p>âI will tell him toâdayâtoâmorrow.â<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7039-226"/> I say to
                    myself, as I stand drumming with my fingers on the sill, and watching my own
                    fine carriage, the carriage for which I have paid the longest price ever
                    carriage fetched, sweeping dignifiedly up to my own Hall door. Hugh helps his
                    mother out dutifullyââmy boyâ is a good sonâand then I hear him coming running
                    upstairs three steps at a time.</p>
                <p>âWell, old girl, how are you? Why did not you come down to meet us? I was looking
                    out for you at the Hall door.â</p>
                <p>âIâIâdon't know, I'm sure,â I say, feeling horribly guilty, âI never thought of
                    it.â</p>
                <p>âVery glad to get home again,â says Hugh, pulling off his dogskin gloves, and
                    precipitating himself into a minute cane armâchair; for, if you remark, men
                    always select the smallest chair they can find to deposit their persons upon. âI
                    wish my neighbours all the good in the world, but I don't seem to care how
                    little I see of them nowâaâdays.â</p>
                <p>âDon't you?â with a feeble smile.</p>
                <p>âNext time anyone invites me to his<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7039-227"/> house, I
                    think I shall say âI have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come,â eh,
                    Nellâ (I have turned a wife out of doors, and therefore I cannot come, will be a
                    more valid excuse, I think bitterly). âI say, Nell, what do you say to running
                    downstairs, and saying something civil to the old lady; I suppose it would be a
                    proper attention, wouldn't it? and old people are such sticklers for their
                    dignity.â</p>
                <p>âOh, yesâoh, to be sureâI was forgetting!â I cry, and I turn to go and greet my
                    âmother,â while Hugh follows me.</p>
                <p>We find the old dowager sitting in the library; she has not yet laid aside her
                    toga, and is reading her letters.</p>
                <p>âI hope you have had a pleasant visit,â I say, rather timidly.</p>
                <p>âCharming, my dear, charming!â (rustling her letter, and giving me a fond but
                    prickly kiss. It is a dreadful thing living in the house with two moustaches
                    nearly related to you, I find). My version of the little touching hymn to our
                    mammas, that<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7039-228"/> we all commit to memory in early
                    life would be <q>
                        <l>âWho ran to help me when I fell,</l>
                        <l>And kissed the place and <emph>stabbed</emph> it well,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-4">My mother.â</l>
                    </q> âThey always arrange their parties so nicely, no mixtures; one never runs
                    any risk there of having any of these <foreign xml:lang="fre">nouveaux
                        riches</foreign> forced willy nilly upon one; the dear Bishop, and Lord and
                    Lady Brandrethâoh, byâtheâby, Lady Brandreth asked a great deal about you, was
                    so sorry to miss the opportunity of making your acquaintance; we must positively
                    return her call next week, my dear.â</p>
                <p>âYes, certainly, if you wish.â (By next week, I shall have assumed the greenish
                    rags and the whine.)</p>
                <p>I did not tell Hugh on that day, nor on the day after, nor on the day after that.
                    Do not we all know, how without having faltered in our resolution to do a
                    disagreeable thing, we keep putting it off, from one day to another. And
                    meanwhile, the said excellent Hugh pursued the even<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7039-229"/> tenor of his way, doing his duty to God and to man,
                    according to his own ideas of what those duties were. Went to church and read
                    âBell's Lifeâ on Sundays; hunted, and drained, and liquidâmanured, and
                    steamâploughed on week days.</p>
                <p>As for the little tiffs in his seraglioâfor little tiffs there were even in those
                    early days, little tiffs there must always be, when an old woman and a young one
                    hold divided swayâas long as they were not obtruded on his notice, he treated
                    them with the sublime indifference with which Zeus, the cloud compeller, resting
                    on the topmost peak of Olympus, or going to have a snug dinner with the
                    Ethiopians, might have treated a squabble between those two arrant shrews,
                    cowâeyed Here, and grayâeyed Athene.</p>
                <p>If my eyes were red, why it was the east wind, or a touch of influenza. If I did
                    not talk, why he concluded philosophically that I had nothing to say, or at
                    least nothing to say on the subject that he was wont to delight in. For be it
                    known that Sir<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7039-230"/> Hugh was in the habit of
                    keeping a hobby horse, saddled and bridled in his mind's stable; and on this
                    docile animal he frequently cantered up and down, and took healthful exercise.
                    As often as not, this hobby horse was some pet grievance, which went to sleep
                    and underwent decent burial, as long as the hunting and training and liquid
                    manuring were in full force, but was resurrectionized whenever they were found
                    insufficient to employ all the powers of his intellect.</p>
                <p>At present the grievance was a projected railway, that was to intersect a part of
                    his property. It was to run only for about a mile and a half through one or two
                    outlying farms, and it was of no earthly disadvantage to him or his, and he knew
                    it; and yet to hear him talk, you would have imagined that it involved the ruin
                    of the whole Lancastria Gens.</p>
                <p>âIt is too bad!â he is saying now, in a quasiâinjured voice, as he sits cracking
                    walnuts at his comfortable dinner table; âone cannot call a foot of one's
                    property one's own nowâaâdays; one can never be<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7039-231"/> safe from having one's land cut up by these rascally projectors, for their
                    beastly lines that nobody wants.â</p>
                <p>âDisgraceful!â echoes the acquiescent Dowager, who like lovely Thais, sits beside
                    him, with her head unlike lovely Thais, I imagine, crowned with one of those
                    weird erections of black velvet and steel that old women delight in. âI suppose
                    it is all these dreadful Radicals; I'm sure I don't know what the country is
                    coming to; I suppose they will bring their horrid railways through one's
                    drawingâroom next.â</p>
                <p>âIt's such a confounded swindle!â pursues Hugh, applying the nutcrackers
                    viciously to a walnut as if it had been a director's head; âthe merest bubble!
                    only people are such fools; they will be taken in, try as one may to open their
                    eyes; and if they do get itâand they won't get it so easy as they think,
                        <emph>I</emph> can tell themâit will never pay them sixpence in the
                    pound.â</p>
                <p>âWon't it, dear?â say I, starting into sudden interest, for I imagined that my<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7039-232"/> husband addressed his last remark more
                    particularly to me; but I am mistaken, it is only that having finished his
                    walnuts, his eyes are gazing straight before him, and consequently, unavoidably
                    take me in in their range of vision.</p>
                <p>âDon't you remember, mother,â he goes on, after a few minutes devoted to sipping
                    claret, bringing his eyes to bear on his mamma, and thereby putting his wife off
                    guard; âdon't you remember, they were talking about this line once before, five
                    years or so ago. There was some sense in it then, because the Tadcaster and
                    Milton branch was not open then; but when that was opened it did away with all
                    need for thisâfor thatâI mean, don't you see?â</p>
                <p>He ends, for he perceives that the relative pronouns are getting too many for
                    him.</p>
                <p>âThese horrid companies get everything their own way nowâaâdays! I declare it is
                    quite shocking! it seems to me that no one can do anything for themselves in
                    these days, but must have a company to<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7039-233"/> help
                    them. We shall be having praying companies, and going to bed companies
                    soon.â</p>
                <p>Our prophetic parent ceases and adjusts her diadem, the point of which is veering
                    gently round towards her left ear.</p>
                <p>âLord â made such a capital speech in the House yesterday, upon these infernal
                    railways; shows 'em up so completely, brings 'em down to chapter and verse,
                    don't you know. <emph>I don't care what any one says</emph>,â pursues Sir Hugh,
                    looking round on his harem with a determined air, âbut I stick to it, that he is
                    the best speaker they've got now; out and out, <emph>out and out</emph>, I
                    say.â</p>
                <p>âAh!â says the senior occupant of the seraglio, deferentially, âwon't you read it
                    to us, dear Hugh? at least any part of it that you think we could understand; we
                    should like it so much, should not we, Nelly?â</p>
                <p>I again start and blush; I always am starting and blushing of late, and say very
                    nervously, âOh, yes, to be sure dearâso muchâoh do!â</p>
                <pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7039-234"/>
                <p>So we migrate to the drawingâroom, and Ariel, <foreign xml:lang="lat">alias</foreign> Tomkins, having fetched toâday's âTimes,â dear Hugh begins
                    to read through two and a half columns of statements and statistics, and
                    representations, all gilded by the lambent glow of Lord â's wit. Meanwhile
                    âmammaâ having assisted her spectacles to mount her long nose, draws her parish
                    bag towards her, and begins to clothe the naked âhear, hear'sâ and âcheers,â and
                    asks the reader is he sure he is not tired, begs him not to make himself hoarse,
                    and offers to get black currant lozenges for him.</p>
                <p>I work too, and do my best to keep my attention somewhere within a mile of those
                    big sheets; to laugh and express surprise and horror at the right places; not to
                    laugh where I ought to express horror, not to express horror where I ought to
                    laugh; and by dint of care and always taking my cue from the dowager, I succeed
                    admirably. I could not sleep that night for the wind; it kept roaring so, and
                    groaning in the great Scotch fir close to my bedâroom windows. It shook the<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7039-235"/> window frames, and came banging with impotent
                    fury against the stout stone walls.</p>
                <p><emph>That</emph> was a blowy time; many and many a coast was strewn with wrecks
                    and stranded vessels.</p>
                <p>âWhat an awful night!â my motherâinâlaw had said, as we came up the deep carpeted
                    stairs to bed, âhow thankful we ought to be, my dear, that we have no one dear
                    to us at sea.â</p>
                <p>(Oh yes, so thankful, of course.) What did it matter to us that the âEuryalusâ
                    sailed from Cork for India four days ago, with the âth Dragoons on board. God
                    help that poor ship toânight, labouring through a wintry sea, with the great
                    greenishâgray waves, with their angry white crests towering high above her
                    mastâheads! God help the one passenger that for me that ship contains! The man
                    in the drenched pilot coat, with the set white face, that day and night I see so
                    plain, that I shall see when the damps and dews of death are coming dankly down
                    upon my own.</p>
                <pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7039-236"/>
                <p>The wind lulls every now and then for a minute or two, to gather fresh strength
                    for the onset; then comes tearing, howling, shrieking like a hundred lost
                    spirits over the wintry wolds. Oh God! he'll be drowned! he'll be drowned!
                    perhaps he is drowned already! perhaps the crabs and scrawls, and noisome,
                    shapeless sea beasts are already gnawing at the heart what beat with such
                    passionate agony against mine a week ago.</p>
                <p>Towards morning the hurricane moderates, and I fall asleep heavily, and dream
                    confusedly of churchyards, and of my father as alive again, while yet I know
                    somehow all the while that he is deadâof tombs and drowned men. I sleep on late,
                    and my eyelids are purple, and my eyes look as if they had been put in with a
                    dirty finger, when I go down lateâa great crime at Wentworthâto breakfast.</p>
                <p>âI hope you have not waited; I'm so sorry!â I say apologetically, as I make my
                    tardy entrance.</p>
                <p>âI think, my dear, that it would be as well if you could try and be down for<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7039-237"/> family prayers,â says Lady Lancaster,
                    stiffly; âit is a bad example for the servants when the mistress is absent, and
                    it is no great hardship to be dressed by nine o'clock; at least it used not to
                    be considered so in my young days.â</p>
                <p>âCome, come, mother, we must not be too hard upon her,â says Hugh, taking my hand
                    fondly, âshe is not so tough as we old stagers are; and the wind kept her awake,
                    poor little woman! she is half asleep still, isn't she?â</p>
                <p>To prevent any wrangling over my unprayerful spirit, I betake myself to my
                    letters, which are lying in a little heap beside my plate. My correspondence is
                    not of much interest generally. The first that I take up has a very broad black
                    edge, ostentatiously broad, like the Pharisees' phylacteries. I look at the
                    handâwriting, frown, tear it open, and read. It does not take long reading.</p>
                <p>âMy dear Nelly,âAs you and <emph>dear</emph> Hugh, to whom I can
                        <emph>never</emph> be sufficiently grateful, have been so kind as<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7039-238"/> to offer me a home, I write to ask if you will allow
                    me to take shelter there, early next week. I trust that my coming will be no
                    annoyance to dear Lady Lancaster, but indeed I shall try hard to be in nobody's
                    way.</p>
                <p>âYour affectionate sister,</p>
                <p>âDOROTHEA LESTRANGE.â</p>
                <p>The evil day has come then; the match must be put to the train of gunpowder,
                    which is to blow the reputation of the Lestranges, and the domestic peace and
                    honour of the Lancasters into the air. Shortly after breakfast I go and knock,
                    with trembling knuckles, at the door of Hugh's snuggery, where he and his
                    bailiff hold their Witenagemotes, and transact the affairs of the Wentworth
                    nation.</p>
                <p>âMay I come in, Hugh?â</p>
                <p>âCome in! of course you may!â</p>
                <p>I enter.</p>
                <p>âWhat do you mean by knocking, Nell? have you forgotten that uncommon cold day,
                    not so long ago, when I endowed you with all my worldly goods? I did not<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7039-239"/> make any exception in favour of this sanctum,
                    did I?â</p>
                <p>âI wanted to speak to you,â I say, coming over to the table, with my eyes glued
                    to the carpet.</p>
                <p>âAll right! fire away! only come a bit closer to the fire, and don't stand there
                    looking like a little undertaker's assistant.â</p>
                <p>âI have heard from Dolly!â</p>
                <p>âOh! we shall have to have your tongue slit like a magpie's, Nell, to make you
                    talk a bit faster; she's coming, I suppose.â</p>
                <p>âShe wants to come next week.â</p>
                <p>âPoor Dolly! I'm sure I shall be very glad to see her; and I suppose you have
                    come to talk about what rooms she is to have, and that sort of thing; but you
                    had better settle all that with the old lady; she'll be fit to be tied, if she
                    is not taken into council.â</p>
                <p>I make a great plunge; it is like taking a header into a cold tub on a frosty
                    morning.</p>
                <p>âHugh!â (twisting a rosary of jet beads that I have about my neck, round my<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7039-240"/> fingers.) âWould you mind my telling her not
                    to come?â</p>
                <p>Hugh opens his brown eyes very wide, wider than ever Providence intended those
                    windows to his worthy soul to be thrown open.</p>
                <p>âTell her not to come! after having offered her a home, to slink out of it; leave
                    her, poor girl, without a roof to shelter her pretty head in! why, Nell, you
                    must be joking!â</p>
                <p>âJoking!â I cry, passionately; âif you knew all, you would not think it a joking
                    matter. I cannot <emph>breathe</emph> in the same house with her!â</p>
                <p>Hugh comes over, and pulls me down on the sofa beside him. âYou must have a slate
                    off this morning, Nell! wind blew it off last night! Ha! Ha! cannot breathe in
                    the same house with your only sister! such a big house too; you
                        <emph>must</emph> require a deal of fresh air! you have been squabbling by
                    post, I suppose!â</p>
                <p>âIt's no case of squabbling!â I say, very earnestly, while I feel my white cheeks
                    getting crimson; âoh, Hugh, I<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7039-241"/> have something
                    to tell youâsomething I <emph>must</emph> tell youâoh, I wish it was not so
                    hard!â</p>
                <p>âIf it is anything about Dolly; anything she has done wrong, or any scrape she
                    has got into, I don't seem to care about hearing about it!â says Hugh. âI
                    daresay she'd sooner I didn't, you know, and there is no use crying over spilt
                    milk.â</p>
                <p>âIt's about myself, too!â I say, in great agitation.</p>
                <p>Hugh puts his kind arm round me, and looks with incredulous amused eyes at my
                    half averted face. âSome dreadful crime you have been committing, eh? not said
                    âAmenâ loud enough in church, or pitched into Bentham, for giving your back hair
                    a tug?â</p>
                <p>His utter unsuspiciousness stabs me.</p>
                <p>âOh, don't, don't laugh!â I cry, piteously; âyou wouldn't if you knew.â</p>
                <p>There is nothing on earth that Hugh hates so much as a scene, and he fears that
                    one is imminent. âI've got something to tell you too,â he says, cheerily, rising
                    and walking towards his escritoire;<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7039-242"/> âand as
                    mine seems to be the pleasantest piece of news, I'll have it out first;
                        <emph>yours</emph> will keep, I'm sure!â</p>
                <p>I remain sitting on the sofa where he left me, twisting my hands about, and
                    wishing, oh how heartily! that this confession, of the gravity of which my
                    husband is so utterly unsuspecting, were well over, and I turned out of doors
                    once for all. Presently he comes back with a small red leather case in his hand,
                    and sits down again beside me.</p>
                <p>âDo you remember, Nell,â he says, composing his jolly face to a decent gravity,
                    befitting, as he thinks the subject; âdo you remember telling me once that you
                    had nothing but a photograph ofâofâyour poor father?â</p>
                <p>âYes,â I say, wincing; âdon't talk about him!â (nobody ever mentions his name to
                    me now, I cannot bear it.)</p>
                <p>âI won't, I won't!â says Hugh apologetically; ânot more than I can help at least,
                    but I have had this done for you, and I want you to take one look at it, if you
                    don't mind.â</p>
                <pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7039-243"/>
                <p>He unfastens the case, takes out a large gold locket, with the monogram A.L. in
                    diamonds upon it, and after fumbling a little about the spring, opens it with
                    his big, kind, clumsy fingers.</p>
                <p>I look half reluctant, and in an instant the tears come rushing to my eves. I see
                    again the kind blue eyes; the humorous tender smile that the coffin lid hid away
                    from me six dreary weeks ago; it is my old man come to life again, only that hat
                    the artist has painted out half the weary care lines; my old man, as he was
                    before his troubles, came upon him; as he will beâoh, no! he will look yet
                    nobler and beautifuller, and peacefuller thenâwhen he comes to meet me at the
                    golden gates.</p>
                <p>I throw my arms round Hugh's neck; it is the first time that I ever kissed him
                    voluntarily in my life. Poor Hugh! my emotion is hardly of the pleasurable kind
                    that he had hoped and intended. He looks uneasily concerned, and I see his mouth
                    forming itself into his favourite whistling shape.</p>
                <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7039-244"/>
                <p>âI did not mean to upset you like this, Nell!â he says, byâandâby.</p>
                <p>âOh, you are so good to me!â I cry, incoherently; âand I'm not at all good to
                    you! Oh, I do so wish that I liked you better! I do so wish that I had always
                    liked you!â</p>
                <p>Hugh pats my hair very fondly.</p>
                <p>âMy dear old woman!â he says, âlet bygones be bygones! don't let, us rake up any
                    old grievances; it don't make much odds if you hated me like poison once, so as
                    you don't hate me now!â</p>
                <p>We sit silent for a few minutes. Hugh whistles âPolly Perkinsâ very softly to
                    himself, while doubt and vacillation enter my mind.</p>
                <p>My husband's words keep ringing in my ears. âLet bygones be bygones!â Is he
                    right? Would not it be better to âlet the dead past bury its dead?â Have I not
                    done him enough injury already, coming to him so meanly, taking all his love and
                    his kind words and caresses, and giving him nothing in return but sour looks and
                    peevish tears, and dimmed<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7039-245"/> beauty; without
                    lacerating that honest heart unnecessarily, by telling him that his wife is
                    unfaithful to him; if not in deed, at least in heart and thought.</p>
                <p>The temptation is gone, never to return; why not let that secret remain between
                    God and my own heart? But if I abandon my confession, I must also abandon my
                    revenge; the one involves the other.</p>
                <p>âI often think,â says Hugh, with more gravity than is his wont, âthat one great
                    cause of there being so much unhappiness in married life is people's expecting
                    too much of one another, I don't want us to split on that rock, Nell. I should
                    like you to look a bit happier certainly byâandâby; and to seem a bit gladder to
                    see me, when I come to speak to you, if you can; but if not, why we must rub on
                    as we are, and I'm very thankful to Providence for having given you to me at
                    all!â</p>
                <p>âProvidence made you but a shabby present!â I say, with contrition.</p>
                <p>âNot much to brag of, I daresay;â<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7039-246"/> says Hugh
                    playfully, pulling my ear, âbut you see I am easily pleased. Well, I must be
                    going out; I cannot stop mollyâcoddling away half a morning at a foolish little
                    woman's apron strings; and I say, Nell, you go and talk to the old lady about
                    Dolly, and drop the poor girl a line to tell her we shall be very glad to see
                    her any day she likes to come; and don't let me hear any more nonsense about
                    envy, hatred and malice and all uncharitableness!â</p>
                <p>âBut I <emph>do</emph> hate her! I have every reason to hate her! Hugh! Hugh!â I
                    call after him eagerly, but he has beaten a hasty retreat, to avoid further
                    discussion of the subject.</p>

                <p>â<hi>VENGEANCE</hi> is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord!â Of all the texts of
                    scripture, that is the one that kept saying itself over and over again to my
                    heart, as I sat that morning listening in respectful silence, while Lady
                    Lancaster went on purring about Lady Brandreth's crochet needles, and the fleecy
                    wool she had to send to Glasgow forâcould not get it in England, my dear, tried
                    every shop in Regent Street.</p>
                <p>Do you know that after all my blustering and threats and big resolutions, I am
                    beginning to think that I must leave that said vengeance in the hands of Him to
                    whom it appertains; that I must not meddle with the attributes of the
                    Omnipotent. I have cooled down from my<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7039-248"/> first
                    fever of indignant hate. I am not the stuff of which Jaels are made. My fingers
                    would have trembled so that I could never have hammered the nail into my
                    prostrate enemy's tired brows. I should have fallen to pitying him; lying there
                    so weary, so helpless, so trustful. I am beginning to doubt whether I will bring
                    the last of the old nameâname for ever hallowed by my father's having worn it,
                    to disgrace and shame, whether despite all her misdoings, I will turn her out
                    adrift and homeless on the world.</p>
                <p>I am beginning to see my own sins very clearly, and not only other people's. Will
                    not Dolly's tormenting presence in my house, the sound of her silky voice, the
                    sight of her subtle beauty triumphing over the ruins of my life, be a fit
                    penance for my own wickedness? Can any expiation be too hard, too bitter, for
                    the woman who fell so low, as to ask another man to run away with her from her
                    husband? who was only saved from utter shipwreck by the untainted nobility of
                    soul, the <choice>

                    lover himself.</p>
                <p>âYour sister Dorothea had a charming crochet <foreign xml:lang="fre">tricoter</foreign>, pattern, when last she was here, my dear, she seemed a
                    beautiful worker, quite different from you, Nell; byâtheâby, I am afraid that
                    the hunting season will be over before poor dear Hugh's waistcoat is finished;
                    she will be a great assistance to me, I fancy, when she comes to us next week.
                    Did she say what day we were to expect her, my dear?â</p>
                <p>âNo.â</p>
                <p>âHave you written to her, my love? because if not, had not you better go and do
                    so immediately?â</p>
                <p>âThere's plenty of time,â I say indolently, âit is not near post hour.â</p>
                <p>âThere is never any use in procrastination, my dear, as my dear mother used often
                    to say to me, when I was your age, and besides, I shall want you to come and pay
                    a few calls with me this afternoon. You really must try and exert yourself a
                    little more than you do, Nell; there is <choice>

                <p>So I retire and write a little icy note to my sister; telling her that my husband
                    bids me say she is welcome to come any day she chooses, and that I am <choice>
                        <corr>hers</corr>

                    </choice> sincerely, Eleanor Lancaster.</p>
                <p>The day of Dolly's advent comes, and the carriage is sent to the station for her.
                    Hugh had suggested to me, to go to meet her in it; an honour which I steadfastly
                    persist in declining. Lady Lancaster is writing letters in her own room, almost
                    effacing with her long old nose the characters that she forms with her fingers.
                    I am buried in an armâchair in my boudoir, reading a novel. It interests me
                    rather, for it is all about a married woman, who ran away from her husband and
                    suffered the extremity of human ills in consequence. I have made several steps
                    in morality of late I flatter myself, but even now, I can hardly imagine that I
                    should have been very miserable if Dick had taken me away with him.</p>
                <p>The naughty matron is just dying of a broken heart and starvation in a <choice>

                    </choice><pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7039-251"/> tentiary, when I hear carriage
                    wheels. Postponing the last dying speech and confession of the faded flower, I
                    jump up, run to the window, and peep behind the blinds. I am in time to see
                    Dolly descend gracefullyâmy sister can get in and out of a carriage with any
                    woman in England, not so easy an accomplishment as one might thinkâand hold out
                    two little black hands effusively to Hugh.</p>
                <p>Dolly gives one an impression of extreme blackness altogether. âPoor dear Papaâ
                    is written all over her, in best paramatta and deepest crape. Even the slender
                    shapely legs that I caught a glimpse of a minute ago on the carriage step, look
                    as if they belonged unmistakeably to a mourner.</p>
                <p>âNell! Nell!â shouts my domestic Stentor, but I respond not. Then I hear my
                    husband's and sister's voices approaching me.</p>
                <p>âShe's not here, I'm sure,â Hugh is saying, âor she would have answered when I
                    called; she always does; she's out, I'm afraid.â He opens the boudoir door. âShe
                    is here after all; why, old woman, what has<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7039-252"/>
                    become of your manners? come and say how do you do to Dolly?â</p>
                <p>Dolly is advancing rapidly to precipitate herself on my neck, but something in my
                    face keeps her back, and alters her intention.</p>
                <p>âHow do you do?â I say very coldly, not even holding out my hand to her.</p>
                <p>Hugh looks from one to the other puzzled and uncomfortable.</p>
                <p>âWell, I suppose you two have got a hundred and one things to say to one another,
                    and would only be wishing me at the other end of nowhere if I were to stop, so
                    I'll make myself scarce,â he says cheerfully, and then he goes out, and shuts
                    the door behind him.</p>
                <p>We stand opposite each other like two fighting cocks for a minute or so; then
                    Dolly sinks into a chair.</p>
                <p>âAs you don't appear to intend to invite me to take a seat, I suppose I must
                    invite myself,â she says, smiling; âyou certainly have the <foreign xml:lang="fre">maniÃ¨re prÃ©venante</foreign>, Nell, which is becoming so
                    rapidly extinct.â</p>
                <p>âI have; have I?â</p>
                <pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7039-253"/>
                <p>âYou know how to welcome the coming, and I should imagine also how to speed the
                    parting guest.â</p>
                <p>âI do, do I?â</p>
                <p>The delicate carnation is deepening in my sister's cheeks; those cheeks that look
                    smoother and clearer than ever in their crape setting.</p>
                <p>âI hardly know how to break the news to you, but I'm afraid I shall not be able
                    to trespass on your hospitality long.â</p>
                <p>âHm! are you going to betake yourself to a better world?â I ask ironically; âyou
                    certainly are too good for this.â</p>
                <p>âI'm going to make a home for myself!â says my sister, with calm triumph; âI am
                    going to marry Lord Stockport.â</p>
                <p>I stand for a moment dumbâfoundered, aghast. Where, where is my storyâbook code
                    of morality? Where is the whipping for the naughty boy? Here is a young woman
                    who has told lies, has forged, has wrecked the happiness of her sister's whole
                    life, and she is punished; how?âwhy by marrying a lord with Â£80,000<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7039-254"/> a year. Truly poetic justice is confined to poetry
                    indeed; and comes down never to the prose dealings of every day life.</p>
                <p>âLord Stockport!â I ejaculate, âhappy man!â</p>
                <p>An angry scintillation flashes from Dolly's superb black eyes.</p>
                <p>âHe is to be pitied, isn't he, poor man? his wife cannot bring him the ample
                    stock of affection and fidelity that Sir Hugh Lancaster's did him! Of course
                    not! that goes without saying.â</p>
                <p>âShe can bring him a large stock of accomplishments though!â I say quickly,
                    breathing short and hard.</p>
                <p>Miss Lestrange looks as if she did not exactly see the drift of this observation;
                    she says â<foreign xml:lang="fre">AprÃ¨s</foreign>?â interrogatively.</p>
                <p>âLady Stockport's list of talents will be longer than Desdemona's even;â I say
                    very bitterly. âSo delicate with her needle! an admirable musician!âoh, she
                    would sing the savageness out of a bearâof so high and plenteous a wit and
                        inventionâ<emph>and can imitate her neighbour's handwriting so
                        excellently</emph>.â</p>
                <pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7039-255"/>
                <p>Dolly gives a start, a perceptible start, but recovers herself immediately.</p>
                <p>âWhat do you mean?â she asks quietly; âyou ought to be published with a key or a
                    commentary!â But I see her fingers tightening their hold upon the back of her
                    chair.</p>
                <p>I go over to my writing table, and take out a letter. âThis is what I mean!â I
                    say, very slowly, holding it up before her; âI am sure Lord Stockport will prize
                    the gift of your hand all the more, when he sees how clever it is! I intend to
                    keep this to show him!â</p>
                <p>The carmine retires rather rapidly from my sister's cheeks, and from her full
                    lips also as she scans the document.</p>
                <p>âAre you quite so sure that you will be Lady Stockport now?â I ask very
                    softly.</p>
                <p>We are silent a minute; then Dolly says very sharplyânone of the old sweetness in
                    her tone, âHow did you get this? you must have been seeing that man again?â</p>
                <p>It is not a bad idea carrying the war into the enemies' quarters, is it?</p>
                <p>âIt is not much matter to you how I got<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7039-256"/> it; it
                    is enough for you to know that I have got it.â</p>
                <p>âOf course! of course! only it is a pity that any detail should be wanting to
                    complete such a pretty story.â</p>
                <p>âIt will be quite complete enough for Lord Stockport, I daresay!â I say very
                    drily.</p>
                <p>âAnd for Hugh?â asks Dolly, with a little vicious smile.</p>
                <p>âWe will be impartial!â I say coldly, âthey shall both hear it.â</p>
                <p>Dolly laughs softly, and the colour comes back with a deeper, fuller rush to her
                    face. âResurrection of Daddy Longâlegs! a tragedy in two acts,â she says
                    derisively. If I have expected to overwhelm my sister with the damning proofs of
                    her guilt, I am disappointed. As the petrel is popularly supposed to rejoice in
                    the storm, so Dolly appears almost to riot in the war of the moral elements; âto
                    be put on the boards of the Wentworth theatre, what day, Nell? let us be
                    exact!â</p>
                <p>âToâday!â I cry, raising my voice, my hard kept composure giving way, and<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7039-257"/> merging into honest passionate anger, âthere
                    is never any use in delaying the exposure of crime.â</p>
                <p>âImpossible, my dear!â says my sister, with a shrug, âone of the principal actors
                    will be absent. Stockport does not come till Saturday!â</p>
                <p>âPoor man!â I say compassionately, âit will be a pleasant surprise for him
                    discovering that his wife is a <emph>forger</emph>.â Dolly subsides into
                    gravity.</p>
                <p>âI never objected to people calling a spade a spade; I suppose I am a forger; but
                    to my thinking, the end justifies the means, and has done so in this case; there
                    is one commandment I am sorry for having broken, and only one!â</p>
                <p>âWhich?â</p>
                <p>âThe eleventh, peculiarly appropriated to woman's use. âThou shall not be found
                    out!ââ replies Dolly with composure.</p>
                <p>âUnfortunately you <emph>have</emph> broken it!â I say, struggling to emulate her
                    calmness, âand now you must pay the penalty!â</p>
                <p>âDon't let us have any threatening, it<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7039-258"/> is not
                    ladyâlike; let us be ladyâlike whatever we are!â says Dolly, standing up, and
                    sweeping gracefully over towards the door. âHave me up for forgery if you
                    likeââScandal in high life;â it would make the fortune of the Nantford
                    Advertiser; drag the old name through the dirt; it will annoy you far more than
                    it will me, to tell you the truth. I have never been very much in love with
                    either Stockport or respectability, so that the loss of neither will
                        <emph>quite</emph> break my heart.â</p>
                <p>A knock at the door.</p>
                <p>âMay I come in?â in an old croaky voice, and without waiting for permission, a
                    long reddish nose, a pair of goldârimmed spectacles and a beard make their
                    appearance.</p>
                <p>We both look rather foolish, like little naughty boys whose pockets have been
                    found bulging with the illicit marble, or the succulent bull'sâeye in church.
                    Simultaneously, we vault off our high horses.</p>
                <p>âI am afraid, I'm interrupting a pleasant tÃªteâÃ âtÃªte!â says the old lady,
                    pokerishly, âbut I heard your voice, my<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7039-259"/> dear
                    Dorothea, and I thought I must come in and just say how d'ye do to you. Are not
                    you very tired after your journey, my dear child? those cross lines are so
                    fatiguing; so many changes, and having to look after your own luggage too. I
                    suppose it is an old fashioned notion on my part, but I never can reconcile
                    myself to the idea of young people travelling alone. So many unpleasant <foreign xml:lang="fre">contretemps</foreign> have occurred of late, too; no
                    communication between the carriages, and since that dreadful affair of Mr.
                    Briggs too!â</p>
                <p>âYou did not interrupt us at all, dear Lady Lancaster,â says Dolly, whom the old
                    woman's babble has given time to recover her <emph>aplomb</emph>; âwe had nearly
                    finished our chat, hadn't we, Nell?â</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> is the twentieth day of February, in the year of our Lord 186â. The
                    violets, like Noah's dove, are poking their noses out of doors, to see what sort
                    of weather it is. They are beginning to quit their wintry lodgment. <q>
                        <l rend="ti-2">âWhere they together</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">All the hard weather</l>
                        <l>Dead to the world, keep house unknown.â</l>
                    </q> White onesâplenty of themâare peeping out modestly, from among freshest
                    green leaves, on the sunny south side of Lestrange churchyard, above the prone
                    heads of the human flowers, to whom the spring time of Resurrection is long in
                    coming. Sir Adrian Lestrange loved them so dearly; every spring he used to come
                        with<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7039-261"/> his little daughter Nell to look for
                    them, and smile his friendly welcome to them and the celandines that carpet
                    goldenly the space beneath the old blackâbudded ashes.</p>
                <p>Sir Adrian does not come this spring; he is âawayâ good man! He has travelled to
                    a land where there are better flowers than his pretty violets, and where he and
                    his little Nell can walk about together in peace, without any âcloaked shadowâ
                    coming between to part them, as they have been parted for just a little spaceâa
                    little bitter minuteâhere below.</p>
                <p>The celandines are spreading their gaudy carpet also beneath the elms and
                    sycamores in Sir Hugh Lancaster's garden at Wentworth. They are flaring and
                    flaunting away with such confident pertness; just for all the world as if they
                    were real garden flowers, and did not deserve to be extirpated every bit as much
                    as the poor daisies that were always being ruthlessly spudded up.</p>
                <p>The first breath of spring is blowing about the land; she is raising herself a<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7039-262"/> little out of winter's snowy lap, waking up
                    and rubbing her fair eyes. I have been late for prayers again, and have received
                    a mild jobation in consequence.</p>
                <p>Breakfast is over now, and Lady Lancaster and I are standing at the Hall door,
                    watching our Hugh mount his hack to ride to a rather distant meet. Hugh looks
                    his best acock horse; one does not see how short he is, and he has the best seat
                    in âshire.</p>
                <p>âHow well Hugh looks on horseback!â exclaims the Dowager, never weary of admiring
                    her son, though the spectacle is anything but a novel one to her.</p>
                <p>âHe does not look amiss in pink,â I respond, less rapturously, but still with
                    commendation in my tone; for to give myself my due, I am growing to love Hugh
                    with all love <q>
                        <l>ââââ except the love</l>
                        <l>Of man and woman, when they love their best</l>
                        <l>Closest and sweetestââââ</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>The last vestige of my lord's red coat having disappeared round a bend in the<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7039-263"/> drive, I turn away and stroll up and down the
                    terrace by myself. The sun is getting a little power; he beats quite warmly on
                    my uncovered head, and I saunter and potter about slowly, and watch the
                    crocuses, yellow, and purple, and striped forcing their way up through the rich
                    red earth. A small fat cock robin is sitting on the stone balustrades, singing
                    his little heart out. I stand pensively listening to him.</p>
                <p>âI wish I was as happy as you!â I say to myself; âI do indeed! it would be so
                    pleasant!â</p>
                <p>There is a little sound of pebbles being swept along, and looking up, I see Dolly
                    coming along to meet me; Dolly in a tight fitting black dress, which shows every
                    curve and turn of her exquisite figure, and relieved about neck and wrists by
                    the nattiest of white linen collar and cuffs. It is not every one that can blend
                    the afflictive and the becoming as our Dolly can. Dolly looks lovelier in the
                    early morning, in her every day gown, than when dressed, or<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7039-264"/> undressedâas the <foreign xml:lang="fre">mode</foreign> now has itâfor ball or opera.</p>
                <p>âDelicious morning, isn't it?â says my sister stopping beside me, and sniffing
                    the sweet fresh air, with her little Greek nose.</p>
                <p>âYes.â</p>
                <p>âWhat a pretty place it is!â surveying admiringly the wide formal gardens, where
                    terraces, gravel walks, Deodaras, urns recur with almost as tedious a monotony
                    as the knops and flowers in the Tabernacle decorations.</p>
                <p>âNot particularly, I don't think!â</p>
                <p>âIf people only knew what was for their own good!â with a gentle sigh, âyou ought
                    to be a very happy woman, Nell!â</p>
                <p>âYou have done your best to make me so, at all events!â</p>
                <p>âI did evil that good might come, as I told you yesterday, when that exemplary
                    old tabby interrupted usâbyâtheâby I hope she had not been eavesâdroppingâand
                    good <emph>has</emph> come,â says Dolly steadily; âapropos of that, I have <choice>
                        <orig>someâ</orig>
                        <reg>something</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7039-265"/> thing to tell you; Stockport comes
                    toâday.â</p>
                <p>âWell?â</p>
                <p>âOh nothing particular, of course; only I thought I had better tell you, so that
                    you might have your weapon ready to stab the poor soul with, as soon as he
                    arrives.â</p>
                <p>Dolly is not agitated, she never is; âwise men never wonder,â and âwith the
                    wisdom of the children of this worldâ none can deny that Dorothea is dowered.
                    Perhaps it is my fancy that there is rather an anxious light in the great dreamy
                    sensuous eyes, that the flush on the oval cheeks is deeper than what the soft
                    south wind has brought there.</p>
                <p>âThanks,â I say, very coldly; and then I go and lean my arms on the
                    balustradeâour talking has scared away the robinâand look wistfully off over the
                    landscape, winking in the morning sun, to the East, whither my heart has gone.
                    One would have thought, wouldn't one, that Dolly having told her errand, would
                    straightway have returned again<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7039-266"/> whence she
                    came, but such does not seem to be her intention. She comes, on the contrary,
                    and leans on the rough cold stone beside me.</p>
                <p>âLet us understand one another, Nell,â she says, with some slight hesitation,
                    âare you <emph>really</emph> bent on exhibiting that unlucky document, or is it
                    only a <emph>bogy</emph> that you are keeping to frighten me into good behaviour
                    with?â</p>
                <p>âI thought we had understood each other perfectly the other night, and that there
                    was no need for fresh explanations,â I say icily, âI imagined that I had made my
                    meaning tolerably clear then.â</p>
                <p>âAnd about yourself?â she says quickly; âhave you considered what awkward
                    inquiries it will entail, inquiries too from a person who has the best right in
                    the world to make them, and who cannot be put off, as you have put off me with,
                    âit is enough for you that I <emph>have</emph> got it.â Hugh must be more or
                    less than human if he is not a little curious to know how you came by it. Lords

                    isn't it?â</p>
                <p>I turn round and face her.</p>
                <p>âDo you think,â I say eagerly, âthat if it entailed the loss of my life, I should
                    very much care; thanks to you, I may say, with Agag âsurely the bitterness of
                    death is past.ââ</p>
                <p>Dolly looks down and draws geometrical patterns with her slender pointed
                    foot.</p>
                <p>âI know you <choice>
                        <corr>won't</corr>
                        <sic>wont</sic>
                    </choice> believe me, so it's rather wasting breath asseverating,â she says
                    slowly, âbut I give you my word of honour I did it for the best; I thought that
                    it was a childish besotment you had for that man; a sort of calf love, that it
                    would be a real kindness to help you out of.â</p>
                <p>âWithout an <foreign xml:lang="fre">arriÃ¨re pensÃ©e</foreign> for your own
                    advantage of course; it would have been truer kindness to have cut my throat for
                    my own good!â I end passionately. My voice shakes and wavers in my intense
                    selfâpity; I am afraid of breaking down into weeping before her, into
                        âhowling,â<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7039-268"/> âblubbering,â âsnivelling,â as
                    she in her dryâeyed contemptuousness would graphically phrase it; so I rush
                    away, away to the house, and up to my chamber, like Joseph, to weep there. For
                    an hour or more I sit with my two hands holding my head, buried in thought. Woe
                    is me if my mammaâinâlaw catches me; small opinion has she of thought as an
                    employment for the female sex, and then I rise, unlock the drawer of my writing
                    table, take out the âunlucky document,â as its parent leniently calls it, and go
                    downstairs with it.</p>
                <p>I find Dolly sitting by the library fire, her small white left hand on which Lord
                    Stockport's great diamond betrothal ring is flashing and sparkling in the
                    firelightâbitter, bitter will be the parting between Dolly and that jewel of
                    priceâis pushed in amongst the black wealth of her scented hair; she is staring
                    with her great dark velvet eyes at the shining bars; her cheeks and small round
                    ears are getting burnt a dull red, but she does not seem to heed that. I go up
                    close to her, and stoop over her.</p>
                <pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7039-269"/>
                <p>âDolly!â I say with solemnity, âI have thought a great deal about my revenge upon
                    you; I have lain awake at night planning it; it has seemed meat and drink to me
                    for the last week. I have finished planning it out now, look!â</p>
                <p>As I speak I toss the letter into the fire's innermost heart, and watch the
                    flames catch hold of it, and then shoot up high; watch it turn brown; then
                    writhe like a thing in pain; then shrivel away utterly. Dolly jumps up and
                    throws her arms about my neck.</p>
                <p>âDon't,â I say, gently disengaging myself; âkeep your blandishments for the lover
                    you have <emph>saved</emph>; I think he would appreciate them more.â</p>
                <p>So you see I gave up my revenge; I did not carry the stone in my pocket for seven
                    years; then turn it, and carry it for seven years more. I yielded up my injuries
                    unto Him, who claims the redressing of all the injustices that have been wrought
                    since the world was. I had been clamouring for justice, bare justice. Alas, if
                    bare justice is all I myself get, in that<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7039-270"/> day

                <p>âA very worthy young man, my dear, I don't doubt,â says Lady Lancaster to me, a
                    morning or two afterwards, <foreign xml:lang="fre">apropos</foreign> of my
                    brotherâinâlaw elect, as we sit pecketting at our work in the morning
                    roomâHugh's waistcoat is making rapid strides towards completionâlooking at me
                    over the top of her spectacles, âvery worthy, indeed! does not seem to have very
                    much to say for himself perhaps, but that is a fault on the right side in these
                    days, when all young people seem to think that they cannot have too much of the
                    sound of their own voices!â</p>
                <p>âHe is rather silent!â I say, which is certainly putting it in a very mild form,
                    seeing that I could count with ease on the fingers of one hand the remarks he
                    has made since he entered our hospitable portals.</p>
                <pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7039-271"/>
                <p>âDear me!â pursues the old lady, wandering off into reminiscences, âhow well I
                    remember his grandfather's shop to be sure! He was a hosier, you know, my dear,
                    in Bond Street, a very civil old man with a bald head, I recollectâthis young
                    man has a look of him now and thenâhe used to come out to one's carriage door to
                    take orders, and that sort of thing, my dear!â</p>
                <p>âIt is a very upâpy and downây world!â I say sententiously.</p>
                <p>âIf he had told me then,â continues my companion, making her speech more emphatic
                    by uplifted and outâspread right hand, âthat forty years from that time, my son
                    and his grandson would be marrying two sisters, I should have withdrawn my
                    custom from his shop for his impertinence.â</p>
                <p>I laugh.</p>
                <p>âIt is a rise, whose suddenness is only paralleled by Dick Whittington's and his
                    cat; in fact, it beats them, for Dick was only Lord Mayor after all, and
                    Stockport is Lord, without the Mayor!â</p>
                <pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7039-272"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, the âworthy young manâ and Dolly are strolling up and down the
                    terrace. Dolly seems to like to keep within view of the windows. I fancy that
                    the young Viscount's amenities become ponderous, when freed from the restraint
                    of the public eye.</p>
                <p>So Dolly is to be wed; she is to be made a Viscountess of; to be elevated to a
                    throne among the Gods. King Cophetna has given his hand to the Beggar Maid, and
                    she is tripping daintily up to seat herself beside that august and condescending
                    monarch.</p>
                <p>But when is it to be? When are the festive poles to be run up, and the âhealths
                    to the houses of Stockport and Lestrangeâ to float in the breeze?</p>
                <p>At first, Dolly stoutly maintained that no earthly power should induce her to
                    allow her marriage to be celebrated till a full year had elapsed, since âpoor
                    dear Papa'sâ death.</p>
                <p>âO, impossible! quite out of the question! so disrespectful to his memory! Did he
                    suppose she had no natural affection?<corr>â</corr><pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7039-273"/> &amp;c., &amp;c. When first the subject was
                    hinted, she retreated from the room with her handkerchief to her eyes; not
                    angry, but so <emph>hurt</emph>.</p>
                <p>This I hear from Hugh.</p>
                <p>âCompletely upset, poor girl!â he says, pulling his thick moustache, and staring
                    at his boots, which are stuck out straight before him; âso Stockport tells me.
                    He thought he had put his foot into it with a vengeance, and that she was not
                    going to speak to him again for a month of Sundays.â</p>
                <p>The text about polishing the sepulchres of the Righteous occurs to me, but I keep
                    it to myself.</p>
                <p>âIf ever I have any daughters,â says HughâI look downââI hope they'll be as fond
                    of me as you two were of <emph>him</emph>.â</p>
                <p>(<emph>You two</emph>! classing us together! My God! that is hard to bear!)</p>
                <p>âI'm sure I wish she would marry him, and have done with it,â continues Hugh,
                    yawning. âGreat Sawney! I'm getting dogâtired of seeing his ugly mug about the
                    house; seems to be in every room at once<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7039-274"/> too,
                    like a bird; he's a thundering lout, that's what he is!â</p>
                <p>âIf you <emph>will</emph> be so Quixotically generous as to bring all your wife's
                    relations, like a hornet's nest, about your ears, you must take the
                    consequences,â I say, a little maliciously.</p>
                <p>Time does wonders, and time and Lord Stockport succeeded in softening our Dolly's
                    tender scruples.</p>
                <p>âOne cannot always consult one's own feelings in this world,â I overheard her
                    saying one day to Hugh, âelse, (with a gentle sigh) things would be very
                    different, but for poor Stockport's sakeâhe really is getting so miserably
                    unsettled and fretfulâah, I know some one who can feel for him; some one who was
                    not <emph>too</emph> patient himself once, a hundred years agoâthat I am afraid
                    it will tell upon his health; <emph>that</emph> would not be fair, would it? and
                    soââ(with down dropped eyes and a blush.) And so a judicious compromise has been
                    effected between the bridegroom's eagerness, and the bride's filial devotion. He
                    had clamoured<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7039-275"/> for April, and she had stickled
                    for December. June is a happy mean between the two, and June it is to be.</p>
                <p>I had begged that the wedding might be a very quiet one; the idea of a great
                    gathering, of all the onerous duties of mistress of a great house coming upon me
                    for the first time, of feasting and merry making in the midst of my deep
                    mourning was utterly repellant to me. But I am overruled by my mamma, as I have
                    been on many other occasions.</p>
                <p>âLife is too short to be spent in vain repinings, my dear,â she says to me one
                    morning, after we have been indulging in a mild wrangle on the subject; âthere
                    are duties owing to the living as well as to the dead, and we should not
                    selfishly neglect the former for the latter.â</p>
                <p>I make no answer, but bend my head in silence over my work. âIt seems to me,â
                    pursues the old lady, rather exasperated by my silence, âthat there is something
                        <emph>unchristian</emph> in such exaggerated grief; it is a sure argument of
                    an illâregulated mind; you seem to forget that there is such a<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7039-276"/> virtue as Resignation, one of the most beautiful of
                    Christian graces, or that our Heavenly Father knows what is best for us!â Lady
                    Lancaster has none of her son's shyness in mentioning the Deity. On the
                    contrary, her Heavenly Father plays a large part in her conversation,
                    particularly when she is angry.</p>
                <p>âIt's very easy to be resigned to one's Heavenly Father, when he does nothing to
                    vex one,â I cry passionately, ignoring the fifth commandment, or perhaps
                    imagining that it does not apply to parentsâinâlaw. The Dowager rises very
                    stiffly, and makes her flat back flatter than ever.</p>
                <p>âIf you are going to be blasphemous, my dear,â she says âI have nothing more to
                    say; we must drop the subject, if you please!â and she sweeps out of the room
                    with dignity. Dropping the subject means that I apologize, and that the old lady
                    gets her own way. And so March, and April, and Mayâblowiest, tearfullest and
                    sweetest of the daughters of the yearâsteal past us; march quickly<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7039-277"/> by to join the other dead months and years; go over
                    to the majority as the Romans have it. And there comes a sultry day in early
                    Juneâday when my sister's life began to open, and mine, I think, to close.</p>
                <p>ââHappy the bride that the sun shines on,â the proverb says, doesn't it?â asks
                    Hugh that morning, lying staring lazily out of window at the pale blue sky, and
                    the Scotch firs, and the rooks cawing and flapping about their windy homes; âif
                    that's the case, I'm afraid you have not a chance of coming in for much luck,
                    have you, Nell? You had not a ha'porth of sun from âDearly Beloved,â to
                    âAmazement.ââ</p>
                <p>I am up and dressed already.</p>
                <p>âProverbs often tell lies,â I say carelessly. âHonesty is the best policy; It is
                    better to be good than pretty; Early birds pick the worm; what can be greater
                    fiction than those three?â</p>
                <p>âWe shall have the house to ourselves to night, Nell!â says Hugh cheerfully,
                    âthat'll be a comfort, won't it?â</p>
                <pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7039-278"/>
                <p>âYeâes,â I say rather doubtfully, âat least do you know, Hugh, I sometimes wish
                    that somebody would take it into their head to marry your mother; some
                    meekâminded old gentleman that she could rule with a rod of iron, and make
                    muffetees for, and read âA Voice from the Pit,â or âA few plain words about
                    sinners,â to.â</p>
                <p>Hugh bursts out into a loud haw! haw!</p>
                <p>âOh! I say, Nell! too bad! what's the Mater been doing now? slanging you, or
                    giving you good little books to read?â</p>
                <p>âA little of both, perhaps!â I say, laughing.</p>
                <p>Wentworth Church is a mile from Wentworth House; just outside the park it stands;
                    ugly, squareâwindowed, ivyâless. Sir Hugh's work people and tenants have been as
                    zealous in doing honour to his sisterâinâlaw, as if she were a real Lancaster.
                    There is a big arch at the first gate; a bigger at the second, and a biggest at
                    the church gate.</p>
                <pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7039-279"/>
                <p>June has such a wealth of roses that she can spare a good many to scatter under
                    Dolly's feet, without missing them. The deer raise their slender smoky heads to
                    look surprisedly at these monstrosities that have sprung up like mushrooms after
                    rain, and then go leaping lightly away through the deep bracken.</p>
                <p>The churchyard is full of people; there is quite a struggle for the vantage
                    ground of the high flat tombstones, that give one always an idea of grim ghastly
                    boxes. The children have had their faces washed as if it were Sunday; the women
                    are bobbing curtseys, and the men pulling shaggy forelocks, as we float and
                    rustle up the scarlet cloth put to the chancel door. There are twelve
                    bridesmaids, six innocents in blue, and six in pink; it has been a work of some
                    labour and thought to get that spinster dozen together.</p>
                <p>Female friends Dolly has none, holdingâwas it Cowper's opinionâthat women's
                    friendships were leagues of folly and interest; and it has been difficult to
                    collect, at least in a country neighbourhood, twelve<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7039-280"/> young ladies of fit standing, to walk behind Lady
                    Stockport to the altar. It rather a scratch team after all; we have been obliged

                <p>Little De Laney is best man; not that has any peculiar affection or admiration
                    for the bridegroom, as indeed he told me afterwards that he was âthe biggest
                    fool out,â but because Lord Stockport once shed the radiance of his presence
                    over the corps of which De Laney is a member.</p>

                    rectors, officiate. They all read very fast, and leave out as much as they
                    possibly can, so that whatever else it is, at least the service cannot be said
                    to be tedious. And so the âaugust ceremony,â as the county newspapers said next
                    day, is consummated, and Dolly draws a sigh of relief. I think he is glad that
                    the costly brittle cup has reached her red lips in safety at last. And then we
                    all get into our carriages and bowl home, with the âugly <choice>

                    breakfast.</p>
                <p>âYes,â I say, âit looks so different without its furniture, doesn't it?â</p>
                <p>Lady Lancaster like the fisherman's wife, Ilsabil, has had her own will, and the
                    gathering is as large as even she could wish.</p>
                <p>Looking down the long table, on either side of the forest of ferns and flowers
                    and pyramidal fruit, I see happy peopleâ<emph>these</emph> in Eliseâian

                    nonsense.</p>
                <p>The bridegroom is doing neither; he is eating âpoulet au truffesâ and looking
                    solemnly amorous, and amorously solemn. I fancy that his impending speech is
                    weighing on his mind, and he is wishing that a fellow might be allowed to get
                    married without having to jaw about it. Happiest, noisiest, gorgeousest of

                <p>The Coxes are not presentable certainly, but I insisted on their being asked. I
                    have a kindness for them; they were good to my poor Dick.</p>
                <p>âThere have been a good many changes since then,â says Lord Capel, pleasantly
                    thinking of my marriage.</p>

                <p>âWho is the exception, Capel?â asks De Laney, who is on the other side of me,
                    âproves the rule, doesn't it, eh?â</p>
                <p>âNo, nonsense! M'Gregor, don't you recollect poor M'Gregor?â</p>
                <p>âWhy <emph>poor?</emph>â I ask, trying to smile; âfor not being here?â</p>
                <p>âHavn't you heard? oh, I thought you<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7039-283"/> were sure
                    to; I'm sorry I mentioned the subject.â</p>
                <p>âWhy?â I ask, hoarsely.</p>
                <p>âOh, because it's a shame to introduce melancholy subjects on an occasion like
                    this; bad omen, you know. Stockport would not thank me.â</p>
                <p>âYou had better go on, now you have begun,â says De Laney, âor we shall think it
                    something worse than it is.â</p>
                <p>âWell then, poor fellow! he is dead! I heard of it a day or two ago, from a man
                    who was quartered on the same station with him; died of fever and ague at
                    Lahore! very sad thing! nobody he cared a straw about near him.â</p>
                <p>âDead!â cries Violet Coxe, overhearing, in her hard loud voice; âpoor M'Gregor!
                    Lord! how sorry I am!â</p>
                <p>The bride suddenly rises from her seat, and comes rushing over to me.</p>
                <p>âFor God's sake, don't expose yourself!â</p>
                <p>I hear her whispering very eagerly, and then there sounds a loud buzzing in my
                    ears; a deadly sickness comes over me, and I faint away, as I fainted away

                    life that has been, alas! <q>
                        <l>âFailure, crowning failure, failure from end to end.â</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>My foolish little tale has been dull enough in the telling, I'm afraid; it was
                    not dull in the acting, Heaven knows! It is two years and a half ago now, since
                    that wintry night, when, in my wicked madness, I wanted to sacrifice soul and
                    body to my one, my only love; since he said to me, but in tenderer, more
                    impassioned words, <q>
                        <l>âI could not love thee, dear, so much,</l>
                        <l>Loved I not honour more.â</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>Since then, I have been sorry for my<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7039-286"/> sin; at
                    least I have tried to be. I have been a good wife to Hugh too; I think he would
                    tell you so, if you asked him. It has been upâhill, tiring work, and I have
                    often got out of breath, but it is nearly over now. Yes, my friends, I ask you
                    to bid me God speed, for I am going very far journey, â<foreign xml:lang="fre">je vais chercher un grand peutÃªtre</foreign>.â</p>
                <p>I am dying, and the great smith who strikes off all fetters, is knocking off
                    mine. In the Litany, you know, we pray for deliverance from sudden death, and my
                    prayer has certainly been answered. Never did anyone leave the world with more
                    lagging, lingering feet, than I am going. I am able to watch the steps of my own
                    dissolution. My beauty and my strength are gone from me: they were sorry to go,
                    I think; they went so slowly and I shall not be long after them now.</p>
                <p>Until last winter, I always thought I should live to be an old woman,âlike my
                    motherâinâlaw, perhaps; bony, grenadierâlike, hirsute of lip, and baggy of
                        cheek,<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7039-287"/>
                    <q>
                        <l>âWith a little hoard of maxims,</l>
                        <l>Preaching down a daughter's heart.â</l>
                    </q> But about last Christmas, the idea struck me, came home to me, that never
                    should gray hairs and I make acquaintance; that my head would be laid down in
                    its ruddy glory, before very long, in the chilly sombre vault of the Lancasters.
                    (Oh, if they would but lay me among mine own people!) I looked very well,
                    certainlyâHugh's men friends complimented him (so he told me) on his wife's
                    beauty; such rosy cheeks I had too; I, who used to be pale to a proverb; and my
                    rosy cheeks did not come out of the rouge pot, as the Dowager's wigged compeers
                    curiously hinted to that irate old matron.</p>
                <p>But surely, surely I was getting oddly, unnaccountably thin: my rings took to
                    slipping off my fingers, and rolling into remote corners, and all âme frocks,â
                    like Glorvina's, of lovelorn memory, âhad to be took in.â Also I somehow stopped
                    very often, and leant against the carved banisters; as I went up the shallow,<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7039-288"/> broad oak steps of the grand staircase. One
                    day I spoke out my thought.</p>
                <p>âMother,â I said, (Hugh liked me to call her mother), âdon't you think I'm
                    getting to look very like Jane Stevens, that died of consumption at the West
                    Lodge, last year?â</p>
                <p>âNonsense, my dear,â answered the old lady, very hastily, âyou should not get
                    fanciful; young people of your age often look delicate in such cold weather;
                    don't imagine anything so silly!â</p>
                <p>But she was very much flurried as she spoke, her old nose got red, and two big
                    tears dropped on to her eternal knitting. I asked no more questions; I said no
                    more on the subject, but from that day, I knew that my fate was sealed. So I was
                    going to die; going to be erased from the number of the warm kindly living;
                    going to be numbered with the cold, cold dead, whose battle is over, whose race
                    is run. In their successive generations, <q>
                        <l>âGod's finger touched them and they slept.â</l>
                    </q> Soon, that dread finger would be laid upon<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7039-289"/> me, and there could be no shrinking from under it. I could see quite plain a
                    new tablet over our pew, in Wentworth's dark old church: I could read the black
                    letters traced distinctly on the white marble, â<foreign xml:lang="lat">Hic
                        jacet Eleanora</foreign>.â</p>
                <p>The next Lady Lancaster would be spelling out the Latin words, instead of minding
                    her prayers, would be picturing to herself this dead Eleanora to whom but two
                    and twenty summers had been vouchsafed.</p>
                <p>But where should I myself be at this time? Oh, thought full of unspeakable awe!
                    How that prayer comes home to the souls of all us miserable sinners; a thousand
                    fold more, then, to those of us, who are on the verge of that dark, dark
                    flood!</p>

                    those monks, who put together those grand words. No doubt they agonized to enter
                    at that straight gate; no doubt they sinned, and suffered, and wept as we do
                    now; and oh! in mercy let us hope that they areâ <q>
                        <l>Where God for aye</l>
                        <l>Shall wipe away</l>
                        <l>All tears from every eye.â</l>
                    </q> I wondered much within myself whether I were going to a good place; I
                    rather fancied not; I certainly had no ground for hoping that I was. Heaven had
                    shared but few of my thoughts hitherto.</p>
                <p>All the love and aspirations I had to bestow had been squandered on that intense
                    earthly passion which seemed to be eating up body and soul. It was too late to
                    mend now, but I was sorry it had been so.</p>
                <p>Yet still, on that one subject which<pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7039-290"/> had
                    dominated my whole life, I felt easier and more comfortable than I had been for
                    a long time. I no longer wept in secret, nor felt a gnawing, wearing, mighty
                    longing to see that one face again. He was gone from me but a very little way;
                    justâ <q>
                        <l>âFrom this room into the next.â</l>
                    </q> I had known I could not live without him, and I was not going to do so. God
                    was very good and pitying; he was going to release me from the long pain of
                    existence, and through the grave and gate of death I should pass to my beloved;
                    should see his hero face immortal <emph>then</emph> in its beauty, so that
                    âdecay's effacing fingersâ could never sweep its hues.</p>
                <p>âYou'll be all right again, when the spring comes round, darling little girl!â
                    Hugh would say to me, cheerily, now and then, and would smooth my hair with his
                    kind brown hand, and I always said,</p>
                <p>âYes, dear old fellow, I dare say I shall!â though my all right was different
                    from his.</p>
                <pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7039-291"/>
                <p>Would not it be all right, would not it be passing well with me, when I had gone
                    away with great gladness to be with my beloved for evermore?</p>
                <p>âJune 20th.âI am going so fast! oh, so fast! These are the last words I shall
                    ever write; it is hard, laboursome to me to hold the pencil, but I do not want
                    to leave the story of my poor life incomplete; incompleter at least than the
                    story of all lives must be. Some other hand must put âFinisâ I know.</p>
                <p>âIt is night, and I am sitting in my old dad's chair, watching the stars silently
                    taking their allotted places in the firmament. I have been gazing up into those

                    measureless tracts of ether, or whether in that direction at all, lie the
                    spreading fields of light, rise the walls and towers, shine the golden streets

                    all, the Great Householder, who is ever holding his Marriage Feast, and calling
                    thither whoso hungers, and is weary, may let me creep in, even me, for am I not

                    that land of unpictured, <emph>unpictureable</emph> passionless blissâtrying,
                    with narrow human brain, to compass and take in the idea of the ineffable joys
                    of the blessed souls of the just, in those unfading abodes which they have
                    climbed up the steep ladder of faith to, at last; trying to conjure up before my
