                    Lockefield Gardens. The enterprise remains relatively well-known today because of its long-term
                    importance, both practically and symbolically, to the African American community of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and also because of a historic preservation controversy that swirled around it in the
                    late 1970s and early 1980s. (Ultimately, about two-thirds of the original project was razed; the
                    remaining buildings were rehabilitated and incorporated into a new apartment complex.) Lockefield is
                    invariably-and accurately-described as a federal project constructed under the auspices of the New
                    Deal&apos;s Public Works Administration (PWA). What such a description omits, however, is
                    recognition that Lockefield&apos;s origins involved considerable local initiative. An ad hoc
                    committee of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce had in fact begun examining links between poor
                    housing conditions and the provision of social services to city residents several months before the
                    PWAs Housing Division even existed. Moreover, when the PWA did become involved its initial role was
                    conceived as merely loaning money for the venture, not building the project itself. So although
                    Lockefield Gardens is well known, the story of its local beginnings remains incomplete.</p>
                <p>Housing, if not necessarily housing reform, constituted very much a front-burner issue in the early
                    1930s. Residential construction had peaked in the mid-1920s, several years before the stock market
                    crash in 1929. Thereafter housing starts declined year after year. Construction of residential
                    property dropped by 95 percent between 1928 and 1933, at the same time that non-farm foreclosures
                    skyrocketed. Little wonder that one historian has referred to a &quot;crisis in residential real
                    estate&quot; during these years. Herbert Hoover&apos;s President&apos;s Conference on
                    Home Building and Home Ownership in December 1931 brought together housing experts from around the
                    nation to respond to this dire situation. The conference and the recommendations emanating from it
                    produced few immediate results. They did, however, embody the beginning of a change in attitudes
                    regarding the role of government in housing. One recommendation suggested that government should
                    begin to aid private efforts to house low-income families-an idea that, at least in the <placeName>

                <p>The need to upgrade African American dwellings seemed particularly acute. The report prepared by the
                    conference&apos;s Committee on Negro Housing detailed the substandard living conditions endured
                    by a large percentage of the nation&apos;s black citizens. Hoover&apos;s secretary of
                    commerce, Robert P. Lamont, wrote in the foreword to this volume that the realities of housing in
                    African American neighborhoods &quot;emphasize the present shortcomings of our individualistic
                    theory of housing, and the failure which grows out of expecting each person in our highly complex
                    industrial civilization to provide his own housing as best he may.&quot; Historian Gail Radford
                    observes that &quot;such sentiments were startling enough coming from a cabinet-level official
                    in a Republican administration, but they were all the more surprising given the particularly
                    conservative assumptions with which Lamont started.&quot; Radford concludes that this and
                    similarly &quot;heretical statements&quot; by administration officials &quot;signaled
                    the degree to which confidence in the private market in real estate had deteriorated by
                        1931.&quot;<hi rend="sup">3</hi></p>
                <p>In the spring of 1932, as the Depression deepened, Hoover and his advisors decided that additional
                    federal action was needed to combat the crisis. In mid-May he asked Congress to expand the role of
                    the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), an agency that had been created at his request the
                    previous year and that functioned principally to provide credit to major financial institutions such
                    as banks and insurance companies. The proposed expansion of the RFC&apos;s activities became
                    part of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932. This complex piece of legislation passed
                    through several permutations (Hoover vetoed an initial version), but the bill finally passed in
                    mid-July and the president signed it a week later.</p>
                <p>The act (in Title II, Section 201) empowered the RFC to &quot;make loans to corporations formed
                    wholly for the purpose of providing housing for families of low income, or for the reconstruction of
                    slum areas.&quot; Two provisos, however, severely limited the ability of interested parties to
                    take advantage of the law. First, such &quot;corporations&quot; had to be limited-dividend
                    entities regulated by state or municipal law; only one state (<placeName>

                    </placeName>) had appropriate enabling legislation in place at the time of the act&apos;s
                    passage. Second, the projects had to be &quot;self-liquidating&quot;-in <list

                    RFC loan, plus 5V2 percent interest, within ten years. Taken together, these requirements proved
                    sufficiently onerous that only a single urban housing project (Knickerbocker Village in <placeName>

                    the expansion of the RFC&apos;s responsibilities in late 1932 and early 1933 did establish a
                    precedent for federal involvement in slum removal and public housing. Many communities, <placeName>

                    about 25 percent nationally (much higher in some places), and foreclosures were increasing.
                    Moreover, the RFC&apos;s existing housing program was clearly a failure. &quot;It is against
                    this background of catastrophe,&quot; writes Radford, &quot;that we can begin to understand
                    how ... a program as previously off-limits as federal financing and even outright ownership of
                    low-rent housing could be created.&quot;<hi rend="sup">5</hi></p>
                <p>Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), signed by the president in June 1933, called
                    for a &quot;comprehensive program of public works.&quot; This program became one of the best
                    known of Roosevelt&apos;s so-called &quot;alphabet agencies,&quot; the Public Works
                    Administration (PWA). The legislation granted the new agency power for, among other things,
                    &quot;construction, reconstruction, alteration, or repair under public regulation or control of
                    low-cost housing and slum-clearance projects.&quot; To implement this section of the law
                    Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, who directed the PWA, created a Housing Division that began
                    operation in July. The agency&apos;s first director was <placeName>

                    for industrial workers during World War I. He was thus, as Radford notes, &quot;one of the few

                <p>The Housing Division inherited the RFC&apos;s &quot;limited dividend&quot; program and
                    attempted to make it more viable by liberalizing the provisions that had precluded most communities
                    from taking advantage of it. Interest rates were reduced to 4 percent, loans were made available for
                    up to 85 percent of the estimated costs of a project, and the repayment period was extended from ten
                    to thirty-five years. In response to these relaxed rules, applications began to pour in.<hi

                    the Hoosier capital. One such individual was Joe Rand Beckett, a local architect and attorney, who,
                    as his obituary put it years later, &quot;pioneered in the building of modern housing for

                    He explained the purpose of the committee (which had been created the previous month) and the intent
                    of the committee members to conduct a survey of the &quot;congested and unhealthful

                    section dealing with low-cost housing and slum clearance projects and the fact that such projects
                    had to be &quot;under public regulation or control.&quot; He then noted that the Indiana
                    General Assembly, in its spring 1933 session, had failed to approve enabling legislation for
                    &quot;this class of work.&quot; Was there, Harrison wondered, a way that the
                    &quot;public regulation&quot; criterion could be met in the absence of an authorizing state
                    law? &quot;I am seeking,&quot; he explained, &quot;a way to proceed with an actual
                    project in this city that we have on the boards for low cost housing .... Is there any way that this
                    project can be financed under this federal legislation?&quot; Harrison&apos;s claim that a
                    project was &quot;on the boards&quot; is ambiguous, but it seems doubtful that in June 1933
                    he was referring to actual architectural renderings. More likely, he simply wanted to convey to his

                    conducted with assistance from Indiana University&apos;s Bureau of Social Research, he
                    highlighted the disproportionate spending on social services &quot;to those people living in a

                    remarks, the context clarifies his reference to districts that would have been loosely described as
                    slums. Beckett went on to observe that &quot;there has been quite a little talk by the Federal

                <p>An article in the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> the following month continued the educational process but
                    shifted the focus to the deleterious effects of poor housing. The article&apos;s author, R.
                    Clyde White, was a professor of sociology at Indiana University and director of the Bureau of Social
                    Research. He also served as a member of the Chamber of Commerce&apos;s Community Plan Committee
                    and had been one of the principals involved in the committee&apos;s study. Using that study as a
                    jumping-off point for his newspaper article, he observed, with an environmental determinism
                    reminiscent of Progressive Era rhetoric, that unsightly surroundings &quot;tend to complete the
                    break-down of morale.&quot; On a more practical level, &quot;dampness, inadequate heating
                    facilities, and insanitary conditions endanger health,&quot; and the &quot;contagious
                    diseases which break out most often in such areas are a threat to the entire city.&quot; The

                    The <hi rend="i">Indianapolis Recorder</hi>, the local African American paper, jumped on board
                    immediately, editorializing that the project &quot;will register for this city a forward stride

                    if some local entity raised equity amounting to 15 percent of the total anticipated cost of the
                    project (about $787,000). He also emphasized that the government money was a loan and that dividends
                    to the local organization were limited to 6 percent. Beckett was paraphrased as saying that
                    &quot;plans for handling the local situation were in embryo and that no announcement could be
                    made concerning them just now.&quot;<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Within a few days, however, the press
                    reported that the Chamber of Commerce planned to organize the required limited-dividend corporation
                    that would raise the local funds, that it was prepared to erect 200 dwelling units (of different
                    types) in place of 750 &quot;slum dwellings,&quot; and that the project had been

                    lived.&quot; Lockefield Gardens exemplified this national pattern.<hi rend="sup">18</hi></p>
                <p>Although the proposed project was now public knowledge, much of the activity related to it continued
                    to be carried on behind closed doors. Shortly after September 20, Kohn received a letter postmarked
                    Indianapolis and marked &quot;Personal and Important.&quot; The letter, signed simply
                    &quot;Henry,&quot; included a brief note on an attached document marked with the initials
                    &quot;H.W,&quot; suggesting that its author was the well-known town planner Henry Wright.
                    Wright and Kohn had worked together on the federal housing program during the First World War, and
                    Wright served as a consultant on PWA housing during Kohn&apos;s tenure with the agency. The
                    letter writer advised the division director that notices were being sent out that day for a
                    &quot;non-public meeting tomorrow afternoon&quot; that would include about forty
                    &quot;key business men of the banker, merchant and utility groups.&quot; These individuals,
                    it was hoped, would decide how to organize both a &quot;Housing Company&quot; (the
                    limited-dividend corporation) and a campaign to raise the required local equity. &quot;This
                    notice,&quot; he continued, &quot;carries the Mayor&apos;s name as one of the sponsors,
                    and I am told that he is solidly for the proposition.&quot; After discussing the local plans for
                    financing, Kohn&apos;s correspondent observed that he was &quot;still 100% for this as the
                    best example of rehabilitation so far presented and as completely sound, provided only Mr. Beckett
                    delivers as promised the evidence that he has real civic and favorable political interest behind

                <p>The project took several interesting twists and turns during the next few months. The closed-door,
                    invitation-only meeting of September 21 led to the creation of an entity variously known as the
                    Community Housing Committee or Community Housing Corporation. While technically distinct from the
                    Chamber of Commerce, it was clearly a spin-off from the Community Plan Committee on which Joe
                    Beckett had served, and the two groups shared some overlapping membership. The chairman of the
                    corporation, William H. Trimble, was a realtor and member of the Chamber of Commerce who performed,
                    as a biographical sketch put it, &quot;notable work in the cause of welfare in the capital

                    work-an obvious attempt to garner local support. He also revealed a tentative location for the
                    project: a 29-acre tract bounded by 10th and Torbett Streets on the south, 14th Street on the north,
                    Oregon Street on the east, and Indiana Avenue and Fall Creek on the west. This site was immediately
                    west of the all-black Crispus Attucks High School (currently Attucks Middle School) and somewhat
                    farther north than the eventual Lockefield Gardens location.<hi rend="sup">22</hi></p>
                <p>During the last quarter of 1933 the Community Housing Corporation worked behind the scenes to meet
                    the federal Housing Division&apos;s criteria, especially with regard to the local equity
                    requirement. Simultaneously, corporation members tried to generate support for and to blunt
                    criticism of the proposed project. The arguments in favor focused not only on the presumed
                    advantages of improved housing but also on the economic activity that would be a concomitant of the
                    work. Following an address in which Beckett claimed that the project would employ some 2,000 men for
                    at least one year, the Construction League of Indianapolis adopted a resolution supporting the
                    proposal. Later that fall the city&apos;s Central Labor Union and the Marion County Building
                    Trades Council sent telegrams to Secretary Ickes expressing their approbation. <hi rend="i">The
                        Recorder</hi> remained a consistent proponent. In October its editor highlighted the
                    project&apos;s twin goals: &quot;to put more men back to work at living wages&quot; and
                    to build &quot;healthier homes, and more attractive surroundings for hundreds of deserving
                    families.&quot; Six weeks later the paper denounced the ongoing &quot;squabble over whether
                    or not better dwellings should be errected [sic] in this city to replace the hundreds of unsuitable
                    houses in which thousands are forced to live,&quot; and declared that &quot;the slum must

                    editor also questioned whether putting money into housing for African Americans would be a prudent
                    investment: &quot;Persons who own rental property can judge for themselves just how sound a loan
                    would be at this time to improve housing conditions for negroes.&quot;<hi rend="sup">24</hi></p>
                <p>Two months later the Indianapolis Real Estate Board weighed in with a resolution expressing strong
                    opposition to the housing project. The realtors objected on several grounds, including the fact that
                    the proposal was a &quot;multiple project&quot; (i.e., principally apartments) that thus
                    &quot;detracts from the proved design [intent] of Indianapolis citizens to own their own
                    homes.&quot; In addition, claimed the board, &quot;housing of this type is unattractive to
                    the families for whom it is intended&quot; (an assertion quickly refuted by African American
                    leaders) and &quot;an increase in the total number of housing units in the city is inadvisable
                    until the existing vacancies have been further absorbed.&quot; The <hi rend="i">Indianapolis
                        News</hi> agreed, editorializing that &quot;[s]urely it will be generally conceded that to
                    inflict standardized, government subsidized houses on a community priding itself in its home
                    building and home ownership is taking an undue liberty with the value and individuality of other
                    residence sections, and sounding a discordant note.&quot;<hi rend="sup">25</hi></p>
                <p>While the <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> stood solidly behind the endeavor and reported that &quot;a
                    casual poll of sentiment among the Negroes of the city indicated that they are overwhelmingly in
                    favor of the project,&quot; some black residents expressed concern. At a weekly meeting of the
                    Monday Luncheon Club-which included many of the city&apos;s most influential African American
                    residents, several of whom were also actively involved with the all-black Senate Avenue YMCA-there
                    was &quot;such disagreement of those present that endorsement was withheld.&quot; The
                    principal issue of contention was &quot;insistence by Negro leaders that a large number of the
                    laborers employed in the construction work be Negroes.&quot; In order to avoid &quot;a
                    repetition of the Boulder Dam and other situations in which Negro labor has been excluded,&quot;

                    this was &quot;a matter not directly under their control&quot; since they had &quot;no

                    a different vein, another <hi rend="i">Recorder</hi> article observed that &quot;vehement
                    opposition to the expenditure of so large a sum for the benefit of the Negro population&quot;
                    had led to a proposal to &quot;rebuild a white as well as a colored slum area.&quot;<hi

                <p>Although the idea that a portion of the federal loan should be used to rehabilitate a primarily white
                    residential area never came to pass, its mention in the newspaper was far more than a trial balloon.
                    The <hi rend="i">Times</hi> reported at the end of October that the Housing Division had decided its
                    loan should be used to construct dwellings in both black and white residential sections of <placeName>

                    Community Housing Corporation to Kohn in early November advised that: &quot;<hi rend="i"
                        >Following the suggestions of your department</hi> we have selected an area for a housing unit
                    to be devoted to the tenancy of white people and have narrowed the scope of our negro housing
                    project accordingly.&quot; This document was, in fact, the transmittal letter for the
                    corporation&apos;s formal proposal, numbered 41W, for a white housing project. (A proposal for
                    the African American project, numbered 41N, was submitted simultaneously.) It is not clear whether
                    local complaints about dedicating all the funding to a blacks-only project might have influenced the
                    Housing Division&apos;s decision to pursue improvements in both white and Negro areas.<hi
                        rend="sup">28</hi></p>
                <p>At the same time that a possible white project was first announced, the papers also reported a change
                    in the location of the black project. An inability to secure leases or options on some parcels of
                    land in the area originally targeted had led the planners to move the project several blocks south
                    to a site near the City Hospital. A map included in the Community Housing Corporation&apos;s
                    prospectus for Project Number 41N showed both the original and the revised boundaries-the latter
                    being Indiana Avenue on the north, North Street on the south, Locke Street on the west, and Blake
                    Street on the east, where Lockefield Gardens was eventually constructed.<hi rend="sup">29</hi></p>
                <p>Verbal support for the proposal did not readily translate into financial backing, perhaps in part
                    because of the level of secrecy the organizers attempted to maintain. The <hi rend="i">News</hi>
                    observed in an editorial at the beginning of November that the project &quot;still wants the
                    support of <placeName>

                    lamented that the plan remained &quot;incomplete ... inasmuch as the identity of persons
                    supposed to be urging it is not known, and the financial details . . . have not been
                    revealed.&quot; Apparently stung by such criticism, Trimble released additional information
                    immediately. <list type="footnotes">

                    &quot;match&quot; from $787,000 (15 percent) to $460,000 (9.35 per- cent), organizers were
                    clearly struggling to secure the required amount. Owners of the property to be acquired and
                    architects and builders had agreed &quot;to take part payment in debentures&quot;-that is,
                    to accept bonds backed by nothing more than the general credit of the Community Housing Corporation
                    rather than a lien on particular assets. Cash in hand amounted to only $100,000. On January 22,
                    1934, Ickes told Kohn of his &quot;misgivings about this Indianapolis Community Housing

                    dropped the project.&quot; He emphasized that his decision was final and requested that

                    corporation.&quot; The PWA director was making no promises: &quot;It is almost like putting
                    out money for a new thing, and of course we are going to have to give it comprehensive
                    exploration.&quot; Still, the concept of federal support for housing in the city apparently had
                    not died.<hi rend="sup">35</hi></p>
                <p>Ickes&apos;s about-face was not as precipitate as it seemed. He had, from the start, expressed
                    his skepticism about the likely success of the limited-dividend program that the PWA had inherited
                    from the RFC, and he had seen his concerns borne out during the first few months of the Housing
                    Division&apos;s existence. Radford observes that, although applications began to pour in once
                    the agency liberalized its loan provisions, &quot;few submissions merited serious
                    consideration.&quot; Many proposals &quot;came from organizations sincerely devoted to
                    trying to expand the supply of good low-rent housing in their locales, but their plans, for the most
                    part, were either poorly conceived or underfunded (often both).&quot; In the midst of a national
                    economic crisis, &quot;lack of money and inability to put together plausible financial plans
                    were the critical barriers to participation&quot;-an accurate description of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    housing projects, only seven were approved.<hi rend="sup">36</hi></p>
                <p>Ickes had announced in February 1934 that the limited-dividend program would cease and that the
                    Housing Division would assume direct responsibility for slum clearance and housing construction
                    projects-would undertake, in effect, the role of developer. As Radford has summarized the new
                    arrangement: &quot;The division used local architectural firms and building contractors, but
                    closely supervised all phases of work. It acquired sites in its own name and retained title to land
                    and structures after construction was completed.&quot; This was the procedure under which Ickes
                    suggested in mid-March that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName> proposal was being dropped and that his decision was final, it therefore seems likely
                    that he was already thinking of the Hoosier capital for one of the PWAs own projects. Some of the
                    Housing Division staff clearly did. On <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> architects Merritt Harrison and William Earl Russ, who had been involved with the
                    original proposal. Their discussion, according to a memo sent to Kohn the next day,
                    &quot;revolved around what had best be done now that the total allocation has been
                    changed&quot; from $4.6 million to $3.0 million. So although the level of support had been
                    reduced, federal officials and local proponents shared the assumption that the project would
                    proceed. The smaller budget raised the question of what cuts should be made from the initial plan,
                    with the most obvious issue being whether both black and white projects could now be undertaken.
                    Some difficulty arose in part because property in the proposed white area could not be obtained at a
                    reasonable price and the entire proposal was ultimately scaled back. The memo concluded-and senior
                    Housing Division and PWA administrators apparently accepted the suggestion immediately-that if
                    approximately $3.0 million &quot;is to be used in <placeName>

                    few local complaints surfaced about this decision in subsequent months, but after March 1934 no real
                    question remained that the PWA housing project proposed for the Hoosier capital would be exclusively

                            decisions that restricted the division&apos;s ability to use eminent domain to acquire
                            property when necessary, officials decided &quot;to go forward with no more projects on

                    organizations of the city.&quot; The Monday Luncheon Club passed a resolution asking Secretary
                    Ickes to begin work immediately, and other African American organizations quickly followed suit.<hi
                        rend="sup">40</hi> The Church Federation of Indianapolis, a coalition of the city&apos;s
                    mainline Protestant congregations, determined that it did not have the expertise to judge the
                    &quot;economic, financial or structural plans&quot; for the proposed project. But the
                    federation did &quot;heartily&quot; approve the elimination of slums and the construction in
                    their place of &quot;modern hygienic homes that may be rented at moderate rates within the reach
                    of the low wage earner.&quot;<hi rend="sup">41</hi></p>
                <p>The Chamber of Commerce likewise continued its support of the endeavor. On April 27 the
                    organization&apos;s finance committee passed a resolution supporting the &quot;proposed
                    Community Housing Plan of the Federal Government.&quot; Even more significantly, the
                    chamber&apos;s new executive vice-president, William H. Book, included a strong endorsement of
                    the project in a list of proposals for future Chamber of Commerce activities-proposals that the
                    board of directors promptly adopted. Book, while stressing that the organization should
                    &quot;advance in every possible way the federal slum clearance project in <placeName>

                    project locally.&quot; He argued, however, that the &quot;benefit to the Indianapolis
                    building industry&quot; and the &quot;social benefit to the entire community through
                    elimination of congested, insanitary and crime and disease-producing living conditions&quot;
                    should override any concerns. And then there was the reality of the situation: &quot;The federal
                    government will spend a large sum of money on such projects and since it is to be spent it behooves
                    the people of the city to obtain the greatest possible benefit from the expenditure. <placeName>

                    would offset the reasons for opposition.&quot; Those reasons included &quot;the Federal

                    &quot;economically unsound and wrong in principle.&quot; The realtors expressed their
                    opposition to the federal government &quot;entering into any business or fostering any projects
                    which are in competition with private enterprise or private industry&quot;; they claimed that

                    with 90 percent of the land having been secured as a result of willing seller-willing buyer
                    negotiations, a PWA attorney initiated condemnation proceedings against the entire tract in order to
                    obtain the final 10 percent and to ensure that the Housing Division would have valid title to all
                    properties. By late November more than one hundred families and businesses had moved from the area
                    and the government began to issue checks to those property owners whose parcels had been

                <p>Although the Housing Division and the Chamber of Commerce had worked together in formulating the
                    Lockefield project, they did not agree on all particulars. The federal agency typically requested
                    bids for construction of an entire enterprise. Some smaller <placeName>

                    submitting a bid, and thus an outside firm would inevitably get the job. The chamber took up their
                    cause, writing directly to Ickes to suggest that &quot;the project be divided into three or four
                    units, or that at least bids be taken both on three or four units and on the project as a
                    whole.&quot; There was a &quot;strong likelihood,&quot; the chamber argued, that
                    dividing the work would reduce costs. And, as they candidly admitted, &quot;we are naturally
                    much interested in having our local contractors have [an] opportunity to bid on the
                    project.&quot; In a brief, almost curt, response, Hackett advised that although alternatives had
                    been given careful consideration the division had decided to let the work as a single contract.<hi

                    for being &quot;one of the first to make a survey of its blighted areas and to estimate in
                    dollars and cents the cost of supporting a decaying section.&quot; Following lunch the group
                    took a bus tour of the district and then joined a crowd of residents to watch as a small house in
                    the 800 block of West Walnut Street was quickly razed. (A proposal to dynamite this structure, an
                    action that some local newspapers erroneously reported actually took place, was rejected by the
                    demolition contractor due to safety concerns.) Clearing the 22-acre tract of its buildings, streets,
                    sidewalks, and utilities took several months. The general construction contract was let in the
                    spring of 1935, the formal groundbreaking ceremony took place in July of that year, and Lockefield
                    Gardens (the name was selected in 1936) opened its doors to tenants in early 1938.<hi rend="sup"

                <p>Perhaps the most significant finding, given Lockefield&apos;s usual asso- ciation with the New
                    Deal, is that the concept emerged as a local response to a perceived problem (albeit with hopes for
                    substantial external funding). The Planning and Housing Committee (later the Community Plan
                    Committee) of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored research to identify the
                    city&apos;s housing needs and began searching for solutions, existed before the Housing Division
                    was established. And when local architect Merritt Harrison wrote to the newly created Public Works
                    Administration in June 1933, he referred to an &quot;actual project . . . that we have on the
                    boards for low cost housing.&quot; It is true that <placeName>

                    worked diligently in late 1933 and early 1934 to meet the local equity criterion of the Housing
                    Division&apos;s &quot;limited dividend&quot; program in order to secure a long-term

                    and widely copied, one reason preservationists so adamantly opposed destruction of the complex
                    decades later. The craftsmanship of the buildings has usually been described as having been of the
                    highest quality, but in fact serious construction defects led to considerable criticism and required

                    reconstructing a log cabin, transforming downtown shops into a citywide museum of historical
                    artifacts, and presenting a massive outdoor pageant. Such a celebration was not in itself unusual;
                    many early twentieth-century American communities hosted similar anniversary celebrations that
                    embraced local and national icons, entertained citizens, and heralded the past as a foundation for

                    LaPorte County Historical Society. Historical society reports from the late 1920s mention the
                    commencement of planning for a 1932 celebration, but the society remained largely dormant in the
                    era, and no action followed. Only after the economic transformation that began in October 1929 did
                    LaPorteans begin actively to pursue the idea of a celebration of heritage on a local level.<hi

                    Asked to describe what the Depression did to the nation, Americans imagine small towns like the

                            hardships on farms, then quickly turned the story of economic crisis into one of community

                    German immigrant Meinrad Rumely in 1853. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the

                    focus his attention on creating a school for boys that emphasized physical work, but instead found
                    that his family&apos;s company had fallen on hard times due to his uncle&apos;s management
                    problems and his father&apos;s poor health. Partnering with John Secor, Rumely created the

                <p>The Depression hit the Advance-Rumely company hard. In 1929, it reported losses of $395,000; the

                    other effects of the Depression on local families. Dorothy Rowley, a secretary in the collection
                    department of the Rumely plant from the late 1920s until its closing, recalled that her
                    mother-formerly an employee of a fashionable local clothing store-would stay at home because her
                    shoes were unfit to wear downtown. Lacking money for new cloth, neighbors would pass on outgrown
                    clothing to be disassembled and remade. Men who found work carried lunch pails holding only tomato
                    and onion sandwiches, or, Rowley recalled, only popcorn.<hi rend="sup">7</hi></p>

                        rend="i">Herald-Argus</hi>. &quot;Something should and will be done about it.&quot;
                    Having already communicated with local civic leaders, Frohne suggested that &quot;[e]ach church,
                    lodge, business, etc., could make most splendid use of the opportunity to recount for its members
                    the early history of the organization. It would be a great home-coming for all former LaPorteans. A
                    celebration, such as we are outlining, could serve to unite the entire city as one great community.
                    It would draw people from the entire county and perhaps from other points in the state.&quot;
                    Frohne noted that a &quot;mammoth pageant&quot; was &quot;already being
                    considered,&quot; enthused that &quot;[t]he wigwams of the Indians would once again be

                    effects of the Great Depression he added: &quot;One thing is certain-no great amount of money
                    will be available. Participants will all be asked to donate services and time. It will be a splendid
                    opportunity to do something for the community that we love.&quot; Calling on local residents to
                    face the current problems with inspiration from the past, Frohne promised a &quot;celebration
                    that would be a celebration,&quot; an event that would lift community spirits as it commemorated
                    a selective heritage and verified the status quo.<hi rend="sup">9</hi></p>

                        received relief in this period survive. The late Glenn Linnemann, former president of the county
                        historical society, suspected that the unemployment records had been destroyed by Gene McDonald,
                        a county resident, part-time county employee, amateur historian, and noted local curmudgeon.
                        Linneman believed that McDonald remembered his own family&apos;s struggles during the
                        Depression and did not want families to be embarrassed by the unemployment relief records
                        becoming public. Alan January of the Indiana State Library informs me that no state or national
                        records of unemployment statistics in the county exist prior to the spring of 1933. Alan

                    1830s, he showed that the first settlers had persevered in spite of even greater difficulties.
                    &quot;Now in this Centennial year I think it is well for this community to take stock of just
                    what we have accomplished during the past one hundred years, what progress we have made,&quot;
                    Martin said, adding that &quot;[w]hether we have lived up to all of the possibilities, perhaps
                    time alone will tell.&quot;<hi rend="sup">13</hi></p>
                <p>It quickly became apparent that this celebration of the past dealt with the present as well. An
                    undated manuscript from the centennial files in the LaPorte County Museum presented first a timely
                    assessment: &quot;The present deplorable and distracted conditions of our National and State
                    affairs-the unfavorable progress of the present season-the distress in financial circles-the
                    universal paralysis of all business pursuits, all appeal to us in accents which we cannot disregard,
                    that our expenditures should be attended with prudence and economy.&quot; Following these lines,
                    the author revealed that &quot;[t]he Above words were not spoken by a present-day politician,
                    even though they seem to fit existing conditions like a glove. They were spoken in 1861 when Mayor

                    is nothing new,&quot; the writer continued, &quot;but a Centennial can be celebrated only
                    once in a Century.&quot;<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The centennial committee&apos;s carefully
                    selected vision of community heritage-a series of images of better times and recollections of

                    and a renewed resolution to overcome the trials of the present.</p>
                <p>Contemporary circumstances also helped centennial organizers to determine which aspects of the

                    Belle Storset Sorenson Gunness, a widow living just north of the city. Among the charred ruins,
                    workmen uncovered the bodies of three children and a decapitated woman, &quot;stacked like cord

                    investigations identified numerous cases in which Gunness had received the benefits of fire and life
                    insurance policies. The story of the &quot;mad mistress of murder hill&quot; created a media

                    Historian John Bodnar has observed that &quot;history occupied the minds of Americans to a
                    remarkable extent during the 1930s. Economic decline and social unrest had brought into question
                    some of the most fundamental values promoted in the twentieth century .... The future appeared more
                    uncertain than ever but a past still existed that promised to reaffirm the fact that difficult times
                    had been overcome before.&quot;<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The decisions <placeName>

                    this town viewed their nation, themselves, and their collective past. The contest of symbols that
                    emerged as LaPorteans prepared their written history, log cabin, festivities, and pageant reflected
                    the unique shaping influences of the Depression years.</p>
                <p>SELECTING THE PAST: WRITING THE CENTENNIAL HISTORY</p>
                <p>The most contested aspect of the centennial celebration proved to be the proposed written history. In
                    his April 19 speech to committee chairs, Martin announced a &quot;publicity stunt&quot; to
                    draw in local experts or enthusiasts to research and write a series of articles that would appear in
                    the local newspaper and then be placed in the local library. While &quot;[t]here is not
                    sufficient money on hand&quot; for publishing the articles as a book, wrote Frohne two years
                    later, Martin&apos;s plan put large numbers of citizens to work researching and writing, thereby
                    creating useful work at the same time as recalling the important heritage of the town&apos;s
                    people and institutions.<hi rend="sup">18</hi></p>

                <p>Rumely believed strongly in Progressive reform and maintained a definite &quot;great
                    man&quot; view of history, counting himself among the great men. He emphasized that the ills
                    felt by American workers and industrialists in 1932 could be reduced by relocating to towns like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018975" reg="La Porte">LaPorte</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In such places, residents could find employment in factories during boom times and
                    live on their own farms, producing the food and fuel they needed to survive during slack times.
                    &quot;Only last week,&quot; Rumely reported, &quot;one head of a <placeName>

                    </placeName> industry remarked that the three of his workmen who are best off at the present time
                    are men living just beyond the town on a few acres each, supplementing their factory earnings with
                    products of their own land, living at low expense so that the restricted income of part time
                    employment has still left their families with budget balanced.&quot; Rumely argued that his
                    proposed rural-industrial order was gaining international support; he related the story that Adolf
                    Hitler, asked what his party would do for Germany, had recently responded, &quot;My greatest
                    project is the moving of two millions of families out of our overbuilt cities into the security of
                    home ownership on small plots of land where they can produce their own food.&quot; Rumely added
                    that &quot;[1]ast week the Associated Press carried the Gerhart Hauptmann message urging the
                    Europeans to get back to nature to forget their contemporary woes.&quot;<hi rend="sup">20</hi></p>

                    city&apos;s future growth.&quot;<hi rend="sup">21</hi> In addition to being quite
                    unaffordable to those of his former employees living on popcorn, Rumely&apos;s plan bore the

                    backgrounds, who were associated with many different patriotic, civic, philanthropic, and business
                    organizations. The written history of the centennial became a celebration of the commitment and

                <p>While the written history project brought large numbers of local residents to work remembering and
                    sharing their town&apos;s past, it was by constructing a log cabin in downtown <placeName>

                    heritage. LaPorteans proposed to recreate the home of George Thomas, <placeName>

                    this cabin gave a specific date of commemoration for the centennial celebration, but the symbolism
                    extended far beyond historical reality. Because <placeName>

                    symbolic meanings to log cabins, celebrating them as symbols both of settlers&apos; stamina and
                    hard work and of their primitive way of life and the hardships they faced. When centennial boosters

                    cabin should have looked like. Noted local architect George Allen conceived a building based more on
                    American myth than on research into 1830s cabins in northwest <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a nod to community-conceived heritage rather than actual historical fact. The
                    materials used were symbolic, too. Centennial organizers looking for materials from which to
                    construct the reproduction reused logs from Edward Rumely&apos;s abandoned Interlaken School
                    gymnasium, just north of the city. In salvaging pieces from the recently razed gym, the local
                    Unemployment Relief Committee transmuted a local symbol of industrial training and Progressive Era
                    ideals into a celebration of pre-industrial heritage. Edith Backus later pointed out that while it
                    had taken six weeks for the men of 1932 to build the copy, the pioneers of 1832 had built the
                    original in a day.<hi rend="sup">24</hi></p>
                <p>Despite its rough exterior, the new cabin would have been luxurious by 1832 standards. Local
                    residents loaned furnishings for the centennial celebration, including items used by pioneers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018975" reg="La Porte">LaPorte</settlement>

                    </placeName> families. A few weeks before the dedication of the cabin, Martin announced that a
                    direct descendant of Thomas who did not live in the county would lend two items from the original
                    cabin, and that enthusiastic lenders had already provided enough antiques to furnish several cabins.
                    The list of artifacts shows that the celebrators of the centennial had a great deal more items to
                    choose from for their display than the Thomas family had likely owned when moving in. Among the
                    artifacts on display were some telling anachronisms, such as a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, the

                    most sources, was presently occupied by the New York Central Railway station; the structure built
                    for the commemoration was placed just south of the station in a small wooded park owned by the

                    silk toppers, Prince Albert coats, and boots-rode in on horseback. The men represented the five

                <p>The parade and dedication of the cabin provided the strongest affirmations of civic leadership and
                    &quot;great man&quot; history in the entire centennial celebration. The choice of the seven
                    men-one of whom had not arrived until the year after the founding-served to stress the her- itage of
                    the existing social order. The inclusion of the two young girls likewise reveals a great deal about
                    LaPorteans&apos; use of the past. One of the town&apos;s oldest and longest residents,
                    Catherine Andrew, had come to LaPorte in 1833 at age eight and lived there until her death at age
                    100 in 1925. While her life had come to symbolize the early years of the town for some, the
                    day&apos;s celebration involved little other mention of the town&apos;s &quot;founding
                    mothers.&quot; As historian Mary Ryan found in her study of nine- teenth-century parades in New
                    York, women were often relegated to positions of domestic or anti-political symbols: &quot;Their

                    </placeName> combined new patterns of leisure activity with celebrations of local history as a way
                    to draw larger numbers of citizens into the celebration of their local heritage. Once the playground
                    of &quot;old Americans&quot; or the newly wealthy who wanted to be perceived as such, local
                    history became democratized as large numbers of average Americans tied historical commemoration into
                    the activities they enjoyed in their leisure hours. Civic leaders intended these events to educate
                    as well as celebrate the established social order, yet through this combination of leisure and
                    commemoration, new groups of stakeholders, with new perceptions of community heritage, challenged
                    traditional methods of historical production. <placeName>

                    uncertainty. Organizers acknowledged the benefit of celebrating a community heritage that included

                    celebrate the patriots and pioneers who had established the town, the popular celebration-summed up
                    in the song- evoked a nostalgia for summer days, fall sports, and familiar scenes of leisure
                    activity connected to community.<hi rend="sup">30</hi></p>

                    improve the town&apos;s economic outlook. Window shopping, that quintessential small-town

                    displayed antiques on loan from city residents and the centennial committees in their shop windows.
                    Displays included entire rooms of furniture from the homes of early settlers, photo displays, Civil
                    War weapons and posters, books, and an old wooden hand from the courthouse clock. Dorothy Rowley
                    recalled that the displays served more than an economic function, however, helping residents to get
                    their minds off the Depression. As a result, Rowley states, &quot;they were happier, easy

                <p>The theme of democratizing heritage through leisure was expanded on the evening of September 12, when

                    that excluded ethnic and racial minorities, the fete celebrated the diversity that industrialization
                    had brought, even as it ignored the industries. In his review of the program, <hi rend="i"
                        >Herald-Argus</hi> reporter Robert Coffeen reported that &quot;the sight . .. was not only

                    Fame,&quot; with an African American chorus of twenty voices singing spirituals &quot;in an

                    represented the town&apos;s population: &quot;From all parts of the city they came, as many
                    from the Warsaw addition, perhaps, as Indiana avenue, as many from the Fifth ward as from east of

                    overcome earlier hard times through determination and community spirit, and the inclusion of large
                    numbers of local citizens as either participants or observers of the presentation of that story.

                    this community lies . . . . It was a pageant created by LaPorteans and presented by
                    LaPorteans.&quot; Julian, who estimated the size of the &quot;good-natured crowd&quot;
                    at 8,000, found an audience &quot;expectant and eager to visualize what the heritage of the
                    years was. In every nook and corner of the park and along adjoining streets and roads, hundreds of
                    cars stood as a mute witnesses [sic] to the size of the throng.&quot;<hi rend="sup">36</hi></p>

                    century than the eighteenth-its anachronisms proved telling. By the 1930s, the town boasted three
                    Roman Catholic parishes, with congregants from a variety of ethnic origins. Through its early
                    emphasis on religion, the pageant ties these newer arrivals to the community&apos;s founding.

                    own national military service with the adventures of the voyageurs. The third episode continues the
                    pageant&apos;s narrative of peaceful progress as LaSalle&apos;s men give way to British
                    soldiers shouting their allegiance to King George III. In a particularly enlightening moment, the
                    script explains, &quot;Through the ensuing episode, the Indians are interested spectators
                    only.&quot; As Native Americans watch, the English plant their king&apos;s flag, shout
                    &quot;Long live the King,&quot; and then give way to Spanish troops led by Don Eugenio
                    Pouree who reminds the audience, &quot;This land is not without a Spanish claim.&quot;
                    Pouree heralds the contributions of Christopher Columbus, Hernando De Soto, and the 1781 battle

                    debt of its founding mother, allowing pride in community heritage to intermingle with celebrations
                    of domesticity. As portrayed in the pageant, Benedict celebrates the land that will nurture her
                    family: &quot;Here mother nature shows a smiling face/ These lands seem fertile nurtured by
                    these lakes/ The shelter of the trees will welcome be/ What say you if we stop and take root here?/
                    I see these prairies rich with fields of grain/ I see a genial people gather here/ For others come
                    when once we settle here.&quot; True to her prediction, Benedict&apos;s family is soon
                    joined by another group of hearty pioneers, who &quot;halloo&quot; her and settle nearby.
                    The scene unfolds as newly arrived Hoosiers share hospitality, fellowship, and a message for modern
                    spectators: &quot;To you who live in safety and ease/ And profit from the conquest we once made/
                    We challenge you to guard our spirit well/ And in your breasts to let it burn again.&quot; The

                <p>The pioneer episode ends with a cry carried by a rider across the stage: &quot;The Indians-The
                    Indians-an uprising of the Indians-The Black Hawks are on the warpath.&quot; As the frantic
                    settlers begin to leave, a pioneer mother stops them: &quot;Heed not this cry/ Stay guard your

                <p>This portrayal of the pioneer spirit was particularly significant for the 1932 exploration of the
                    town&apos;s heritage. The Black Hawk uprising, which led pioneer settlers to construct a
                    never-used fortification at nearby Door Village in 1832, was an historical moment celebrated by many
                    generations of <placeName>

                    </placeName> equivalent of Paul Revere&apos;s ride. The construction of the fort at Door Village
                    was remembered by speeches, plaques, and commemorations, a non-event to be remembered in much the
                    way that other towns commemorated local battles, attacks, or other moments of bravery. But the
                    retelling in 1932 was different. Instead of depicting the construction of the fort or the military
                    strength of the male pioneers, &quot;The Heritage of the Years&quot; once again placed a
                    heroine at the center of the stage, emphasizing the importance of the home, family, and land. One
                    can imagine the significance of the moment to audience members who were reading about foreclosures
                    in the Herald-Argus or living through them themselves. As the first half of the pageant ends,
                    &quot;the pioneers drop down on their knees in attitudes of prayer and thanks giving&quot;

                    descendant of the families of two of the men). At best, history might recall these
                    &quot;founders&quot; as real estate investors; at worst, the town might look at them as
                    absentee landlords, a potentially powerful symbol in a town where foreclosures were regular items in
                    local records and the newspaper. Instead, the moment of the town&apos;s incorporation became a
                    watershed in the heritage of the town&apos;s institutions: the five discuss where they will
                    build a church, a school, and a court of law &quot;where justice can be won.&quot;<hi

                <p>A scene set at the new town&apos;s first land auction juxtaposes the founders with a new breed of
                    villains: &quot;Several land speculators have entered who by their dress reveal themselves as
                    strangers. They are regarded by the rest with distrust.&quot; The scene that follows transforms
                    the five founders from real estate investors into patriarchal protectors of the town. One of the
                    strangers &quot;is seen talking to Widow Benedict with threatening attitude; an argument ensues
                    and she runs to John Walker, who comforts her and promises to help.&quot; As the auction begins,
                    Miriam Benedict bids $1.25 per acre for her land; when one of the &quot;strangers&quot;
                    attempts to outbid her, Walker knocks him aside. He addresses the crowd: &quot;Widow Benedict
                    was first to come/ into this wilderness to make her home[.]/ Now in return for courage such as hers/
                    Shall she be robbed thus of her heritage?&quot; The script indicates that the crowd yells
                    &quot;No-justice to Widow Benedict&quot; and &quot;Down with these
                    speculators.&quot; Walker then says, &quot;Show me the man that would now thus outbid/ This
                    widow who by days of honest toil/ Has paid a heavy price for this her land./ Show me the man,
                    I&apos;ll kill him where he stands.&quot; The crowd lays upon the dishonest land speculator,
                    who escapes over a nearby hill. Walker then addresses the crowd: &quot;It is time Congress took
                    action and protected us from the depredations of shyster speculators such as he. If Congress
                    continues in her neglect, in order to secure our right we shall hereafter adopt such measures as may
                    be necessary effectually to secure just claims.&quot; As Walker concludes his speech, settler
                    Charley Cathcart rides in, brandishing an order from President Andrew Jackson that gives each

                    representing the removal of Native Americans on the Trail of Tears and emphasizing the inevitability
                    of the progress that led to the town&apos;s creation and survival. LaSalle and his men then
                    confess that the French came &quot;for wealth and lust for land&quot; that, juxtaposed with
                    the founders&apos; goals, could not be sustained: &quot;But you came with other thought/ In

                <p>The lines spoken by British soldiers who take their place alongside the French transform the
                    revolutionary history of the Old Northwest into a historical justification of the status quo:
                    &quot;This heritage of liberty/ Must holy seem and cherished be/ And by the laws that it
                    creates/ You must abide./ For only through respect for law/ Can liberty exist at all./ The rule of
                    kings withdraws at last/ And you are free.&quot; The pioneer family reminds the audience that
                    &quot;Now profiting by all endured/You live at ease.&quot;<hi rend="sup">45</hi></p>
                <p>As the pioneers yield the stage to &quot;a half dozen or so couples dressed in the fashion of the
                    Civil War&quot; the pageant takes a thematic turn. Fiddlers play the Virginia Reel and the
                    characters begin to dance, soon to be interrupted by &quot;[a]n old negro in shackles . . .
                    followed by two soldiers, one in blue and one in gray.&quot; The blue-clad soldier blows a call
                    to arms, and the cast erupts into a chorus of &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic.&quot;

                <p>This recollection of the Civil War proves particularly rich in meaning. The town had been actively
                    involved in the Union cause, and like most other small towns had made celebration of its
                    veterans&apos; participation a central part of its local history. But the images that centennial
                    celebrants chose to recollect were remarkable. As historian David Blight has shown, by the early
                    twentieth century most commemorations of the war had come to exclude any mention of slavery or race.
                    Because the Northwest Ordinance had outlawed slavery in the territory, <placeName>

                    the Reel, and then portrayed slavery as embodied by one man in shackles, shows a national rather
                    than local memory. Like many other recollections of the Civil War across the <placeName>

                    Hooshier has been used in many of the Western States, for several years, to designate, in a good
                    natural way, an inhabitant of our sister state of <placeName>

                    have attempted, though very unsatisfactorily, to explain this somewhat singular term.&quot; The
                    writer provides two examples-one that a troop of Hussars were mistakenly called Hooshiers and the
                    other the familiar tale of surveyors being greeted with &quot;Who&apos;s here?&quot;-and
                    deems neither &quot;deserving any attention.&quot; The author finally explains:
                    &quot;The word Hooshier is indebted for its existence to that once numerous and unique, but now
                    extinct class of mortals called the Ohio Boatmen.-In its original acceptation it was equivalent to
                    &apos;Ripstaver,&apos; &apos;Scrouger,&apos; &apos;Screamer,&apos;
                    &apos;Bulger,&apos; &apos;Ring-tailroarer,&apos; and a hundred others, equally
                    expressive, but which have never attained to such a respectable standing as itself.&quot; And
                    regarding the term&apos;s tie to <placeName>

                    </placeName>: &quot;By some caprice which can never be explained, the appellation Hooshier

                    </placeName> by G. S. Murdock, a rather hapless soul, who was desperately trying to impress one of
                    Indiana&apos;s more important early citizens, General John Tipton, then serving as Indian Agent
                    at the outpost of Logansport. Tipton had advertised for bids to deliver staples such as salt,
                    tobacco, iron, and steel to <placeName>

                    River</geogName>. Murdock&apos;s letter, written with both haste and flair, was not so much a
                    bid as a plea to be given a chance to do the job with a steamboat that was still being built (in
                    Cincinnati, which is, incidentally, a very long river trip from Logansport). He caps his appeal by
                    announcing that his new steamboat would be named &quot;The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName> Hoosier.&quot;&quot; These words are writ large and with evident pride, whether
                    real or faked convincingly for purposes of persuasion. It seems unlikely in this context that the
                    writer (writing from outside the state) would choose a term of contempt and opprobrium common in the
                    South to make a good impression on a leading citizen of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>

                    </placeName> editor&apos;s attempt to explain the word&apos;s origin, just two years later.</p>
                <p>Indeed, all of the known print references appearing between the 1831 Murdock letter and the 1833
                    editorial prove consistent with a river-related term of pride, specifically attached to <placeName>

                    documents are already recorded, and had been, for the most part, when Dunn was writing. I have
                    discovered two newspaper references from the same period not previously noted, the wording of which
                    I find significant. I will discuss both the previously known and the newly discovered items to
                    demonstrate the consistency of their context.</p>
                <p>The earliest known published use of the word was as a pseudonym in the June 25, 1831, issue of the
                        <hi rend="i">Lawrenceburg Palladium.</hi> The piece allegorically treats an upcoming
                    congressional election as a steamboat race, and its author calls himself
                    &quot;HOOSHER,&quot; ostensibly in reference to the subject matter. Dunn cites this article,
                    adding that &quot;the quotations <list type="footnotes">

                    applies to all Indianans. No other columns in contemporaneous issues use that pseudonym; its choice
                    clearly relates specifically to the steamboat theme.</p>
                <p>One week later, on July 2, 1831, the <hi rend="i">Wabash Herald</hi> published an article that also
                    satirized the upcoming election, but at greater length and employing the conceit of a horse race.
                    About the horse obviously representing Governor Noah Noble, the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>&apos;s
                    columnist says, &quot;[h]e has been corned, littered, and kept in <placeName>

                    >14</hi> But virtually from the founding of the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>, the newspaper had shared
                    with Governor Noble intense support for a canal connecting the <geogName type="river"

                    </placeName> farmers.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Noble&apos;s nickname comes from his support of the
                    canal, an identification made still clearer by the sentence preceding the Noble paragraph, which
                    states of one of Noble&apos;s opponents &quot;that the flying banner floating on the

                    Further connection between the word &quot;hoosher&quot; and support for the canal appears in
                    another section of the same article, not previously noted, presumably because Dunn cited only a

                    dropped the section.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> The original <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> article had covered
                    political races all the way down to congressional and state legislature contests not relevant on the
                    east side of the state. Discussion of the state senate race (&quot;the Parke Senatorial
                    purse&quot;) employs the word &quot;hoosher&quot; three times with consistent
                    application to canal support. The first candidate, writes the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>&apos;s
                    correspondent, &quot;is called the &apos;Canal Hoosher,&apos; . . . and groomed by a
                    Jockey who wears a scarf with &apos;<geogName type="canal" key="tgn_7026035"

                    The second candidate has a strike against him in that he is &quot;kept by a
                    &apos;Railroad,&apos; ... [and] it is thought that the canal banner floating at the
                    &apos;Hoosher stable&apos; . . . will impede his speed.&quot; The section concludes by
                    anticipating a good race &quot;between him and the &apos;Canal
                        Hoosher.&apos;&quot;<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The theme of canal-railroad politics recurs
                    throughout this political allegory, and all four occurrences of the word &quot;hoosher&quot;
                    (including the reference to Noah Noble) are tied to support for the canal. It may be, in fact, that
                    the word&apos;s rapid rise from obscurity to popularity resulted from its association with a key
                    demographic group in the hottest issue of the era.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> carried another relevant article-not previously noted in the literature
                    on this topic-the following week. Authored by &quot;Common Sense&quot; and entitled

                    completed or not, since the need for farmers to get to the Ohio River and on to points south would
                    remain in any case. I quote at some length to make clear the context in which the word

                    1831 use of the word by Murdock (who was indeed a boatman), the June 1831 printing of the word in
                    association with steamboats, and the 1833 analysis by the <placeName>

                <p>Subsequent known printings (while the word presumably gained oral familiarity very quickly) remain

                    Dunn cites two examples from the first half of 1832. The first, a &quot;Carrier&apos;s
                    Address&quot; poem in the January 3 issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Democrat</hi>, intro-
                    duces the word (again, significantly, in quotation marks) in a lengthy if somewhat obscure passage
                    about the canal debate.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> The second example perfectly illustrates the

                            built. The writer phrases the pro-canal position as &quot;A full compliance with all
                            contracts&quot; and emphasizes that &quot;purchasers of Canal lands&quot; are
                            clamoring for the canal to be built, while the &quot;remote and sordid&quot; people

                            alternative political proposal, or it may just be a sarcastic way of saying these anti-tax
                            people want the &quot;hoosiers&quot; to stay put on their farms, operating a

                    challenging the conventional paradigm of a southern insult going back many years, I have endeavored
                    to focus the search considerably. Obviously the word was in use before G. S. Murdock wrote it for
                    persuasive effect, and we need to examine closely river life around 1830 to determine how that use
                    began. This magazine recently published the 1834 journal of <placeName>

                    contemporary sources-newspapers, published correspondence, memoirs, and travel accounts (but not

                    aspect of frontier politics) eventually ended his career prematurely.</p>

                    first as the president of the Constitutional Convention in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1816, and then as a two-term governor, 1816-1822. His public service, which also
                    included his controversial participation in negotiating the 1818 Treaty of St. Mary&apos;s (also
                    known as the New Purchase Treaty), concluded with election five times to the House of
                    Representatives, where he served from 1822-1831.</p>
                <p>Regrettably, however, there are a few flaws in the book-the curious omission of important details,
                    some problems with chronology, and frequent incomplete, undated citations to the published
                    correspondence. Even the date of Jennings&apos;s death, when first given (p. xxvi), is off by
                    two years, and there are at least two garbled sentences and well more than two misspellings and
                    grammatical errors. The omissions include the place of both Jennings&apos;s birth and death, and
                    information about his formal education. More significant, though, is the lack of context or basic
                    information (for example, about territorial government) that is necessary for an appreciation of the
                    role that Jennings played in it. Similarly, although Mills provides ample detail about the conduct
                    of political campaigns on the frontier, once he gets Jennings into office-either as governor or
                    member of Congress-we learn almost nothing about the issues of the day or any actions taken by the
                    incumbent beyond plans for the next &quot;canvass.&quot;</p>

                    dangers of life on the frontier (especially chapter 2), and it offers fresh insights into the
                    characters of Harrison, &quot;a calculating politician&quot; (p. 42), and of the fussy,
                    insecure John Badollet, the land registrar at Vincennes. But the portrait of Jennings remains
                    indistinct and blurred; the man&apos;s personality, wracked by what Mills terms the
                    &quot;disease&quot; of alcoholism, and his achievements, once acknowledged by all, remain
                    unexplored. This book neither proves nor disproves Donald F Carmony&apos;s comment, in his

                    abbey or other monastics, they nonetheless include inviting case studies for social, cultural, and
                    religious historians. Matthias Neuman, in his rather straightforward article on the monastic
                    chaplaincy to the Ferdinand nuns, narrates a story of an ever-increasing demand for autonomy on the
                    part of the nuns-a microcosm of similar dynamics occurring in other women&apos;s congregations
                    with male chaplains and, to some degree, among American women religious in general. Joel Rippinger,

                    </placeName>, discusses the career of Bishop Martin Marty, a founder of the abbey and later a
                    missionary bishop on the Great Plains. Davis&apos;s own essay, a superb case study of the
                    brick-and-mortar ethos of American Catholicism in the early twentieth century, identifies ways in
                    which Ignatious Esser&apos;s expansion of the monastery resembled the work of many other major
                    clerical leaders of the time. Edward Shaughnessy&apos;s account of the building of the
                    monastery&apos;s huge Romanesque Our Lady of Einsiedeln Church offers considerable evidence of a
                    building that aimed &quot;to bring the old world into the new.&quot; Designed by the
                    little-studied but prolific Franciscan architect, Brother Adrian Wewer, the abbey church celebrated
                    the larger impact of the monastery as &quot;old <placeName>

                    Malloy&apos;s work on the interior decor and ecclesiastical furnishings opens the door wider
                    onto the inner world of Benedictine life and its effort to transfer the rich spiritual tradition of
                    European monasticism to America.</p>
                <p>Davis has done an admirable job of editing these essays. This collection reveals much about American
                    monasticism, American Catholic intellectual life, ethno-history, the evolution of Catholic

                <p>W. A. Firstenberger&apos;s short pictorial history of Sunday, <hi rend="i">In Rare Form</hi>,
                    makes a far more important contribution than its title and relative brevity might suggest. Organized
                    chronologically, chapters of text illustrated by photographs of significant artifacts take up Billy
                    and Helen&apos;s origins and then proceed through major chapters in Billy&apos;s life as an
                    evangelist. Especially interesting to me are reproductions of posters and other advertisements for
                    Sunday&apos;s revivals, as well as reproductions of cartoons and other images critical of him. I
                    was struck by the image of a newspaper ad, run by the Ku Klux Klan in <placeName>

                <p>The appendices are as helpful as the main text: one lists by state all of Sunday&apos;s
                    appearances; another lists recorded conversions from his revivals between 1896 and 1923; another
                    lists all the members of Sunday&apos;s evangelistic teams; the fourth gives the genealogy of
                    both Billy and Helen. This book is a must for anyone interested in Billy Sunday.</p>

                    Rowman and Littlefield Publishing Group, 2005. Pp. 256. Illustrations. $32.00.)</head>
                <p>This beautifully designed book provides readers with a fleeting glimpse into the social lives of
                    those economically privileged Americans whom readers may know better through the novels of Henry
                    James, Edith Wharton, and other nineteenth-and early twentieth-century writers. While these
                    novelists employed fictional devices to examine the fraction of society that created its own social
                    order and influenced the nation&apos;s business and politics, <hi rend="i">The Chronicle of
                        Catherine Eddy Beveridge</hi> combines the actual journal entries of one such individual (begun
                    while she was a young woman and revised during the later stages of her life) with the extensive
                    research of her grandson, Albert Beveridge III, and co-author Susan Radomsky, to create a portrait
                    rich in historical context.</p>
                <p>Lavishly illustrated with photographs of the Beveridge family, this volume opens with an explanatory
                    preface and &quot;personal introduction&quot; designed to familiarize readers with the
                    person whom Albert J. Beveridge III knew as his grandmother. Catherine&apos;s influence on the
                    author&apos;s upbringing and on his subsequent life choices is clear, and his engaging
                    particulars (such as a discussion of her horses and dogs, particularly her dachshunds) reveal the
                    complex person not completely illuminated in the pages of her own revised journal. Beveridge and
                    Radomsky also provide a brief introduction to each section of the journal to supplement historical
                    and social contexts that the diarist&apos;s originally intended audience-her children,
                    grandchildren, and perhaps other members of her social class-would have understood.</p>
                <p>Catherine&apos;s diary begins with the preparations of her wardrobe in the fashion district of <placeName>

                    presentation at the royal courts of Europe. Her diary is filled with details of her clothes,
                    jewelry, and other social details of the period. She is most transparent when <pb n="201"
                        id="VAA4025-103-2-085"/> writing about her dearly loved pets. As her diary continues through its
                    conclusion in 1908, she writes extensively of the social engagements, dinners, parties, and meetings
                    with other members of the privileged classes, maintaining a record of significant social connections

                <p>Of course, Catherine&apos;s own subsequent editorial intervention creates some challenges for
                    readers; clearly, she altered her text to offer a retrospective understanding of events and to add
                    details regarding the future of certain actors in her journal. Whether she deleted some original
                    material in her revision remains uncertain, but she certainly maintained a strong sense of a more
                    public reader through her own revisions. The authors&apos; own extensive side notes further add
                    to the diary&apos;s historical context.</p>
                <p>In his &quot;Afterword&quot;, Albert Beveridge III offers some details of his
                    grandmother&apos;s life after the close of her diary, describing Senator Beveridge&apos;s
                    term in Congress, the lives of the Beveridge children, and Catherine&apos;s continued
                    contributions to public life. Additionally, Beveridge includes an extensive essay detailing
                    Catherine&apos;s family history and providing significant background material, as well as a
                    &quot;dramatis personae&quot; section detailing the names of the individuals who appear in
                    Catherine&apos;s diary. These additional sections provide considerable contextual material that
                    helps the reader understand the political and social world of Catherine Eddy Beveridge.</p>

                <p>Two essays address Ohio&apos;s early political development. Donald J. Ratcliffe&apos;s

                    </placeName> being the first. Ellen Eslinger observes, in &quot;The Evolution of Racial Politics
                    in Early <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region>

                    legal slaveholding&quot; (p. 81). Yet, despite the Northwest Ordinance&apos;s prohibition on
                    slavery, racial policy soon became a flashpoint of contention, reflecting a society at odds with
                    itself. The black laws, for example, would contradict what Eslinger terms <placeName>

                    chance to flourish without pressure either from the &quot;old established colonial
                    denominations&quot; or from slavery (p. 74). Kenneth H. Wheeler, in &quot;How Colleges
                    Shaped a Public Culture of Usefulness,&quot; argues that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio&apos;s</region>
                    </placeName> liberality in chartering privately funded, denominational colleges contributed to a
                    culture that valued productivity, practicality, and piety. The colleges served as public arenas in
                    spreading this cultural outlook. Tamara Gaskell Miller&apos;s look at family and kinship in
                    &quot;&apos;My whole enjoyment &amp; almost my existence depends upon my
                    friends&apos;&quot; is weak in several respects. While she correctly notes that migrants to <placeName>

                    123), other assertions are dubious. To state, for example, that &quot;it was precisely this
                    desire to keep families together that prompted so many to move west&quot; (p. 125) is to unduly
                    minimize the primary economic concerns that motivated many migrants, as well as the facts that
                    migration often split families to begin with, and that the children of migrants often migrated
                    further west or left home to learn trades.</p>

                <p>In the wake of the Second Great Awakening, a radical new religious movement swept across the Upper
                    South and the Midwest. Adherents to this movement-calling themselves variously Campbellites,
                    Stoneites, Disciples of Christ, or simply Christians-sought to abolish all denominations and
                    divisions within Christianity by restoring it to its primitive first-century simplicity. Many
                    frontier people found this hopeful message beguiling. By 1850, the Stone/Campbellites numbered
                    nearly a quarter million, with 186 &quot;Restorationist&quot; congregations in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName> alone. In time, its growth would slow and the movement would splinter, but not before
                    this quintessentially midwestern sect had established an enduring national presence.</p>
                <p>Much critical scholarship has been produced of late focusing on the early history of the
                    Stone/Campbellite movement, especially its eponymous leaders, the retiring Barton Stone and the
                    fiery Alexander Campbell. Few scholars, however, have addressed the foot soldiers of the movement,
                    those regional leaders and preachers who abandoned their previous denominational ties to champion
                    this radical vision of unity. Elder John Sparks, in his exhaustively researched <hi rend="i">Raccoon
                        John Smith</hi>, does a masterful job rescuing just such a regional leader from the distortions
                    and obscurity of denominational <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-103-2-088"/> hagiography. John Smith (1784-
                    1868), as his sobriquet &quot;Raccoon&quot; suggests, was backwoods born and bred, spending
                    all his adult life in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Educational opportunities were few, but the chaotic frontier gave him plenty of
                    opportunities to hone his native intelligence and sharpen his famously acerbic wit. Despite
                    experiencing firsthand some of the greatest excesses of frontier revivalism, and despite his
                    youthful flirtation with skepticism, Smith chose the life of a Baptist farmer-preacher, eventually
                    rising high within the patronage system of the Kentucky General Union of Baptists. The Union,
                    comprised of congregations of both Regular (Calvinist) and Separatist (Arminian) Baptists, was
                    inherently unstable, a fact the ambitious young preacher exploited with aplomb. In time, however,
                    Smith&apos;s ambition and his intellectual development would lead him to repudiate the Baptist
                    organization entirely. Denied high office within the Union because of his increasingly outspoken
                    &quot;Restorationist&quot; sympathies, Smith broke with the Baptists in 1828 and became a
                    devoted follower of Alexander Campbell. Five years later, he helped to facilitate the union of
                    Campbell&apos;s Disciples and Stone&apos;s Christians at the famous Lexington New
                    Year&apos;s Day meeting. By the time of his death three decades later, Smith was revered in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and much of the Midwest as a tireless proselytizer for the movement.</p>
                <p>While Smith was admittedly a secondary character in the great antebellum
                    &quot;Restoration,&quot; the sheer detail of Sparks&apos;s biography powerfully evokes
                    the religious world of the frontier. Sparks nicely contextualizes the theological antinomies of
                    Calvinism vs. Arminianism, creedalism vs. liberalism, and pietism vs. rationalism that catalyzed the
                    primitivist impulses behind the Stone/Campbellite movement. In a larger sense, <hi rend="i">Raccoon
                        John Smith</hi> is also an illuminating case study of some of the perennial, if less than
                    edifying aspects of denominational dynamics-what might be called the dark side of religious
                    voluntarism. Sparks makes it clear that the internal politics of the Baptist Union were as byzantine
                    and brutal as anything before or since, and that, despite subsequent romanticism, the emergence of
                    the Disciples tradition out of existing denominations like the Baptists was a painful process that
                    left bitter feelings, the repercussions of which continue to this day. Perhaps it is good to be
                    reminded that the religious marketplace-like any market- place-is rarely a friendly place, and that
                    while such competition is to be celebrated, its human cost is inevitable. For students of the
                    religious history of the Midwest or the antebellum frontier in general, or for those interested in
                    the sociology of religion, I highly recommend this book.</p>

                    intersection between overarching historical events and personal spiritual conviction.</p>
                <p>Spalding&apos;s work embraced the years 1813 to 1858, a time when the country confronted the
                    challenges of territorial expansion, economic instability, rising immigration, vicious nativism, and
                    widespread slavery. <placeName>

                    </placeName> proved to be influenced by all those elements, as were Mother Catherine and her

                    </placeName>, as Spalding experienced it, underscored the struggles of a frontier church overseen in
                    the main by imperious and abrasive foreign-born clerics, who showed few qualms about exploiting the
                    sisters laboring in poverty at mission outposts.</p>
                <p>The author draws on an impressive array of primary materials-many of them in the archives of the
                    Sisters of Charity of Nazareth at <placeName>

                    who effectively energized education and health services on the midwestern frontier. Employing
                    meticulous research, Doyle-herself a member of Spalding&apos;s congregation-keeps a balanced
                    tone, generally avoiding hagiography and never claiming more than the documents substantiate. Doyle
                    maps out the hardships of life and death at western missions; the economic uncertainties facing a
                    new congregation; the clashes with religious and secular associates; the sorrows, joys, and
                    friendships within a community of vowed religious; the successes and failures for women in a rigidly
                    gendered church; and the stresses created by a virulent anti-Catholicism that settled over <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Some lay readers may find the detail daunting, but the author aims to resolve certain
                    mysteries and controversies surrounding Spalding&apos;s life and she tries to do so thoroughly
                    and fairly.</p>
                <p>Most impressively, the author tackles the unpleasant subject of slave-holding by Spalding and her
                    sisters-including an account of the death by poisoning of Sister Ann Spalding (Mother
                    Catherine&apos;s biological sister) at the hands of a young black girl. Doyle&apos;s direct
                    confrontation of this sensitive topic stands out <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-103-2-090"/> as a highly
                    commendable feature of this study. Still, the author&apos;s conclusion that slave ownership
                    reflected, among other factors, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> culture and economics of the era remains less than satisfying. Historians have not been
                    willing to excuse Thomas Jefferson for his slave-operated plantation by virtue of the
                    &quot;product of his times&quot; argument; the Quaker John Woolman, as some have noted,
                    mounted unpopular anti-slavery protests as early as the 1750s.</p>
                <p>If Doyle falters in this area, she more than compensates in her conclusions about the growth of
                    social justice initiatives by Spalding&apos;s congregation. Doyle&apos;s gracefully written
                    summary links the past to the present, demonstrating that Spalding&apos;s complex legacy led her
                    religious daughters to activism that trancended state, region, and country and promoted the best
                    impulses for the well-being of all peoples. <hi rend="i">Pioneer Spirit: Catherine Spalding, Sister

                <p>Suellen Hoy, guest professor of history at the University of Notre Dame, has written an important
                    collection of essays on the history of the nuns of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Hoy&apos;s work takes us on an intellectual journey, following the path of the
                    nuns from the 1846 arrival of five Sisters of Mercy (the first community of nuns in the city) to the
                    highly visible efforts of the nuns who took part in the civil rights demonstrations of the 1960s.
                    Along the way, she establishes a rightful place for these women in the historical discussion of
                    urban women activists. As American academics have been largely uncomfortable with, or ignorant of,
                    the role of religious leaders in shaping our modern cities, historians have not yet adequately
                    documented these stories. Hoy&apos;s collection goes a long way towards remedying this over- <pb
                        n="207" id="VAA4025-103-2-091"/> sight. As she forcefully argues, the service provided to the
                    poor by Catholic sisters predates the labor of Jane Addams&apos;s Hull House and deserves more
                    recognition than it garnered previously.</p>
                <p>Hoy&apos;s compelling first chapter, &quot;The Journey Out: From <placeName>

                    </placeName>,&quot; covers the female chain migration of Catholic sisters leaving <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Readers learn of the status-driven system by which women with few prospects in their
                    homeland were recruited for religious work in <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                    </placeName>, but only if they had a dowry. Impoverished women wishing to join the religious
                    movement could sign on as lay sisters, providing domestic labor to the communities but without the
                    status of so-called choir sisters. Hoy&apos;s work here adds nuances to our understanding of
                    Irish immigration, especially the immigration of Irish women. Her final chapter, &quot;Marching
                    for Racial Justice in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the 1960s,&quot; opens up the history of activist nuns who marched in the
                    streets of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, protesting the racist policies of the Illinois Club for Catholic Women as well as
                    segregation in the public schools. Here, we see nuns breaking out of a cloistered life and pursuing
                    social justice. Hoy&apos;s account of the sisters&apos; outreach programs, including the
                    Marillac House settlement and Sister Mary William&apos;s Rendu House (operating out of Rockwell
                    Gardens public housing project), prove riveting.</p>
                <p>Hoy&apos;s work leaves many questions unanswered. Because the chapters are all previously
                    published articles, readers are left with both a repetition of themes and a less than thorough
                    discussion of the place of nuns in the history of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. A glossary would have made the work more accessible to a non-Catholic audience; the
                    addition of a conclusion would have tightened the book&apos;s varied contents. I would have
                    liked to see chapters reworked to include more of Hoy&apos;s thoughts on the place of these nuns
                    in urban history generally. Individual actors do not jump from the pages as they might; provocative
                    figures like Saint Katherine Drexel and Sister Mary Williams do not emerge as full-blown historical
                    figures. The rich photographic record included here partially makes up for such issues. Perhaps the
                    nature of the primary sources (Hoy explains that the sisters did not document what they did or seek
                    glory for the work) leads to the flattened nature of these biographical sketches. Readers would also
                    benefit from a broader discussion of Catholic visions of social justice and aid to the poor. What
                    motivated this urban activism, and what were the limits of the change the sisters proposed?</p>

                <p>This valuable study documents the ways in which social class, gender, and professional and

                    </placeName> during the period from 1930 to 1955-a time of flourishing art, theater, music, and
                    intellectualism in the city&apos;s African American community. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> writers emphasized the idea that black art needed to combine aesthetics and function
                    and to serve the cause of black freedom. The period also coincided with the arrival and assimilation
                    of thousands of rural migrants from the South.</p>
                <p>Knupfer argues that black women&apos;s activism crossed political, social, and cultural
                    boundaries in linking black art, literature, music, history, and community outreach to greater
                    transnational struggles. Examining the efforts of club women, members of black sororities, school
                    teachers, artists and writers, founders of cultural and social institutions, and ministers she
                    argues that a pan-African intellectual activism fueled the arts and social protest of local black
                    women and created the momentum necessary to sustain the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Black Renaissance.</p>
                <p>In the chapter, &quot;Women&apos;s Activism in Public Housing,&quot; Knupfer expands this
                    argument to include the crucial role played by activist working-class and poor women through their
                    involvement in tenant associations in two housing projects, the Ida B. Wells Homes and the Algeld
                    Gardens Homes. Most residents of public housing from the 1930s through 1950s, she informs, were not
                    on public relief or assistance but were gainfully employed. Yet social institutions such as the
                    Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) and the South Parkway <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-103-2-093"/> YWCA
                    (SPY), expecting middle-class behavior, refused to work with female tenants or to respect their way
                    of organizing. There was little crossover of class lines between those tenant organizers and their
                    middle-class sisters; residents of the two public housing sites generally did not belong to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago&apos;s</settlement>
                    </placeName> leading black female organizations. In focusing on the contribution of these
                    organizers, this volume joins the recent scholarship examining the grassroots activism of working
                    poor women during the civil rights movement.</p>
                <p>The book also provides a significant contribution to the historical literature on African American
                    women&apos;s activism. Through her discussion of women&apos;s successful efforts to reform
                    overcrowded, segregated schools, Knupfer convincingly demonstrates that black women of all social
                    classes historically associate children&apos;s welfare issues with political and social change.
                    Her work reminds us today that the activism of working-class women has not been fully documented, in
                    part because scholars continue to &quot;fragment activism from mothering&quot; (p. 150). By
                    putting her analysis in a broader context of African American activism, the author suggests the
                    black renaissance paved the way for the 1960s-era civil rights movement in <placeName>

                <p>Recently, in many successful lawsuits, Native American tribes have received payment for territory
                    that was illegally taken over a century ago. While the principles behind these victories are often
                    misunderstood by those <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-103-2-094"/> unfamiliar with the history of American
                    Indian law, two new books help provide clarity. Stuart Banner&apos;s <hi rend="i">How the
                        Indians Lost Their Land</hi> examines Indian property rights and the mechanisms of land transfer
                    from the colonial era through the 1930s. According to Banner, the exchange of land was neither a
                    simple matter of conquest, nor entirely voluntary, but rather existed along a continuum between
                    absolute force and the willful sale of land. Yet, from the colonial era through the early twentieth
                    century, land transfers occurred increasingly under coercion.</p>
                <p>Banner posits distinct periods wherein intercultural power relationships and non-Indians&apos;
                    understanding of Indian land ownership changed markedly. His early chapters argue that the first
                    English settlers squabbled among themselves over the nature of Indian land ownership: Could
                    Christians simply take &quot;heathens&apos; &quot; land? Or was it necessary to purchase
                    such territory? By the end of the seventeenth century, the confusion was resolved: English settlers
                    agreed that Indians possessed their lands outright and settlers were legally bound to buy titles
                    from the Indians. While such sales often followed from violence, epidemics, and economic dependency,
                    the transfer of title from one party to another in exchange for payment proved the norm. Later, the
                    Proclamation of 1763 prohibited anyone except royal officials from purchasing Indian lands, a policy
                    that effectively drove down the price Indians might receive on the free market. After the American
                    Revolution, Euro-American thinking shifted again. The land of those tribes that had fought against
                    the Americans could now be acquired by right of conquest, obviating the need for purchase. Even
                    allied or neutral tribes suffered from restrictions, as the Constitution allowed only the federal
                    government to acquire Indian lands. As state governments and frontier residents grew increasingly
                    desirous for land, they pressured the federal government to use its land-purchasing powers to cajole
                    or threaten Indians to cede lands.</p>
                <p>These pressures led to another shift, embodied in the Supreme Court&apos;s 1823 <hi rend="i"
                        >Johnson v. M&apos;Intosh</hi> decision. Justice John Marshall used this case to posit the
                    &quot;discovery doctrine,&quot; which asserted that Indians had never enjoyed full rights to
                    their lands after the Europeans&apos; discovery of <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                    </placeName>. Instead, he reasoned, they had merely held the right to &quot;occupancy,&quot;
                    a right that could be extinguished at the will of the European discoverer, and later, the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country>
                    </placeName> government. Banner emphasizes the contrast between Marshall&apos;s decision and the
                    way in which colonists actually conceived of Indian land ownership. Yet, with
                    &quot;occupancy&quot; as the applicable legal principle, the decision provided the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                    </placeName> with legal justification to acquire territory without solid Indian consent. Later
                    periods of removal, reservation, and allotment saw Indians forced onto smaller plots of land, <pb
                        n="211" id="VAA4025-103-2-095"/> resulting in increasing territorial losses. Banner&apos;s
                    narrative skillfully unpacks centuries of legal decisions, examining their contradictions and the
                    controversies they engendered, and defining the legal jargon in layman&apos;s terms. His work
                    will prove an especially good resource for generalists who want a greater understanding of the
                    complex legal and political relationship between Indians and non-Indians.</p>
                <p>Lindsay G. Robertson&apos;s <hi rend="i">Conquest by Law</hi> focuses specifically on one key
                    episode in Banner&apos;s broader narrative: <hi rend="i">Johnson v. M&apos;Intosh</hi>.
                    Robertson provides a detailed history of the case, beginning with the Illinois and Wabash Land
                    Companies&apos; original land purchases in what became southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a decade after (and in clear violation of) the Proclamation of 1763-purchases that
                    formed the basis for Johnson&apos;s land claim. For Robertson, Marshall&apos;s extensive
                    treatment of the discovery doctrine can be explained, in part, by his desire to quash
                    Johnson&apos;s suit, and in part, by his deference to Revolutionary War veterans, whose claims
                    would have been jeopardized by a decision for Johnson. Marshall&apos;s long explication, he
                    argues, was otherwise superfluous to the case at hand, even as it exerted long-lasting impact on
                    Indian law (Marshall tried to revise the principle a decade later in <hi rend="i">Worcester v. <placeName>
                            <region type="state" key="tgn_7007248" reg="Georgia">Georgia</region>
                        </placeName></hi> [1832]).</p>
                <p>Robertson&apos;s contribution to this discussion is considerable. He has uncovered corporate
                    records of the United Illinois and Wabash Land Companies stored in a trunk owned by a descendant of
                    an officer of the company. The previously unexamined documents enrich his discussion of litigious
                    persistence and reveal a shocking amount of legal collusion by the attorneys on both sides of the
                    case. The story is an intriguing one, and it elucidates the murky legislative and judicial history
                    of the late-colonial era and the Early Republic. His discussions of the origins of the dubious
                    &quot;discovery doctrine,&quot; and of Marshall&apos;s own attempts to rein it in during
                    the removal era, constitute his most significant contributions. In fact, Banner states explicitly
                    that Robertson&apos;s dissertation and earlier articles formed the basis of his own discussion
                    of the <hi rend="i">Johnson</hi> case (p. 321). Obviously, Robertson&apos;s analysis of <hi
                        rend="i">Johnson</hi> has already influenced the field. While <hi rend="i">Conquest by Law</hi>
                    might be a challenging book for an undergraduate audience, those interested in the territorial
                    history of the Midwest or the Early Republic will find in it a dramatic account coupled with a
                    scholarly analysis of a long standing but problematic legal principle.</p>

                <p>Today, scholars who write about Native Americans must go beyond the familiar archive of nationalist
                    romances and official histories and search for traces of indigeneity wherever they can, from the
                    libraries of <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_1000080" reg="Italia">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> to the landfills of the Canadian West. Both Gordon Sayre and Harry J. Brown take us
                    into these excitingly expanded new archives, and both connect the new materials to more familiar
                    sources.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="i">The Indian Chief as Tragic Hero</hi>, Sayre focuses on poems, plays, and novels about
                    Indian chiefs. He puts these literary works into the context of an array of sources that includes
                    non-alphabetic native records like the images of the Florentine Codex, as well as unsuspected
                    textual sources including Aristotle&apos;s <hi rend="i">Poetics</hi>, Rene Girard&apos;s
                    literary theories, and even, in the case of Pontiac, the history of the American automobile
                    industry. Pontiac is one of the best examples of Sayre&apos;s central thesis: Although he led an
                    uprising that was considered terrorist, Pontiac was framed as a tragic hero, and almost instantly
                    absorbed into American culture as an admirable figure. It is hard to imagine <placeName>

                <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-103-2-097"/>
                <p>Sayre argues that stories of violent native resistance to colonialism cast regular Indian rebels as
                    brutal or demonic, but their leaders-he looks in particular at Moctezuma, Metacom, Pontiac, Logan,
                    and Tecumseh-are framed as tragic heroes who offer their conquerors an opportunity for catharsis, a
                    psychological cleansing that can heal the spiritual wounds of violence. Sayre works deftly with his
                    multitude of sources; his book is a triumphant example of the benefits of interdisciplinarity and
                    the inclusive approach to evidence.</p>
                <p>Brown&apos;s <hi rend="i">Injun Joe&apos;s Ghost</hi> also works within a remarkably broad
                    archive, ranging from one of the earliest American novels, Susannah Rowson&apos;s <hi rend="i"
                        >Reuben and Rachel</hi> (1798), through antebellum historical romances, dime westerns, magazine
                    fiction, the silent films discovered in the <placeName>
                        <region type="province" key="tgn_7005806" reg="Yukon Territory">Yukon</region>
                    </placeName>, and twentieth-century writings of the Native American Renaissance. Brown argues that
                    &quot;the figure of the mixed-blood ... provides a mirror in which we might observe and
                    interpret changes in the way we view ourselves as a nation&quot; (p. 246). The fundamental shift
                    from the eighteenth century to the twenty-first was a move to &quot;revise the concept of
                    hybridity from biological terms to cultural terms&quot; (p. 157). As a result of this cultural
                    turn, &quot;the nation&apos;s counternarratives have become its master narratives .... The
                    subaltern has not only spoken, but it has usurped the dominant discourse and shattered the idols-the
                    vanishing Indian, the uncrossed hero, the undefiled white maiden-that were once
                    unassailable&quot; (p. 245). It is an interesting argument, and although the book could
                    certainly engage more fully the work of other scholars, <hi rend="i">Injun Joe&apos;s Ghost</hi>
                    asks fascinating questions about mixed-blood Indians and offers a wide range of literary sources for
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>Although Brown uses the figure of the ghost, he does not give much thought to the metaphor. Neither
                    does Sayre. But both books are haunted nonetheless. Brown accords mixed-blood Indians the power to
                    &quot;haunt us to death&quot; (p. 15). More explicitly, Sayre muses that &quot;the
                    question that haunts my crossbreed off-spring of literary genre studies and Native American
                    ethnohistory is whether the literary expressions of the Indian tragic heroes actually con- vey
                    anything of Native American experience&quot; (p. 34). These questions haunt every scholarly work
                    that focuses on Native Americans in American literature, history, and culture; in facing them, Brown
                    and Sayre introduce us to fascinating archives, ask exciting new questions, and offer some startling
                    answers. Brown tells us that the dialectics of racialism are subsiding, and that the new culturalism
                    will make mixed blood Indians central rather than spectral. Sayre shows that a cultural studies
                    approach uniting disparate theories, images, histories, and a vast range of texts can offer new
                    insight into the past and perhaps allow particular his- <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-103-2-098"/> torical
                    human beings such as Pontiac to emerge from the veils of nationalist mythology that have almost
                    completely obscured them.</p>

                <p>Mark Neely&apos;s twelfth book proposes to locate the boundaries between political and private
                    life during the Civil War era. Originally presented as a series of lectures at Pennsylvania State
                    University in 2002, <hi rend="i">The Boundaries of American Political Culture</hi> responded to
                    arguments by social historians that politics played only a marginal role in the daily lives of
                    nineteenth-century Americans. The author finds that during the Civil War era, engagement between
                    political and private life was without parallel.</p>
                <p>Neely&apos;s highly original analysis of the boundaries of political culture depends on his use
                    of a wide range of often-overlooked popular cultural evidence. He examines, for example, political
                    material found in the home, such as lithographs, paintings, newspapers, and photographs, as well as
                    political material found in public areas, like cartoons and posters. In connecting politics to
                    everyday life, Neely also explores partisan use of minstrel shows and other forms of entertainment
                    to deliver political messages to the public. Additionally, he analyzes the role of Union Leagues in
                    fundraising and in engaging individuals in politics through club activities. In contrast to Glenn C.
                    Altschuler and Stuart M. Blumin&apos;s contention that political activities in
                    nineteenth-century <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                    </placeName> were largely ignored by common Americans, Neely finds considerable overlap between the
                    public and private spheres of everyday life, and contends that politics, while not all-consuming,
                    certainly pervaded the daily lives of most Americans.</p>
                <p>One of the strengths of Neely&apos;s study is his creative use of cultural material and
                    artifacts, resources not always fully explored by political historians. For example, Neely finds
                    that many commercially produced small folio lithographic prints-which were clearly intended to be
                    hung in the home-depicted political figures and <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-103-2-099"/> images. He
                    illustrates his point with an analysis of a print of &quot;Henry Clay&quot;-an engraving by
                    Henry Sadd, based on a portrait by John W. Dodge-and concludes that hanging a picture in the home, a
                    private act, was by no means separate from political partisanship. Such pictures reflected the
                    extent to which politics intertwined with the private lives of Americans.</p>
                <p>Another example of Neely&apos;s creative use of cultural resources appears in his fascinating
                    analysis of popular entertainment. While acknowledging his debt to Jean Baker&apos;s <hi
                        rend="i">Affairs of Party</hi> (1998), Neely closely examines minstrel entertainment and
                    concludes that even popular culture could not completely ignore political culture. Equally
                    important, according to Neely, common people in the era of the Civil War were unembarrassed by
                    public political identification, an indication not only of the respectability of political
                    identification but also of the pervasiveness of politics in the social lives of everyday Americans.</p>
                <p>Resting upon evidence often overlooked by political historians, Neely steers the reader through an
                    intriguing and insightful intellectual journey. Despite the book&apos;s grand purpose and
                    fascinating approach, however, the boundaries of American political culture remain elusive, no
                    matter how finely Neely parses his arguments. Although Neely has not settled the debate about
                    political culture during the Civil War era, he has succeeded in expanding it by raising new
                    questions and opening fresh fields of inquiry.</p>

                    Confederacy (UDC), Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), Woman&apos;s Relief Corp (WRC),
                    and the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) from Reconstruction to the 1930s. The gendered
                    conceptions of nationalism that characterized such groups&apos; missions grew from beliefs that
                    women were morally superior, that their political activism was &quot;essential to
                    nation-building,&quot; and that they were &quot;creators of culture, in the sense of
                    everyday life and attitudes&quot; (p. 3). These values led women nationalists to challenge some
                    sexual hierarchies, but not to confront <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-103-2-100"/> women&apos;s
                    exclusion from direct participation in the political process. By glorifying &quot;men&apos;s
                    sacrifices on battle-fields as the highest form of patriotism,&quot; Morgan asserts, gendered
                    nationalism &quot;reinforced women&apos;s official exclusion from military service and
                    therefore from first-class citizenship&quot; (p. 4).</p>
                <p>Morgan substantively addresses race by detailing NACW&apos;s &quot;civic
                    nationalist&quot; efforts to foreground the patriotism of black men, to educate blacks about
                    heroes of their own race, and to question the meaning of citizenship in a Jim Crow society. Although
                    NACW became more masculinist in the twentieth century, its members never abandoned the idea of
                    women&apos;s cultural authority nor conflated patriotism with unquestioning allegiance to the
                    state. Morgan also furthers understanding of the intersections of race and women&apos;s
                    nationalism by revealing how their commitment to whiteness made the DAR, UDC, and even WRC complicit
                    in the triumph and domination of Jim Crow throughout the nation. The WRC, formed to provide relief
                    for Union veterans, was multiracial in its origins, but its white leaders ignored contributions of
                    black southerners to Union victory, sought &quot;loyal&quot; people among white southerners,
                    and, by the end of the century, increasingly embraced racialized definitions of national patriotism.
                    The UDC, which promoted neo-Confederate nationalism, erected countless statues and created Southern
                    patriotic rituals to memorialize fallen Confederates and the Lost Cause. Opposed to woman suffrage
                    and allied with white male Democrats, UDC women were not, Morgan argues, pawns of white male
                    politicians, but agents in the expansion of Jim Crow and valorization of the Confederacy. Sectional
                    reconciliation was possible, they believed, only when others recognized that respect for Confederate
                    patriotism was an essential component of national patriotism.</p>
                <p>The DAR, Morgan explains, promoted state-based nationalism because it sought to increase
                    &quot;loyalty to the nation, embodied by the state-the federal government and its laws&quot;
                    (p. 43). Unlike the UDC and NACW, which held ambivalent attitudes toward the state, the DAR
                    recognized &quot;no tension between state and nation&quot; (p. 47). Formed in 1890, it
                    required members to document white ancestral support for the American Revolution and to demonstrate
                    that they were acceptable to the existing membership-stipulations ensuring a membership of
                    higher-class white women. The DAR encouraged white women&apos;s political activism and fostered
                    women&apos;s cultural authority, but by evaluating women on the basis of their relationships
                    with men, and by endorsing male-only state-based nationalism, Morgan argues, the organization
                    reified the existing sexual hierarchy.</p>
                <p>World War I and the Russian Revolution proved pivotal in transforming the relationship between gen-
                        <pb n="217" id="VAA4025-103-2-101"/> der and nationalism. White women volunteer nationalists
                    surrendered cultural and moral authority to men as the state and its professional agents joined
                    their efforts during the war. In the postwar period, the women-centered nationalist groups,
                    including the DAR, supported reforms for women and children and called for international peace and
                    cooperation, but the DAR turned abruptly to the right in 1923 when an extreme rightist clique,
                    radicalized by the war and Russian Revolution, seized control of the organization. The DAR now
                    opposed any governmental role in domestic reform, but supported the creation of a strong national
                    security state.</p>
                <p>Morgan concludes that despite differences in their definitions of nation, all of the women
                    nationalists fostered &quot;pronounced masculine turns within their respective
                    ideologies&quot;-turns that followed the lead of such disparate models as &quot;the U.S.
                    military, federal surveillance agencies, the historical profession, the NAACP, and the charismatic
                    Marcus Garvey&quot; (p. 128). Morgan&apos;s deft treatment of four organizations over
                    several decades provides readers with a richly nuanced and complicated history of the rise and fall
                    of women-centered nationalism.</p>

                <p>Kinney&apos;s first chapter surveys the many changes that carriage manufacturing and marketing
                    underwent from the mid-eighteenth century to the end of the nineteenth century, when automobiles
                    began to displace horse-drawn carriages. He follows with detailed accounts of carriage making before
                    the Civil War, the industrialization of the trade in the years that followed, and the complex
                    relationship between vertical and horizontal modes of manufacture. In the former, manufacturers
                    fabricated and assembled all parts of a vehicle; in the latter, independent suppliers provided
                    manufacturers with parts, which the manufacturer then assembled into finished carriages.</p>
                <p>Integrating the complex history of organizational, manufacturing, and marketing change that carriage
                    makers faced in the nineteenth century are two chapters devoted, respectively, to New
                    England&apos;s and <placeName>

                    </placeName> Studebaker brothers. The story of the first shows how one family generated great wealth
                    from its manufacturing success and survived challenges posed by the passenger train, the streetcar,
                    and the bicycle, even though filial conflict split the firm. The Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing
                    Company was longer-lived than the Brewster firms, making the transition to auto manufacturing more
                    successfully than did all other carriage manufacturers. Kinney&apos;s dual narratives are
                    lively, detailed, and interesting, providing structure and coherency to a long, complex, and
                    detailed book.</p>
                <p>The book&apos;s final chapters examine the impact of industrialization on workers and the
                    carriage makers&apos; response to the advent of automobiles and trucks. In his epilogue, Kinney
                    restates the book&apos;s principal motifs: &quot;Unlike so many other trades where the
                    factory swept away the small shop, however, the industrialization of wagon and carriage manufacture
                    actually gave the old shop a new lease on life. The interchangeable parts flowing from the large
                    accessory factories permitted minimally capitalized small firms to successfully assemble and market
                    wagons and car- riages in competition with the large mass producers&quot; (p. 300).</p>
                <p>Nine tables and twenty seven images-all well-designed and well- chosen-complement the text, as do a
                    glossary and bibliographic essay. The glossary is especially welcome because few readers will know
                    either the taxonomy of horse-drawn vehicles or the names of carriage parts. At the same time, by
                    being separated from the text, such technical terms do not hinder readers uninterested in them-just

                    carriage succumbed to truck and automobile together. Historians have, in effect, half the story of
                    this early mode of transportation, although it could not be better done.</p>

                <p>In<hi rend="i">Birth of a Salesman</hi>, Walter Friedman traces the history of salesmanship in the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U. S.</country>
                    </placeName> from the itinerant peddlers of the early 1800s to the media strategists of our own
                    time. In this systematic, yet lively and energetic history, Friedman argues that &quot;the
                    &apos;visible hand&apos; of management, to borrow a phrase from historian Alfred D.
                    Chandler, Jr., could not have succeeded in many industries without the &apos;visible
                    handshake&apos; of a team of salesmen out on the road&quot; (p. 7). Historians typically
                    disdain the idea of studying sales: it reeks of manipulation and crass consumerism. But Friedman
                    shows that many useful products-from lightning rods to adding machines to serious books- might never
                    have succeeded on the market had they not been promoted door-to-door by persuasive peddlers and
                    bought by farmers and townsfolk who discovered value in what they were purchasing.</p>
                <p>Many of the principles of modern sales, as the author shows, were developed by door-to-door salesmen
                    in the 1800s. For example, Mark Twain&apos;s sales force used peer pressure and appeals to
                    vanity to sell over 300,000 copies of President Grant&apos;s Memoirs (1886). The risk-adverse
                    nature of farmers offered peddlers the clues they needed to devise effective means of marketing
                    lightning rods. Friedman argues that the emergence of the mail-order business, the department store,
                    and national magazines- all emphasizing national markets-led to the decline, but not the fall, of
                    such peddling strategies. Twentieth-century products, such as office machines and vacuum cleaners,
                        <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-103-2-104"/> proved better sold door-to-door because prospects needed to
                    see the product in action before they discovered their desire to buy it.</p>
                <p>By the 1920s, with the increased dominance of national advertising, executives learned the art of
                    selling from a growing array of books and classes. Friedman does a fine job investigating how such
                    standardized sources helped to convince sellers of cars, furniture, and washing machines to move
                    toward installment buying. The Great Depression, of course, devastated business, but here too
                    Friedman finds innovation and adaptability; as in the case of the Coca Cola Company, which succeeded
                    by investing in hundreds of Coca Cola servicemen who helped control product quality in 100,000 soda
                    fountains throughout the country.</p>
                <p>The increased authority of government in the 1930s changed strategies in selling. An appeal to a
                    politician might be worth a thousand appeals to consumers. IBM&apos;s Thomas J. Watson, for
                    example, supported FDR in politics and Roosevelt supported IBM in securing the punch-card business
                    for the new Social Security program and for military work during World War II. No wonder salesmen at
                    IBM conventions sang &quot;You&apos;re Our Leader Fine&quot; to Watson with such vigor!</p>
                <p>Friedman often writes with irony. &quot;Salespeople themselves are disliked,&quot; he writes,
                    but &quot;[t]he logic of salesmanship is relentless&quot; (p. 267). Sales has been a large
                    part of American economic growth because people respond to it. They decide they want the products
                    even if they often dislike the methods used to sell them. Friedman has written a fine book and it
                    deserves a wide reading.</p>

                <p>Arguing that the commercialization of American childhood preceded the rise of &quot;the
                    television age and post-war affluence&quot; (p. 1), Lisa Jacobson asserts that the child
                    consumer played an important role in the early decades of the twentieth century. Children, as the
                    bearers of modernity, gained authority and autonomy through their participation in the increasingly
                    powerful consumer capitalism of the 1920s and 1930s when a growing <pb n="221"
                        id="VAA4025-103-2-105"/> emphasis on the fulfillment of personal desire altered the nature of
                    family relationships, moral authority, and social hierarchies. By examining children&apos;s
                    position in American consumer society, <hi rend="i">Raising Consumers</hi> locates
                    children&apos;s place at the center of American history by demonstrating their influence on the
                    marketplace as well as on the family and the home.</p>
                <p>Early in the twentieth century, advertisers identified children as prospective allies in
                    manufacturers&apos; efforts to sell household products to American families and as a lucrative
                    market segment in and of themselves. During the 1920s and 1930s, in particular, educators and
                    childrearing authorities effectively changed their objective in financial education for children;
                    rather than stressing children&apos;s role as savers, school programs and parental advice
                    literature encouraged parents to train their children to become savvy consumers. Their message often
                    bore a distinctly middle-class quality; they encouraged parents to set up elaborate playrooms for
                    their children in order to facilitate development and creativity, and they advised the distribution
                    of weekly allowances to teach financial responsibility. Advertisements and promotions played into
                    these educational ideals, suggesting that young boys might develop &quot;masculine&quot;
                    characteristics-reason, entrepreneurial ambition, and intelligence-to enhance their consumer role.
                    This ideal young consumer-always male, white, and middle-class-had a sense for business and could
                    advise his parents on major household purchases.</p>
                <p>Despite adults&apos; efforts to shape consumerism&apos;s influence, the increased
                    significance of peer relationships tremendously affected the role of consumerism in
                    children&apos;s lives. Jacobson points to the importance of advertising-filled magazines
                    published by groups such as the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Campfire Girls. Merit badges might be
                    earned through the use of nationally branded products, and scouts might impress their friends by
                    using these products. Children participated in contests featured in other such publications, and
                    advertisers courted their brand loyalty with promises of prizes and group belonging. As children
                    entered adolescence, their ability to afford a multitude of other products and activities-ranging
                    from clothing and cosmetics to movies and dances-further shaped their peer relations. Jacobson does
                    well to address the adolescent specifically, but she does so somewhat irregularly. The reader
                    sometimes questions differences in consumer attitudes among children of various ages; greater
                    attention to this variation would have been a welcome addition to Jacobson&apos;s analysis.</p>
                <p>Even as Jacobson focuses primarily on the middle-class child, her work sets the stage for future
                    research that might engage more fully race-, class-, and region-based differences in consumption
                    patterns. Perhaps Jacobson&apos;s greatest contribution to the <pb n="222"
                        id="VAA4025-103-2-106"/> historiography of consumerism is her description of a middle ground
                    between ideas of children as either victims of marketing and media or totally autonomous purchasers.
                    Rather than locating power entirely in the hands of business, media, parents, or children,
                    Jacobson&apos;s history emphasizes the complex interactions among these groups. This analysis
                    contributes to our historical understanding of both the child consumer and American consumerism more
                    broadly.</p>

                <p>Robert H. Ferrell&apos;s two new books explore topics that he has studied for decades: the
                    qualities that distinguish the American presidency in general and the career and reputation of Harry
                    S. Truman in particular. I have had the pleasure and honor of knowing Ferrell for nearly 20 years,
                    ever since I took his diplomatic history course at Indiana University in the spring of 1987. I
                    remember him saying then that people would eventually come around to his view of Truman as one of
                    the top two presidents (the other being Lincoln) in <placeName>

                    </placeName> history. To the extent that they have, that shift in reputation may owe much to
                    Ferrell&apos;s own prolific writings on the man: writing done, as I later learned, through a
                    diligent regimen that included placing a towel under the door of his seventh-floor Ballantine Hall
                    office each morning so that no one could see that he was there working.</p>
                <p>Ferrell&apos;s latest two books are of interest to anyone who has followed his work over the
                    years. <hi rend="i">Presidential Leadership</hi> includes well-written essays on Woodrow Wilson,

                    manufacture black powder by mishandling relations with the DuPont Company. Wilson was ill-fitted for
                    the role of commander-in-chief, the author maintains, since he-to put it in the parlance of young
                    Bill Clinton-loathed the military. Regarding Harding, Ferrell sees an outright conspiracy-if that is
                    not too strong a word-to destroy the late president&apos;s reputation. Nan Britton&apos;s
                    claim that Harding had fathered her son, another author&apos;s claim (later repudiated) that
                    Harding was poisoned, and the scandals, which Ferrell does not see as particularly weighty, all
                    worked to degrade people&apos;s estimation of the twenty-ninth president. Ferrell also looks at
                    the various &quot;debunkers&quot; of Harding including the Sage of Balti- more, H. L.
                    Mencken. Coolidge, the legendarily terse Vermonter, was an uptight man who suppressed his anger in
                    public, only to blow up in private with his family. Despite these unattractive personal qualities,
                    Ferrell writes, the White House during the Coolidge era was a pleasant place to visit.</p>
                <p>The Garraty interview is a <hi rend="i">tour d&apos;horizon</hi> of American foreign policy from
                    1919 to 1945 that covers the League of Nations, interwar isolationism, the Stimson Doctrine,
                    Roosevelt&apos;s intentions vis-a-vis the Japanese prior to Pearl Harbor, and new left
                    revisionism, among other topics. The final essay deals with Ferrell&apos;s favorite subject-and
                    favorite president-Truman. Ferrell touts the thirty-third president for transform- ing an
                    isolationist country that sporadically intervened in European affairs into a nation perpetually
                    engaged with the world.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="i">Harry Truman and the Cold War Revisionists</hi>, Ferrell turns explicitly to cold war
                    historiography. Ferrell has written about the revisionists before: his essay in Richard
                    Kirkendall&apos;s <hi rend="i">The Truman Period as a Research Field: A Reappraisal</hi> (1972)
                    effectively demolished the revisionists as a group. A major culprit now, as was then, is Gar
                    Alperovitz, the historian who concluded that Truman ordered atomic bombs dropped on <placeName>

                    </placeName> solely to intimidate the Russians-an accusation Ferrell shows to be baseless. Noting
                    the socialist sentiments that motivated many of the revisionists, he adds that most were in any case
                    too young to have remembered the outbreak of World War II. He points out the contradiction of the
                    revisionists who argue that economic forces made the cold war inevitable but then assert that it
                    might have been avoided had certain voices been heeded. Ferrell takes revisionists to task for their
                    sloppy and sometimes even deceptive methodology, their citation of irrelevant documents, and their
                    mistaken assertion that Truman reversed Franklin Roosevelt&apos;s foreign policy toward the
                    Soviets when he assumed office. The author also demonstrates that <placeName>
