                    </placeName> in February of 1918 to elect a new national chairman for the party. The country was in
                    the midst of a great war, but war could not keep the party professionals from planning the 1918
                    congressional campaign. The Republicans had been out of power since the presidential inauguration of
                    1913: Woodrow Wilson was in the White House, and Democrats also controlled both houses of Congress.
                    Five years was longer than Republicans had spent so completely out of power since <placeName>

                    </placeName> had been inaugurated in 1861, and party leaders— world war or no world
                    war—were desperate to win an election. To win, the party would have to overcome the
                    normal patriotic support of a wartime administration and the appeals of President Wilson for a
                    nonpartisan campaign in 1918. But more important for the professionals, if the Republicans were to
                    win, the breach that had torn the party apart in 1912 and had only been partially healed in 1916
                    would have to be completely mended.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>In 1912 Theodore Roosevelt, the energetic Republican ex-President, had led a group of disgruntled
                    followers out of the Republican convention and formed a new Progressive party whose symbol had been
                    a big bull moose. Roosevelt, as the nominee of the Bull Moose Progressives, had campaigned against
                    Republican President William Howard Taft and Democrat Woodrow Wilson. The result had been a split in
                    the normal Republican vote—and the election of Wilson.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The progressives who had formed a party around Roosevelt in 1912 were only part of a much larger
                    group of people, both in and out of politics, who were trying to adjust American attitudes and
                    American political and governmental institutions to the forces of industrial change, urban growth,
                    and agricultural decline that had developed in the United States since the end of the Civil War. In
                    the first decade of the twentieth century the progressive movement, as it came to be called,
                    included urban political reformers, social workers, agricultural reformers, labor leaders,
                    conservationists, big businessmen, journalists, and an increasing number of young political leaders.
                    Both major parties had reacted slowly to progressivism, but the accident of an assassin's

                    century and encouraged the growth of progressivism within the Republican party. During
                    Roosevelt's presidency (1901-1909), young progressives had made their careers and
                    established their political bases in the Republican party on platforms involving political reform
                    (direct election of senators, initiative, referendum, and direct primary),
                    "trust-busting," the reduction of the uncontrolled power of big business, economic
                    regulation through commissions of trained experts, increased executive leadership at all levels of
                    government, stronger national government, conservation of resources, and humanitarianism.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the progressive politicians rose from local and state to national office, they found themselves
                    increasingly in conflict with entrenched political leaders backed, in many cases, by entrenched
                    economic interests. In the Democratic party, the progressives made adjustments to some of the older
                    leadership groups, most notably those around William Jennings Bryan. In the Republican party,
                    however, both the structure of the "old guard"—a cooptive group based
                    in the Senate and jealous of its power—and the verbal encouragement of President
                    Roosevelt tended to heighten the progressives' consciousness of themselves as a different
                    and "better" group within the party with their own identity and their own
                    programs. So long as he was President and effective leader of the Republican party, Roosevelt was
                    able—by deft manipulation, cajolery, and occasional use of the "big
                    stick"—to keep the progressives and the old guard from coming to blows.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Roosevelt's hand-picked successor, William Howard Taft (1909–1913), was not so
                    deft. Although an able administrator, Taft was not an effective party leader. On issues crucial to
                    them, Taft alienated the progressives in his party. He also alienated—and then
                    infuriated—Roosevelt, who, in his fifties and still bouncingly energetic, found it
                    unbearable to be absent from the center of power. Roosevelt campaigned against Taft in the
                    Republican primaries in 1912, won most of them, but did not win the convention. He then formed his
                    own party.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Progressive party never, even at its inception, included all the Republican progressives, nor did
                    it include all the progressive-minded people in the country. Wilson, himself a Democratic
                    progressive, appealed not only to like-minded people in his own party but to some independents and
                    Republican progressives as well. (Progressive Republican Senator Robert La <list type="footnotes">

                    party of one mind. Some liked the party's strong, idealistic platform but distrusted its
                    candidate and his followers. There were those who backed Roosevelt but had grave doubts about the
                    progressive program. There were others who liked both. After the loss of the election of 1912, some
                    factions—notably those who disliked Roosevelt and his men— left the party.
                    After disastrous losses in the local elections in 1914, more splinter groups and individual leaders
                    deserted. By 1916, except for the ardent followers of Roosevelt—and even they were
                    divided—the Bull Moose party had fallen apart.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Roosevelt was still eager for power. He tried to use the remnants of the Progressive party and the
                    threat of another break with the Republicans to bargain his way to the Republican nomination in
                    1916. He lost. Charles Evans Hughes, associate justice of the Supreme Court and former progressive
                    governor of Roosevelt's own state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, was nominated. The old guard Republican leadership, more firmly entrenched in the
                    control of the party machinery since Roosevelt and his progressive followers had bolted, did not
                    trust the former President. They had nominated Hughes because he was a mild progressive who had been
                    neutral in 1912 (due to his position on the Supreme Court). They hoped Hughes would bring the
                    progressive voters back to the Republican fold, and with them would come the power the party had
                    lost in 1912.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hughes failed, although the election was a close one. Many Republican leaders blamed the loss on the
                    Bull Moose Progressives, who had not been very enthusiastic in their support of Hughes despite the
                    fact that the Progressive party organization had endorsed him and the campaign had been run by a
                    joint Progressive-Republican committee. With the Republicans' defeat, the old guard leaders
                    decided to get rid of Hughes' men, including William R. Willcox, the national chairman.
                    They wanted to put in men acceptable to the old guard and to run the party as they wished. The
                    progressive Republicans, particularly the old Bull Moosers, wanted "real"
                    progressives in control of the Republican organization, not "luke-warm" Hughes
                    progressives. They wanted to take over the Republican party, having failed with their own party, and
                    make it a truly progressive organization. Roosevelt still wanted another Republican nomination, and
                    some of his devoted followers wanted men favorable to him—whatever their feelings about
                    progres- sivism—in control of the Republican party. There were, too, some young <list type="footnotes">

            <p>These were the groups who met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> early in 1918 to elect a new Republican national chairman. These were the interests the
                    new chairman would have to reconcile if the Republicans were to win the Congress in 1918 and the
                    presidency in 1920.</p>
            <p>The fight for control of the Republican organization started soon after the 1916 election was lost.
                    Losing an election is always a blow to the power and prestige of a national chairman, and if he is
                    not strongly backed by the professionals and the party leadership groups, his position is difficult
                    at best. Chairman Willcox found himself attacked from all sides after November, 1916, and to try to
                    bring some solution to the problem he called the executive committee of the national committee to
                    meet after New Years Day, 1917.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among those invited to the Republican executive committee meeting were two men who were still
                    officially members of the Progressive party: George W. Perkins, the chairman of the Bull Moose party
                    and the man who, next to Roosevelt, was symbolic of that party and all it meant to the Republican
                    professionals; and Everett Colby, Perkins' colleague on the Progressive party staff. They
                    were invited because they had been members of the joint Progressive-Republican campaign committee
                    and because the Republicans felt they represented not only the progressives but also Roosevelt and
                    his ambitions.</p>
            <p>Perkins was a former partner in the J. P. Morgan and Company bank. His offer of financial backing had
                    enabled Roosevelt to make the decision to form his own party in 1912. Since that time Perkins had
                    been Roosevelt's "right-hand man" and chairman of the Progressive
                    party's executive committee. He had managed Roosevelt's effort to capture the 1916
                    Republican nomination, and after that failed, he had taken on himself the task of easing the Bull
                    Moosers officially back into the Republican party and using their strength to help Roosevelt get the
                    1920 Republican nomination. The Republican regulars seemed to regard Perkins as a necessary, but
                    evil, part of the workings of the Republican executive committee.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the Republican committee meeting in January, 1917, Perkins planned to negotiate the formal reentry
                    of the Progressives into the GOP and to try to get official progressive representation on Republican
                    party councils. The old guard on the executive committee intended to get Chairman Willcox to resign.
                    Failing that, they planned to assure a regular Republican successor <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>The executive committee meeting was nearly a total success for the Republican regulars. They did not
                    force Willcox out, but they elected a vice chairman, obviously intended to be his successor. They
                    tied Willcox' hands by putting the power to decide all matters of "publicity,
                    finance, and expense" jointly in the hands of the chairman, the new vice chairman, and the
                    treasurer. The vice chairman, John T. Adams of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, were both old guard regulars. They could therefore control Willcox and suppress any
                    progressive influence on the national organization.</p>
            <p>Perkins did not even get a chance to present his plan for the reconciliation of the progressives. The
                    vice chairmanship was the committee's first order of business, and upon <placeName>

                    </placeName>' election, Perkins and Colby left the meeting in a huff. Later in the evening
                    they issued a joint denunciation of the committee's action to the press and appealed to
                    progressive leaders across the country for support.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The progressives rallied to Perkins, but their support was not altogether enthusiastic. In general,
                    they did not think there was any "prospect of concessions being made by the old line
                    organization." One of them wrote Perkins: "I feel that the Republican Organization
                    is utterly hopeless from our point of view." Most progressives agreed, and most of them
                    felt Perkins had made a tactical error in trying to negotiate with the Republican leadership at all.
                    They were not surprised he had failed.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    "eastern" leadership of the Progressive party organization around Perkins. These
                    westerners had early banded together on the basis of a common love of Roosevelt, a dislike of
                    Perkins, and an effort to control the direction of the Progressive party. They had cooperated with
                    Perkins and his group in public in order to maintain party unity. They had worked hard to help the
                    progressive cause in the 1916 campaign. After that campaign they had published a program for
                    progressives, calling for a national conference and <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Perkins' eastern group of leaders had little direct contact with progressive voters. Their
                    influence depended largely upon their close relationship with Roosevelt. So long as he needed them
                    they were powerful. Of the entire group Perkins himself was the man closest to Roosevelt and the man
                    with the least personal political power. In the attempt to reenter the Republican organization,
                    these men felt they could not afford to demand, but rather had to negotiate carefully and quietly
                    for place in the Republican machinery. They could not flaunt progressive strength because there was
                    no assurance that that strength would be behind them if their bluff were called.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The western progressive group felt it could use progressive voting strength as a bludgeon if
                    necessary to back up their demands for place, power, and ultimately control in the national
                    Republican organization. Most of the progressive voting strength, and all of the progressive
                    strength in local Republican party organizations, was concentrated in the Middle and Far West. The
                    westerners felt themselves to be the natural leaders of that strength. After what they felt was the
                    failure of compromising with the old guard Republicans in the 1916 campaign, they wanted to get rid
                    of "eastern" control, "take the initiative," and bring about a
                    "new deal" which was to be a "Western deal." Even before Perkins
                    met with the Republican committee, they had made plans and started projects without his knowledge
                    and had speculated on how to get rid of him.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Perkins failed with the Republicans, the westerners jumped at their chance. One of them went to
                    demand his resignation as chairman of the executive committee. Perkins proved
                    "difficult" and refused to resign. Ickes appealed to Roosevelt on behalf of the

                            decided to call a national progressive conference over the objections of Perkins and
                            Roosevelt. Harold L. Ickes to Gifford Pinchot, July 8, November 11, December 21, 1916;

                    order to "indicate that every progressive movement was not a Perkins movement."
                    Perkins' effort to win "by indirect and secret means" what the westerners
                    wanted to win "by open challenge"—namely control of the Republican
                    party—had destroyed all progressive confidence in him. Ickes wrote: "The
                    progressives… are not interested in dickering for representation of their
                    leaders…. The progressives want a big issue. They don't want to compromise with
                    the old guard; they want to throw them out; they don't want to divide control; they want to
                    take control…." The westerners, Ickes concluded, were going to drop Perkins. It
                    would be well, he thought, if Roosevelt did too. The "petty political row" Perkins
                    had started with the Republicans, he warned, might well prove fatal to Roosevelt's hopes
                    for the nomination in 1920.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately for Ickes and his friends the coming of World War I to America submerged their dispute
                    with Perkins. Having taken a private stand against him, they were at a loss to do anything more. If
                    Roosevelt did not publicly kick Perkins out, the westerners would, as Pinchot remarked, find it
                    difficult "to make Progressives over the country understand in any statement we might issue
                    why we are opposing what Perkins is doing." Roosevelt did finally tell Perkins to let the
                    westerners go their own way, but the war had already intervened.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The war brought, too, a hiatus in the fight Perkins had started with the Republican executive
                    committee. Chairman Willcox refused to call a meeting of the full national committee, despite
                    pressure from Perkins, and the announced preliminary plans for the 1918 Republican campaign
                    completely ignored the progressives. Perkins' position vis-a-vis the Republican leadership
                    was increasingly weakened by Roosevelt's drift toward the regular Republicans, as well as
                    by the coolness of the other progressive leaders toward him.<hi rend="sup">198</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ickes, Perkins, and many of the other progressives quickly found themselves useful war work, and, for
                    a while, politics fell into the background. But by January, 1918, it was no longer possible for
                    politicians to ignore politics—a congressional campaign was about to begin. On January
                    11, 1918, Willcox sent out a call for a Republican national committee meeting to be held in <placeName>

            <p>Four days later Willcox resigned as chairman of the national committee. He left the choice of his
                    successor to the committee members. So confident were the old guard leaders that they controlled the
                    Republican machinery and would elect the new chairman that they invited the progressive members of
                    the 1916 joint Progressive-Republican committee to the <placeName>

                    "promoted" to Willcox' place. Perkins was informed that the two

                        <region type="county">Adams</region>
                    </placeName>. The regulars seemed to have the situation well in hand.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perkins could not have been surprised by Willcox' resignation or by the announcement that
                    Adams would succeed him. Nor had his strategy changed in the year since the Republican executive
                    committee had elected <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Adams</region>
                    </placeName> vice chairman. His desire was still to win a place for progressives. Now he decided to
                    concentrate his efforts on the national chairmanship because he thought he might win the fight for a
                    single place—even so important a place.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perkins' first move was to try to solidify the progressive strength behind him. The
                    progressive members of the 1916 campaign committee had been evenly divided between Perkins'
                    friends—Perkins, Colby, and Oscar S. Straus— and the western
                    group—Ickes, James Garfield, and Rowell. The westerners refused to support Perkins in his
                    new efforts. Rowell, recovering from an attack of typhus in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, refused even to come to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> meeting. "For fifty years," he wrote to Perkins, "the
                    Executive Committee of the Republican Party has been the governing body of the United States, and it
                    has been a self-perpetuating autocracy." It had proved itself
                    "invincible" in 1912 and again in 1916, and Rowell doubted that it would abdicate
                    "by its own consent," which was what would have to happen if the progressives were
                    to get any power on the national committee.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None of the westerners thought there was any chance to elect a really progressive national chairman.
                    They were loathe to spend their energies and their political capital fighting against a member of
                    the old guard. They wanted to fight for a progressive. They appealed to Roosevelt for advice, but he
                    had no desire for an open battle with the regulars and refused to give advice. Finally, only one
                    westerner, Ickes, went to the meeting at all; and although he maintained open opposition to Perkins,
                    so far as the public was concerned and so far as the old guard leaders could see, Perkins went to

            <p>Having gained at least the appearance of progressive support, Perkins threw down the gauntlet to the
                    old guard. He told Senator John W. Weeks of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, who was close to the old guard leaders, that the progressives intended to fight the

                        <region type="county">Adams</region>
                    </placeName>, and he threatened progressive defection from the Republicans if the "old line
                    members" of the leadership insisted on maintaining "complete control" of
                    the party. He mentioned no candidate for the chairmanship, but the man selected would, he said, have
                    to have "the ability to harmonize" and "the ability to organize"
                    if he were to gain his support and that of the progressives.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Senator Weeks replied that only two men had been mentioned for the national chairmanship: Will <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hays</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the young chairman of the Indiana Republican state committee, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Adams</region>
                    </placeName>, a man who had been a devoted, hard working member of the national committee for years,
                    who knew people all over the country, and who was "in a sense in line for
                    promotion." <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hays</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Weeks wrote off as "an excellent man," but one who might run for
                    governor of Indiana and one who, if he were elected chairman, might have to have "ample
                    compensation," a death-dealing blow considering the public prejudice against paid political
                    managers. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Adams</region>
                    </placeName>, Weeks said, was "likely to be selected." But at the same time the
                    progressives would not be neglected. It would be the purpose of "whoever is in charge of
                    the organization to try to induce" Perkins himself, Colby, and others "to become a
                    part of the working organization." Weeks told Perkins that "undoubtedly"
                    he and "Colonel Roosevelt could indicate whoever you thought desirable for that
                    connection." Given the possibility of naming their own representatives to the Republican
                    organization, it did not seem to Weeks that "there ought to be any quarrel over this matter
                    of the chairmanship" from Perkins, Roosevelt, or their supporters. The old guard was
                    willing to bend to pressure, but they had no intention of giving the chairmanship to anyone but a
                    man of their own choosing. The progressives were pushing too hard: "Nothing can be gained
                    by trying to demonstrate that we are not anxious for the success of the Republican party,"
                    Weeks lashed out, or "that we are inimical to sane, reasonable, and real
                    progress." The old guard leaders, he pointed out, "have the approval of the voters
                    of our own States." Furthermore, Weeks claimed that he himself had "actually been
                    insistent on more real liberal legislation than half the men in public life who pose as
                    progressives." The progressives could have their patronage, but they could not have the
                        chairmanship.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Hays</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been deliberate. By the end of January, 1918, it was clear that Hays was making a
                    strong bid for the chairmanship and that Perkins, and perhaps the progressive organization, might
                    well be quietly supporting him. So it must have seemed to Weeks and his old guard friends.</p>

                    was eliptical. It was part of the political game, and many of them played that game with great zest,
                    using simple codes, wearing disguises occasionally, making dashing, unannounced trips to mysterious
                    destinations, and scrawling "Personal and Confidential!!" across even the most
                    inconsequential letters to their colleagues. It was not proper to be seeking office; one had to be
                    "called." Efforts to win office had to be couched in terms that could immediately
                    be disclaimed. All the commonplace efforts which ambitious men make to achieve their
                    goals—all the pressures, the arm twisting and occasional blackmail, the influence sought
                    and brought to bear, the returning of favors, even the canvassing of votes—had to be
                    removed from the public eye and the public consciousness. Hays was a good politician, and no direct
                    record has been found concerning when he started to seek the office of Republican national committee
                    chairman. On record, there are—to the day he was elected and long
                    after—constant denials that he was seeking the office at all.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                    </placeName> first came to national attention during the Republican campaign of 1916 when his
                    Indiana organization carried the state for Hughes and the Republicans by a great majority in the
                    face of a general Democratic victory in the Midwest and the nation. Hays was a skillful organizer of
                    party workers and something of an innovator of modern campaign techniques (the
                    "citizens" committees and advisory groups of eminent public leaders for campaign
                    organizations). He had also very carefully brought the old Bull Moose Progressives back to the
                    Republican fold in Indiana by cooperating with their local organizations where they were powerful
                    and by dividing the higher offices in the state organization among the regular Republicans and the
                    progressives. He had, thereby, undercut the independent progressive organization in the state and at
                    the same time had "harmonized" the two wings of the Republican party into a
                    working unit. His efforts had brought recognition from the national Republican campaign organization
                    during the campaign, and some national publicity as well. There were progressives who were not happy
                    about his performance, perhaps out of disappointment that the progressive organization in Indiana
                    had succumbed so easily to blandishments of place, preferment, and prestige. Ickes, years later,
                    expressed best the progressive dislike of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hays</settlement>
                    </placeName> when he wrote that "considering the dollars that were poured into Indiana, the
                    campaign paraphernalia and the man power that were literally dumped into the Hoosier campaign [by
                    the national campaign committee], any second-rate precinct committeeman could have delivered it to

            </p>
            <p>The implication of the threat to Adams was harsh. If the progressives or Roosevelt or New could
                    establish the vice chairman's "pro-German" stand as a public fact, it
                    would ruin <placeName>

                    during the war were extremely suspicious of anyone suspected of friendly feelings toward the
                    Germans, past or present. Roosevelt, among many others, had put his enormous national prestige
                    behind a crusade for "Americanism" in the war—a viciously intolerant
                    crusade against differences of opinion about the war—and most of America followed.
                    Loyalty to America, as defined by super patriots such as Roosevelt had become, was for all but the
                    very strongest of political leaders something a man seeking office had constantly to prove. Certain

                    cast doubts upon my Americanism." Perkins made no public comment, but, the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> was careful to report: "the men closest to Colonel Roosevelt declined to
                    permit Perkins to speak for them." Roosevelt had no intention of publicly alienating <placeName>

            <p>Perkins was also attacked by the one other Bull Moose leader at the meeting. Ickes was disturbed at
                    Perkins' busy negotiations. He was trying to get a chairman who was satisfactory to himself
                    and, so far as Ickes knew, to Roosevelt. But he seemed to be making no effort to get any power for
                    the progressives, either on the national committee or anywhere else in the Republican organization.
                    When the executive committee initially voted to continue the old campaign advisory committee of
                    1916, it became obvious to Ickes that the progressives were scheduled to remain powerless advisors.</p>
            <p>Ickes held a news conference and demanded "actual, not ornamental" recognition for
                    the progressives. He said that the progressives of the west, whom he represented, were quite willing
                    to "enter an amalgamation" with the Republican party if the conditions of that
                    amalgamation were the disposal "simultaneously of… the old guard remnants and of
                    Perkins and the Progressive Party" headquarters group. Ickes doubted that such a deal would
                    be made, but he warned that the western progressives did not intend to accept less.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

                    </placeName> that he was "unavailable" for the chairmanship. He nominated <placeName>

                    "members of the Old Guard" that "George W. Perkins and his

                    instance, was virtually eliminated from politics.</p>
            <p>The morning after his election, Hays was warned by New that powerful old guard members of the Senate
                    had said that it would "not do to recognize George Perkins." Perkins received no
                    office, nor any public recognition, in the Republican organization from the new chairman. At the
                    same time Hays worked with Perkins privately and consulted him frequently about political matters.
                    Occasionally he did favors for Perkins. At Perkins' request he agreed, for example, shortly
                    after his election to prevent Ickes from getting any posts in the Republican organization.
                    Ickes' ultimate recognition as a valuable progressive Republican leader would have to come
                    from a Democratic president.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

                    Roosevelt the excuse. Shortly after the battle for the chairmanship, Perkins, in a fury, sent an
                    article from a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> paper to Roosevelt which said that King was Roosevelt's
                    "mouthpiece" and that Perkins had been eliminated. Perkins was vituperative about
                    King and demanded that Roosevelt not see him again. Roosevelt replied, from his hospital bed, quite
                    bluntly that "nobody is my mouthpiece" and that he would see anyone he wanted any
                    time he wanted. He made it clear to Perkins that he no longer represented him and that he was,
                    indeed, no longer needed at all.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was, for Roosevelt, the final act of cutting free of the Progressive party he had created. He
                    had made sure, in the years between 1914 and 1918, that the Bull Moose had died and that most of its
                    membership had returned to the Republican party. He had vigorously renewed his old friendships among
                    the regular Republican leaders. He had avoided contact with the western progressive group and denied
                    it any encouragement for a battle with the old guard or any sort of demonstration of progressive
                    strength and unity. He had, by using King and Perkins, obtained the election of a Republican
                    national chairman who was not inimical to his nomination to the presidency, without alienating the
                    old guard leaders.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Now he got rid of Perkins, who had alienated the old guard.
                    It is ironic that this act of preparation for the 1920 Republican nomination was performed from a
                    hospital bed. Although he recovered and left the hospital on this occasion, a year later, in
                    January, 1919, he again entered the hospital, where, quite unexpectedly (he delighted in doing the
                    unexpected) he died.</p>

                    had. "The old guard would have elected <placeName>

                    pro-German views." The Republican national committee was still "decidedly
                    reactionary." The progressives, now that the campaign advisory committee was done away
                    with, had no voice in Republican affairs at all. It was clear that the old guard would try to remove <placeName>

                    but trying to work with all, and organizing all factions on a large and public scale to work for
                    election victories for the Republican party made the obscurity thicker. He was neither progressive
                    nor old guard. He was indeed the man Perkins had specified, who could "harmonize"
                    and "organize." His work was cut out for him. He had the congressional campaign of
                    1918 to organize, and then the massive preparations necessary for the presidential campaign of 1920.
                    Prevented by the national committee from placing progressives on a campaign advisory committee, he
                    brought more than a hundred prominent progressive and regular leaders into harmony by having them
                    work together on a huge platform advisory committee prior to the 1920 convention. The Republican
                    party won control of the Congress in November, 1918, and Harding won the presidency by a landslide
                    in 1920—ample justification for the election of <placeName>

            <p>The formal opening of the new Indiana State Museum in the former <placeName>

                    </placeName> Hall in January, 1967, was a significant and promising milestone in Indiana museum
                    history. This event concluded a long delayed and much overdue effort to develop a museum which could
                    become important in reminding Hoosiers of their heritage from and obligations to past generations.
                    In 1869 the Indiana General Assembly enacted a law which provided "for the collection and
                    preservation of a Geological and Mineralogical Cabinet of the Natural History of this
                    State…." This enactment established a Department of Geology and Natural Science
                    under the control of the Indiana State Board of Agriculture. The department was placed in charge of
                    a state geologist to be appointed by the governor for a two-year term at a salary of
                    $1,800 annually. In addition to his duty "to complete a thorough geological
                    survey of the whole State as soon as consistent with his other duties…," he was
                    enjoined "to collect, properly label, and arrange in agricultural rooms, specimens of the
                    ores, coals, building stones, clays, soils, and organic remains; quadrupeds, birds, reptiles,
                    fishes, Crustacea, molusca [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], insects and all other objects of natural history
                    peculiar to the State, and as far as practicable, of other states and countries also."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Subsequent to this legislation, a museum was established in the old state capitol. It apparently
                    remained under the direction of the state geologist until 1945 when the Division of Geology (now the
                    Geological Survey) was moved from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to quarters on the campus of Indiana University at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At this time the museum was transferred to the Division of State Parks which, like the
                    office of the state geologist, had been a unit within the Indiana Department of Conservation since
                    1919. The museum has remained in the Division of State Parks since 1945.</p>
            <p>Between the 1870's and the 1940's the museum experienced many vicissitudes. The
                    early material which found its way into the museum's collections was principally geological
                    in nature, but as the decades passed an increasing number of Civil War souvenirs and miscellaneous
                    items were added. The museum seems to have been located in the capitol during these years, first in
                    the building erected in the 1830's and then in the present capitol which was completed in
                    the 1880's. For many years it was situated on the third floor; but about 1919, when the
                    Indiana Department of Conservation was established, it was moved to the basement. As the decades
                    passed, inadequate attention was given to the protection and preservation of items with the result
                    that numerous specimens disappeared or became unusable. The location in the basement of the capitol
                    after 1919 was particularly unattractive, dingy, and conducive to vandalism. Despite its rather
                    noble beginnings with <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>The geological emphasis remained basic as regards content of the museum's collections. In
                    1880 an official report indicated that there was then a total of 20,551 "specimens of every
                    description in the State Museum…," including thousands of "fossils,
                    shells, corals and crinoids…." Of these items, 2,040 were classified as Lower
                    Silurian; 1,550 as Devonian; 1,460 as Lower Carboniferous; 1,395 as Upper Silurian; and 919 as
                    Carboniferous. There were 505 "Arrow points, spears, etc."; 504 land and fresh
                    water shells; 300 "Minerals, including lithological specimens"; and 186
                    "Natural history specimens in alcohol—Jars, etc." Miscellaneous items
                    included relics from mound-builders, perforated shell and slate ornaments, pipes, hand axes or
                    fleshers, copper beads and fragments of copper, hammer and anvil stones, fishing sinkers, Peruvian
                    water jugs, and an elephant's tooth. Roughly 2,000 items were unclassified, having come
                    from four individuals or from surveys in <placeName>

            <p>After decades of neglect, important steps were taken toward establishment of a new and modern state
                    museum during the administration of Governor Ralph F. Gates, 1945–1949. Governor Gates
                    and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Matter, director of the Indiana Department of Conservation, added staff members to the
                    Division of State Parks who were knowledgeable regarding the establishment and operation of
                        museums.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Under the direction of Governor Gates and Director Matter
                    information was assembled about museums, studies were made of possible sites for a museum building,
                    and drawings were made for a proposed building to be erected on the north side of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Street across from the Indiana State Library and Historical Building. Despite these
                    significant steps and related efforts, the museum remained in its dingy, dirty, and undesirable
                    quarters in the basement of the capitol. Nevertheless, though unable to overcome decades of neglect,
                    the Gates administration pointed the way toward augmented support and improved housing for the state
                    museum.</p>
            <p>As the functions and personnel of state government rapidly expanded during the 1940's and
                    1950's, space for offices became increasingly acute. As a consequence a new State Office
                    Building was constructed and occupied during 1960 and early 1961. While this construction was in
                    progress, the museum's collections—by then largely a hodgepodge of this and
                    that—were temporarily placed in storage along with other material which had not been
                    displayed, in part for lack of space.</p>

            <p>Discussion and planning for the new State Office Building inevitably raised the questions of what
                    would happen to the museum's holdings. Early in the administration of Governor Harold W.
                    Handley, 1957–1961, the legislature authorized a commission to examine the state museum,
                    inquire into museum programs in other states, and make "recommendations regarding the
                    future program and development of the Indiana State Museum" to the ensuing General
                        Assembly.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> This commission held its initial meeting in the fall of 1957 and
                    submitted its findings a year later. It recommended construction of a museum building on the site
                    originally proposed by the Gates administration. The commission reported that its members had
                    "been forced to the reluctant conclusion that Indiana has the poorest and most inadequate
                    State Museum in the United States."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> This report, for the moment at
                    least, was largely ignored. In 1960 a considerable amount of museum material was returned to a new
                    location in the basement of the capitol. Although this area was spruced up and better lighted than
                    that previously used, it was inappropriate and inadequate. In 1958 the Indiana State Museum Study
                    Commission had "unanimously concluded that, even if additional space should later become
                    available in the present Capitol building, it would be impossible either to develop or maintain an
                    effective museum program in such unsatisfactory quarters."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>The steps which resulted in the formal opening of the new Indiana State Museum in 1967 were commenced
                    during the administration of Governor Matthew E. Welsh, 1961–1965. Donald E. Foltz,
                    director of the Indiana Department of Conservation, was much interested in developing an appropriate
                    museum for the Hoosier State. With the approval and support of Governor Welsh, Director Foltz and
                    the staff of the Division of State Parks explored various possibilities. About this time, 1962, the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Hall became vacant as city offices were transferred to the new City-County Building.
                    Studies were made of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis City</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hall as a possible location for a museum. In November, 1963, the building was leased
                    for a nominal sum for museum purposes. This building—of classic Greek Ionic
                    design—was constructed of Indiana limestone and had been completed about 1911. Governor
                    Welsh and Director Foltz expressed the hope that the new museum could be opened in 1966 as a
                    contribution to Indiana's sesquicentennial of statehood.</p>
            <p>The further efforts required to adapt <placeName>

                    in 1965, and John E. Mitchell, director of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Both
                    Governor Branigin and Director <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>

                    Welsh and Branigin administrations—however, rested with Robert D. Starrett. Although the
                    museum was not formally opened until January, 1967, some attractive educational exhibits were
                    displayed as a contribution to the Indiana sesquicentennial in 1966. These initial exhibits
                    emphasized Indiana art, especially the paintings of Theodore C. Steele. Such an emphasis resulted
                    from the efforts of Governor Branigin, who arranged for the purchase of about forty paintings by
                    eight Indiana artists who portrayed the Indiana scene. Museum officials are hopeful that this
                    Indiana art collection will grow to become one of outstanding significance.</p>
            <p>The new Indiana State Museum is far from finished. In a very real sense such a museum is never
                    completed, for additional material constantly becomes available and exhibits must be changed from
                    time to time. Director Starrett has wisely emphasized that education is the basic function of the
                    museum but to realize this goal collections must first be assembled and "properly cared for
                    if they are to be of any use." To achieve its objectives the museum must collect and
                    preserve materials, do research, exhibit items, and interpret its collections.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                    Given a few more decades and continued personal interest of state officials; generous support for
                    staff, facilities, and acquisitions; freedom from partisan interference along with freedom to plan
                    and develop holdings and exhibits in a thoughtful manner; and the understanding and support of
                    Hoosiers generally, the Indiana State Museum can and should become of outstanding importance in
                    educational programs concerning Indiana's heritage.</p>
            <p>The Indiana State Museum has already developed interestingly displayed exhibits concerning Indiana
                    art, politics, natural history, geology, and Indians. The pictures which follow illustrate the
                    museum building and these varied exhibits. The photographs, taken by Philip <placeName>

            <p>The Indiana Museum Society was organized in April, 1967, to promote the development of the Indiana
                    State Museum for the benefit of the public. Certain members of the Junior League of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who cataloged the state collection as part of Indiana's sesquicentennial
                    observance of 1966, became acutely aware of serious gaps in the collection and initiated an
                    organization of private citizens to seek donations for it and at the same time to encourage broader
                    use of the museum. The society thus is a direct outgrowth of the Indiana sesquicentennial.</p>
            <p>Founders of the Indiana Museum Society realized that the state museum could be nurtured only if there
                    was concerted, statewide effort to undertake mutual exchanges of ideas, services, and exhibits with
                    other museums—local or metropolitan, private or public, specialized or general.
                    Accordingly, membership for the Indiana Museum Society is sought not just from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> but from throughout the state. It is hoped that in time a regional structure will be
                    set up so that museum activities at the local level can be further cultivated and the benefit of
                    local activities can in turn be made available to other parts of the state. The society hopes to
                    initiate a variety of programs to promote Indiana history. Programs under consideration include:
                    identifying and cataloging museum collections, methods of acquisition, exhibit development and
                    exchange, field trips, and museum training. Historical societies, educational groups, professional
                    and trade associations, and secondary and collegiate institutions will be asked to assist
                    implementation of these curatorial and educational functions.</p>
            <p>The immediate focus of the society, however, is the Indiana State Museum collection, which has a long
                    way to go before its bodies of natural and cultural history can in a select and meaningful way
                    represent evidence of the past. From experience in collecting materials for the state museum, the
                    society will be better qualified to offer services to others and in turn to understand local
                    problems in promoting the full spectrum of preservation.</p>
            <p>If the long standing disrepute of neglect which has severely limited public interest in the state
                    collection is to be overcome, the society is obliged to establish itself as an effective voice; and
                    this it has sought since its inception. So that there can be direct and continuing dialogue with
                    officials of the state administration, representatives of state governmen have been appointed to the
                    board of directors of the society in an ex officio capacity, with members of the Indiana Natural
                    Resources Commission and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources occupying five of the present
                    twenty chairs. Robert D. Starrett, director of the Indiana State Museum, also serves as executive

                    physical facilities and, more importantly, a qualified staff who can make full use of those
                    facilities. Altogether, the society has a sound base upon which to rest its operations.</p>
            <p>Not until 137 years after the founding of the Indiana Historical Society was a group organized along
                    similar lines to foster Indiana's cultural and natural history through the museum function.
                    It has now been done, however, and preservation of tangible evidence of the Hoosier past is being
                    sought— whatever its scope or quality—because a record of our existence is
                    needed. As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes is reputed to, have commented, "Continuity with
                    the past is not a duty, it is only a necessity."</p>

            <p>During Indiana's Sesquicentennial celebration the Indiana State Library conducted and
                    administered a statewide search for manuscripts relating to the state's 150 years of
                    historical development. Through this program, known as the Indiana Sesquicentennial Manuscript
                    Project, manuscripts were collected, and xerox or microfilm copies of them were distributed to a
                    number of libraries within the state. In June, 1968, the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History</hi> began publication of a guide to the collected manuscripts, as compiled by Thomas
                    Krasean, director of the project. Part I of the guide included entries in the categories of account
                    books; business records; church records; county and local history; diaries and journals; early
                    county records and documents; and part of the section on letters, papers, and documents. Following
                    is the concluding portion of the guide. Entries include the remainder of letters, papers, and
                    documents; military records; organizational minutes; reminiscences and memoirs; sermons, speeches,
                    and lectures; and miscellaneous.</p>
            <p>An explanation of the entries follows. The first section in each entry contains the name of the
                    person, family, or place under which the entry is catalogued; next is the entry title or heading,
                    the inclusive dates of the item or n.d. (no date), the number of items, and the number of pages in
                    the item. The second section describes the scope and content of the item and gives the county
                    discussed in the item. The third section indicates the name of the contributor or the location of
                    the original. In the fourth section, identifying numbers assigned by the project are given: the
                    manuscript project number, preceded by (X) for xerox or (M) for microfilm (or, for example, M-2, to
                    indicate the second entry on a microfilm reel). The final number, the MS number, indicates how
                    entries may be found in the index to the guide, which has been separately prepared and deposited
                    with each of the cooperating libraries. For a more complete description of the Sesquicentennial

                    timberlands, coal fields, and bluegrass regions of the state. Most of the nearly 1,100 miles of lost
                    trackage has been abandoned since the early thirties, but more than 250 miles was discarded before
                    World War I. Many readers of this entertaining volume will be surprised to learn that in an earlier

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

            <p>This book is not primarily intended for the professional historian interested in railroad history,
                    but rather for the wider fraternity of the railroad buff. The text is sometimes abbreviated, but the
                    volume is enriched with more than three hundred well selected photographs and illustrations. The
                    reader for whom this work was written will not worry about the absent documentation and will delight
                    in the numerous maps, timetables, charts, and track profiles which accompany each chapter. The
                    author, a long time professor of radio and television at Indiana University, has spent much of his
                    spare time in recent years in researching and studying the forgotten railroads of the Bluegrass

            <p>Douglas Schwartz has spent many years of his archaeological career working and promoting the
                    development of prehistoric research in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. His contributions both to program development and publication are extensive. He is
                    exceptionally qualified to write an intellectual history of archaeological research in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The book under review covers the development of archaeological work in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> from the earliest investigations to the present. The role of Colonel William S. Webb is
                    given detailed and extensive treatment. This emphasis is merited, as no other man exerted as much
                    influence on the study <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-064-3-076"/> of the prehistory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> as did Webb. He was not the first, but he was the most vigorous. According to Schwartz
                    his major contribution was his organizing genius that put archaeology "on the map"
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

            <p>There are those who will read this book with nostalgia and hope to find in it a list of individuals
                    and their contributions. The scope of the work is not directed toward this end, however. For
                    example, the late Charles Erasmus Snow is not dealt with, although his contributions to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> archaeology were many. But this is an intellectual history which deals with the main
                    trends of ideas. Snow and others are not discussed because their contributions to the field were
                    factual and ancilliary.</p>
            <p>The book is well written and sustains one's interest. In format, it is an acceptable job.
                    The illustrations are well done and contribute to the total impact and interest of the volume.</p>
            <p>This book will be useful at a variety of levels. For those who wish to have a few hours of enjoyable
                    reading to recall the bygone days of archaeology in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> the volume is eminently suitable. For others, who wish to delve into the history and
                    development of ideas and intellectual approaches to prehistory, the book will be stimulating and
                    provocative. Schwartz is to be commended for this fine piece of work which has such broad interest
                    and application.</p>

                    </placeName> Industrial University. By the time of inaugural festivities, nine days later, the grand
                    total had swelled to sixty-eight young men. Local farmers, state politicians, educators, and
                    students crowded into the new chapel to hear the opening day speeches. The last address was given by
                    the first regent of the university, John Milton Gregory, who, because of the preceding long-winded
                    speaker, scrapped his prepared text and gave a short extemporaneous talk. Gregory declared that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Industrial University (later renamed the University of <placeName>

                    </placeName>) would promote the industrial interests of the people of the state. The new regent did
                    not completely shed his liberal arts beliefs and emphasized that the new institution did not hope to
                    send forth men who were "puffed up by some little smattering of science, but clear-headed,
                    broad-breasted scholars, men of fully developed minds …" (p. 82). Though
                    receiving a large land grant through the Morrill Act of 1862, the recently opened university
                    continued to teach liberal arts courses. The vague wording of the landmark act had left the role of
                    liberal arts in limbo and led to widespread disagreement on what the land-grant schools should
                    teach. Until his resignation thirteen years later, Gregory directed the university on a course that
                    was sensitive to the needs <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-064-3-077"/> of agriculture and industry yet did
                    not ignore the ethical and aesthetic enrichment of the students.</p>

            <p>In providing the setting in which Gregory walked, the author too readily subscribes to
                    generalization. He writes that the decades between the War of 1812 and the Civil War "saw
                    the development of a singular American culture" (p. 1). He maintains that Americans
                    constructed a set of postulates that determined their modes of living. While one might question
                    whether this generalization could stand for any period of our past, it seems that the period in
                    question was the opposite of what Kersey maintains. His argument fails to explain the wide
                    differences of opinions on man and society that were dogmatically espoused. Progress held radically
                    different meanings to Americans, and the strife in the decades before the Civil War brought home the
                    deepness of that disunity.</p>
            <p>Kersey ends his career biography of Gregory with the words: "IF YOU SEEK HIS MONUMENT, LOOK
                    AROUND YOU." This advice is carved on a stone marker that stands on the campus of the
                    university and marks the final resting place of the prominent educator. Through the constant efforts
                    of many who followed, Gregory's monument-the University of <placeName>

            <p>The author appears to be more interested in the humanities than in wars and politics. Architecture
                    receives considerable emphasis, with representative buildings of the Federal, Greek Revival, and
                    Gothic styles much in evidence. (Many of these illustrations came from the Historic American
                    Buildings Survey and the National Archives.) May also seems to delight in presenting restorations

            <p>In this era of racial awareness the American Indian remains a neglected minority group. Roy W.
                    Meyer's <hi rend="i">History of the Santee Sioux</hi>, however, sheds significant light on
                    at least one portion of that race. His accurate and important study traces the course of the Santee
                    from first white contact to the present time. It is not a pleasant story. As he points out,
                    "The course they have followed in the past three centuries has, unfortunately, been mostly
                    downward" (p. 358).</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>-based Santee Sioux never attained the popular prominence of their plains brethren,
                    perhaps because they did not kill Custer; but <pb n="251" id="VAA4025-064-3-079"/> their 1862
                    uprising proved equally as electrifying to the United States and far more devastating. This exploit
                    proved the tribe's undoing and hastened the process of cultural decline. The whites harried
                    the tribe out of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, leaving only a handful of refugees in the state. The bulk of the Santee were placed on
                    reservations in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> and South Dakota.</p>
            <p>Although an analysis of a relatively narrow segment of the Indian population, the story has broad
                    application to the study of general Indian policy because, as Meyer notes, the "history of
                    the Santee Sioux is the history of the American Indian" (p. 371). The bitter fruits of the
                    Dawes Act and other similar well-intentioned but ill-conceived legislation for the Indians are
                    starkly portrayed. Also presented is the picture of a people who often loudly proclaimed their
                    readiness for self-government but when given the opportunity found themselves incapable of even
                    financial independence from the federal government.</p>
            <p>Although this volume is not easy reading and certain statements of a general nature could be
                    challenged, Meyer has thoroughly grounded his study by diligent research at the National Archives,
                    and the final product is a tribute to his efforts. More books like it are sorely needed because only
                    after they are written can valid analysis of the success or failure of American Indian policy be
                    made.</p>

                    enterprise, treating institutional development, entrepreneurship, politics, and finance. But if the

                    federal government, which converted the line to a sea level route in the late 1920's. Under
                    governmental control, the canal underwent enlargements (a major project is presently under way); and
                    it is now a vital segment of the Atlantic Coast navigational system.</p>
            <p>The Chesapeake and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> history is unusual, for it spans the long period from colonial times to the present.
                    Gray (a member of the Indiana University faculty) provides invaluable information on early efforts
                    in the 1760's to survey the route; on the promotional effort that successfully saw the
                    canal project to completion in 1829; and on the financing, administration, and traffic of the canal
                    since then. He also emphasizes differences between <pb n="252" id="VAA4025-064-3-080"/> canal
                    operation in the antebellum epoch of mercantile dominance and in the modern period.</p>
            <p>All the themes commonly found in studies of pre-1860 canal promotion and development are here: the
                    impact of urban and state rivalries on planning, the diverse roles played by promoters and
                    engineers, the struggle for federal aid, and the like. Much of the detail, however, bears on
                    significant general problems. For instance, Gray incorporates rich data on engineering,
                    construction, and navigational techniques. The Chesapeake and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> managers' attempts to apply steampower parallel the early American
                    railroadmen's efforts at "research and development" through design of
                    locomotives and experimentation with their use at company expense. Here too is a vivid microcosmic
                    account of swift technological change—including railway competition as early as the
                    1830's—and of strategies adopted by canal managers to meet the challenge. These
                    and other developments are well documented, by reference to the Chesapeake and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> manuscript records, state archival sources, congressional documents, and contemporary
                    pamphlets and legal briefs.</p>
            <p>In addition, Gray provides excellent discussions of the leading personalities in the enterprise,
                    among them Matthew Carey, John Randel, and Benjamin Latrobe. His chapter on the Civil War years,
                    when the canal assumed great importance in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName>'s strategy and logistics, is exceptionally lively in a book otherwise written
                    in a fairly dry style.</p>
            <p>Beginning in the 1870's, the private company's flexibility for responding to
                    manifold problems began to wither under financial pressures. Gray indicates well how the locus of
                    interest and initiative passed from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> and how the older pattern of locally oriented interest groups gave way to pressure from
                    well-organized shippers, industrialists, and merchants from all the Atlantic Coast cities.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren and Jackson, has got to the heart of the bank controversy, has methodically
                    explored a wide variety of primary materials, and has told his story with a flair that is bound to
                    keep his readers awake and wondering what will happen next.</p>
            <pb n="253" id="VAA4025-064-3-081"/>
            <p>Remini's thesis is that the main element in the bank war of the 1830's was Andrew <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> himself rather than forces emphasized by other authors— the western farmer,
                    the eastern working man, the rising entrepreneur, or a particular social group. Two stubborn,
                    powerful men faced each other: <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> and President Nicholas Biddle of the Bank of the United States. At many points in the
                    conflict, Remini believes, a compromise which would have preserved a badly needed central banking
                    system and still have introduced a necessary degree of governmental regulation was entirely
                    possible; but owing to pride or prejudice, neither stubborn man would consent to it.</p>
            <p>So the focus is on <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> the politician, instead of financial, constitutional, sociological, or ideological
                    aspects. It was <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> who finally turned public opinion against the bank by 1834, though the President had
                    run against the current earlier. Remini thinks that a majority of the people favored the bank at the
                    outset and even through the election of 1832 (when <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> probably lost rather than gained votes because of his recharter veto). This assessment
                    of opinion corresponds with the findings of Jean Wilburn in another recent book on the subject but
                    rests upon soft, incomplete evidence. In any case, the dynamic ingredient was <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName>'s conviction that this monopolistic corporation wielded too much power over
                    the nation's economy and government. And <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName>'s victory was a tribute to his considerable skills as a politician and to his
                    capacity of democratic leadership.</p>
            <p>The long-run consequences were important. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> materially built up the office of the presidency to a position of much greater strength
                    than it had ever had previously. The President developed the veto as a valuable instrument in policy
                    making, he actively participated in the legislative process, he prevailed in his insistence upon
                    complete control over his cabinet, he stimulated the resurgence of the two-party system, and he
                    became the only national official representing the American people as a whole.</p>
            <p>In terms of what the author proposes to do, perhaps beyond that as well, the book is both informative
                    and interesting. No doubt it will be received quite favorably indeed.</p>

            <p>The noted Reformation scholar, Lewis W. Spitz, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, ventures into the field of nineteenth century American frontier history
                    with this biography and career evaluation of an Indiana Lutheran pioneer, William Sihler. The
                    founder of several Lutheran colleges, Sihler exerted a profound influence in the organization of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Synod from his position as pastor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Lutheran Church, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1845–1885.</p>
            <p>The book's title is well chosen. Sihler lived exactly half of his eighty-four years in
                    Germany, half of them in America. Spitz, however, gives the title another twist. He explains,
                    quoting Leigh Hunt: "There are two worlds—the <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-064-3-082"/> world we measure with line and rule, and the world we feel with our hearts and with our
                    imaginations. Sihler lived intently in the real world about him and in the world of the spirit
                    within him" (p. 172).</p>
            <p>The ten chapters of the book are like separate essays which tie into each other very nicely to
                    present a clear character portrayal. While the essays are of special interest to Lutherans, they
                    contain valuable historical material for any student of frontier American church history. Though
                    Spitz himself is a Lutheran, he is very frank in his criticisms of Sihler's "old
                    world hangups." For example, he terms Sihler "a transplanted European living in a
                    linguistically, culturally, and religiously isolated community, as impervious to frontier influences
                    as he could make himself" (p. 10).</p>
            <p>With respect to Sihler's impact on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Synod, Spitz indicates, on the basis of considerable exarnination of the early issues
                    of <hi rend="i">Der Lutheraner</hi>, that "there is an intimation that two years before the
                    organization of the Synod (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1847) Sihler had evolved a concept of a synod represented by a senate of permanent
                    delegates rather than the Jacksonian-type triennial meetings ad hoc such as C. F. W. Walther
                    favored" (p. 81). Sihler became, in turn, the synod's first vicc. president,
                    overswing the eastern part of thesynod, and the first president of the Central District (1854).
                    Sihler also left a distinctive mark on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Synod through his numerous writings.</p>
            <p>E. S. <hi rend="i">Gaustad's Historical Atlas of Religions in America</hi> indicates that
                    most <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Indiana counties</region>
                    </placeName> are predominantly (United) Methodist. I t is noteworthy, therefore, that Spitz faults
                    both Sihler and the pioneer Lutheran missionary, F. C. D. Wyneken, with a lack of appreciation of
                    Methodism's appeal to frontier communities and its still very evangelical emphasis. Spitz
                    translates a portion of the lengthy tract Sihler published in 1844 against the Methodists. Though
                    Sihler reacted strongly against the personalism of Methodist theology, he did approve of a Methodist
                    emphasis against the use of alcohol, a view quite contrary to that "of his hard-drinking
                    Germans" (p. 170).</p>
            <p>At one point Spitz repeats an error somewhat current in <placeName>

                    Lutheran churches in central and southern Indiana [e.g. St. John's Sunman (ACL), Ebenezer
                    and First United, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName>'s, founded in 1837.</p>
            <p>Written in a unique Spitz style with side excursions into many philosophical and theological thought
                    patterns which influenced Sihler, Life in Two Worlds is actually a look into numerous worlds. Spitz
                    draws comparisons of Sihler's views to nineteenth century rationalistic premises he first
                    embraced, to Luther's stance on doctrinal and social issues, and to contemporary Lutheran
                    positions. This grcatly increases the book's worth. The biographical notes and the index
                    make the volume even more useful and informative.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Beloved Lady: A History of Jane Addams' Ideas on Reform and Peace</hi>. By
                    John C. Farrell. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>

            <p>Clearly written with devotion reflecting the author's personal convictions, this book is at
                    the same time objective reporting of sound scholarship. It is not a biography of Jane Addams in the
                    usual sense. It is rather an analysis of her intellectual development. The personal circumstances of
                    her life appear only to the extent that they help the reader to understand the growth of her basic
                    ideas. In this task Farrell does a superb job. Tracing her Rockford College years, followed by
                    restless travel and search for identity, and the early years at Hull House where directions of
                    intellectual development begin to take shape, the author convincingly portrays the steps toward the
                    eventual evolution of mature convictions and passionately held commitments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Beloved Lady</hi> is surprisingly timely for the 1960's. This is in part
                    because of Miss Addams' devotion throughout her more than forty years of active public life
                    to two concerns which have high social and political priority today: the building of a truly
                    effective democracy and the immorality of war and its futility as an effective means toward
                    acceptable international relations and understanding. It is timely also because of current renewed
                    interest in the Progressive Movement, in which Miss Addams was one of the moving forces.</p>
            <p>The book will support the opinion, expressed by some, that in the long run Miss Addams'
                    greatest contribution may well prove to be intellectual rather than through her activities as a
                    leader in the Settlement House Movement in this country.</p>
            <p>An important conclusion of the author is that, as Miss Addams grew older and more secure in her
                    beliefs, she came more and more strongly to think that it was not enough to speak and write, but
                    that the individual must <hi rend="i">act</hi> on the basis of his convictions. This she did with
                    vigor and passion. Even during World War I years, when she was widely and bitterly criticized for
                    her views, she found ways to make active social contributions within the limitations of her own
                    abhorrence of war.</p>
            <p>Farrell's bibliography is extensive, covering both published and unpublished sources. There
                    is clear evidence that he examined an enormous number and wide variety of materials and evaluated
                    them in a scholarly and objective manner. It is not just a survey of available resources but a
                    synthesized concept and understanding of Jane Addams' mind and thinking. The bibliography
                    will be useful to future scholars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Beloved Lady</hi> will be of importance to any social historian interested in the period
                    it covers or in the development of the Progressive Movement in the world as well as in this country,
                    for in the later decades of her life Jane Addams was a significant international as well as national
                    leader. It is also a most readable book which will be of interest to the general reader concerned
                    with his society and its improvement, especially with human relationships (and all their
                    implications for urban development, minority groups, etc.) and with international relationships and
                    world peace.</p>

            <p>It is all but impossible to study the early life of a prominent political figure without attempting
                    to descern the development of those character traits and ideological convictions associated with him
                    in his public years. In the case of Woodrow Wilson, as Osborn correctly observes in his preface,
                    this tendency has been carried to an outrageous extreme by the recently published Freud-Bullitt
                    exercise in secondhand psychoanalysis. Consequently, Osborn has written of Wilson's early
                    years with the avowed purpose of refraining from drawing any inferences for the future and of
                    allowing Wilson's personality to emerge solely from a presentation of the facts. That he
                    does not entirely succeed in his design is somewhat disconcerting to the reader but does not by any
                    means obviate the value of the work.</p>
            <p>Despite the author's attempt to write history wie es eigentlich gcwesen, certain threads of
                    interpretation inevitably develop. One can hardly read Osborn's discussions of
                    Wilson's tendencies to rationalize defeats and to despise rivals without applying these
                    traits to the League of Nations struggle. Nor can the reader follow the author's
                    development of such themes in Wilson's scholarly writings as the need for a strong
                    executive and the dangers of congressional supremacy without thinking of his later tendency to
                    regard himself as the tribune of the people and the legislative branch as the habitat of men with
                    "bungalow minds." Wilson's penchant for drafting the charters of debating
                    societies and mock parliaments, to which Osborn makes frequent reference, naturally conjures up
                    images of his role in formulating the covenant of the League of Nations, while the denunciations of
                    strident nationalism articu; lated in his writings seem to prefigure the internationalist stance of
                    his administration. The reader will also discern the development of such other Wilsonian traits as a
                    Calvinist sense of morality, a distaste for lawyers and legalism, and a fierce, stubborn pride. The
                    difficulty with all of this is that one is never entirely certain if these are conclusions which he
                    himself has drawn from the facts presented, or whether they are really Osborn's judgments
                    which the reader has been persuaded to accept by the author's method of selecting and
                    presenting information. Since Osborn has seemingly amassed sufficient evidence to justify stating
                    the conclusions which the reader will almost inevitably draw, it would have been more forthright to
                    have asserted them explicitly.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Osborn's <hi rend="i">Wilson</hi> is a remarkable feat of scholarship, based
                    upon a seemingly exhaustive study of the available manuscript material and free from the obvious
                    partisanship which has infected most other studies of Wilson's early life. Of particular
                    importance to scholars are the detailed discussions of Wilson's numerous writings and
                    speeches on educational philosophy, political science, and American history, each of which receives
                    at least a full chapter. Nor does Osborn fail to consider his subject's personal life,
                    describing not only his relationships with his family and close friends but also his en <pb n="257" id="VAA4025-064-3-085"/> counters with some of the leading scholars of the day, such as

               <hi rend="i">Constitutional Politics in the Progressive Era: Child Labor and the Law</hi>. By
                    Stephen B. Wood. (<placeName>

                    </placeName> Press, 1968. Pp. xiv, 320. Notes, bibliographic notes, index. $10.00.)</head>
            <p>Wood bills this work, focusing upon the campaign for a federal child labor law, as a case study of
                    "the deeply political processes by which constitutional law is formed." He further
                    writes, "an understanding of constitutional development involves more than insight
                    … into the operation of federal judicial power. It necessitates exploration of every
                    phase of democratic policy formation—from the coalescence of politically relevant opinion
                    and the enactment of public policies by the popular branches of government through judicial
                    construction of the limits of the powers and the legitimacy of the purposes embodied in legislation
                    …" (pp. ix-x).</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, his study fails to fulfill this promise. He docs not adequately explore the forces
                    making for congressional passage first of the Keating- <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName> bill and then of the Pomerene amendment. His explanation boils down to little more than
                    an appeal to the spirit of the times. He does not, for example, discuss the role of the
                    nation's women's clubs in agitating the question; he does not explain the shift by
                    the AFL from opposition to support of federal legislation; he does not show in sufficient detail the
                    activities of the National Child Labor Committee in promoting favorable sentiment and lobbying in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>. Moreover, the author stops in the middle of the story. He does not even try to explain
                    the failure to ratify the child labor amendment. And the reversal of <hi rend="i">Hammer v.
                        Dagenhart</hi> (1918) in the <hi rend="i">Darby Lumber Company</hi> case (1941) is summarily
                    dealt with in two pages with the explanation that the depression brought about "a
                    transformation of popular sentiment" (p. 300).</p>
            <p>The heart of the book—and its chief contribution—is its summary of the
                    constitutional arguments, pro and con, in the debate on child labor in Congress, its detailed
                    account of the steps taken in the litigation testing the constitutionality of the Keating-<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName> bill and the Pomerene amendment, and its analysis of the resulting Supreme Court
                    decisions.</p>
            <p>Yet even within these limits the work suffers from weaknesses. Although Wood's assessment of
                    the motives impelling the justices is on the whole judicious, it could have been strengthened by
                    more research into their private papers. Except for a few scattered references to the Taft Papers,
                    he has not <pb n="258" id="VAA4025-064-3-086"/> done this. In addition, the author is highly
                    partisan in favor of the supporters of federal child labor legislation. This is reflected in such
                    invidious phraseology as the reference to the "textile oligarchy" (p. 65) and his
                    complaint about the justices reading their "anachronistic" convictions into the
                    Constitution (p. 156).</p>
            <p>More importantly, Wood's partisanship leads him into substantive difficulties. Thus, for
                    example, he exaggerates the inconsistency of the <hi rend="i">Dagenhart</hi> decision with existing
                    precedents. The fact was that Supreme Court had developed two distinct lines of
                    precedent—one upholding national power, the second hewing to the limiting doctrine of
                    dual federalism—which gave the justices broad leeway in picking and choosing in any given
                    case. Nor was the decision as irreconcilable with <hi rend="i">Hoke v. United States</hi> (1913) as
                    Wood suggests. The Mann Act prohibited the transportation of women across state lines for immoral
                    purposes; it did not deal with prostitution within the states.</p>
            <p>Second, the argument of the defenders of the two measures that the Supreme Court should not look
                    beyond the face of the law to the motives of Congress is—as has been indicated in
                    subsequent constitutional history— a double-edged sword. And this preachment was not
                    consistently followed even by those who urged it in this case. Was not the aim of the Brandeis brief
                    in the <hi rend="i">Muller</hi> case (1908) to educate the justices to the purposes of the
                    legislation?</p>
            <p>Third, the fears of conservatives about the consequences of upholding the measures were not as
                    "entirely visionary" as Wood assumes. Admittedly, Congress "has yet to
                    outlaw red-headed passengers from interstate transit" (p. 302). But the <hi rend="i">Darby</hi> decision did symbolize and confirm a fundamental change, for good or ill depending upon
                    one's point of view, in the previously existing federal equilibrium. It is noteworthy that
                    many sincere proponents of curbing child labor did find merit in the Drexel decision (1922) and that
                    its limitations upon the federal taxing power remain accepted law to this day.</p>
            <p>There are a number of minor typographical errors—Lippett for Lippitt (pp.
                    76-77)—and factual errors—Atlee Pomerene was hardly a
                    protégé of Tom <placeName>

                    </placeName> (p. 193).</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these demurrers, Wood's study is a significant contribution to the
                    understanding of twentieth century American constitutional development—especially the
                    shortcomings of a system that relies upon private litigation to test great public policies.</p>

               <hi rend="i">From Sacred to Profane America: The Role of Religion in American History</hi>. By
                    William A. Clebsch. (New York: Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1968. Pp. xi, 242. "Notes,
                    index. $5.95.)</head>
            <p>Professor William Clebsch even in the title of his volume makes quite clear the premises under which
                    he writes. If he does not explicitly belong to <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-064-3-087"/> the
                    "God is dead" school, he professes to believe that religion has ceased to have
                    influence in American life. He defines what is sacred as "that which is religious in
                    nature, use or association" and what is profane as "that which has discarded,
                    superseded or otherwise lost its religious nature, use or association" (p. ix). The history
                    of how religion inspired so much and yet achieved its own exclusion is the theme of the volume.
                    "In that sense the unintended but nevertheless salutary effect of religion on American
                    history has been to make a nation profaned-a society standing <hi rend="i">pro-fanum</hi>, outside
                    of religion's temple" (pp. 1-2). The major defect of his argument is that he never
                    defines exactly what religion is.</p>
            <p>The six contributions of religion as defined by Clebsch can hardly be attributed to any of the better
                    known "religious institutions" in the nation's history. Yet the variety
                    of religious institutions in the United States during the past two centuries might cause the
                    historian to wonder how these six were chosen. One cannot but wonder where Clebsch found his
                    "six campaigns," none of which seem to include a revealed doctrine or a purpose
                    beyond this life.</p>
            <p>The author has applied his thesis to nearly every prominent name in American religious history, so
                    much so that a refutation of his dogmas about them would require a considerable library. The
                    historian can only gasp at some of his generalizations. "On close examination, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s convenant theology reveals a profound hope for novelty that is full of
                    complexity, not simplicity. The profane version of that convenant hardly detached the American
                    experience from its past, near or remote" (p. 42). Or again: "The trend of
                    American history from religious inspiration toward profane achievement elicited an ironic religious
                    opposition to the very innovations which in large measure were religiously inspired. If <placeName>

                    </placeName> secularized the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> religious convenant, in doing so he stirred enough <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New England</region>
                    </placeName> antagonism to threaten the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName> and a return to an American past of which Yankees were keenly conscious. Moreover,
                    religion's feeding of novelties into the American diet was often interrupted by the
                    traditioning force of religion which, although less prominent in America than its innovating force,
                    demands careful attention" (p. 43). That the religion Clebsch accepts for the present
                    period is profane depends upon his definitions and his characterization of the persons he quotes.
                    His generalizations about Roman Catholicism are snap judgments based upon very slight information. A
                    complicated study is needed to explain the decline in religious fervor in American religious
                    institutions generally and the increase in membership in religious organizations. But such a study
                    wou d be a slow process and would suppose a clear concept of what religion is.</p>

            <p>Carl Condit's most recent publication is an outgrowth of his previous writings: <hi rend="i">The Rise of the Skyscraper</hi> (1952), <hi rend="i">American Building Art—The
                        Nineteenth Century</hi> (1960), <hi rend="i">American Building Art—The Twentieth

                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName> School of Architecture</hi> (1964). The publication is one in a series of topical
                    volumes in <hi rend="i">The <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName> History of American Civilization</hi>, edited by Daniel J. Boorstin. The purpose of
                    the work is to trace the development of the American building arts from the most primitive temporary
                    structures of the seventeenth century to the most complex and sophisticated buildings of the
                    twentieth century. Thus great emphasis is placed upon the materials: timber, iron, steel, and
                    concrete and their evolutionary construction techniques. The book is intended as a "popular
                    history of American building." The title is misleading if not a misnomer. A more accurate
                    title would be <hi rend="i">American Construction</hi> since about 40 per cent of the text and 53 of
                    the 112 illustrations are of dams and bridges of a variety of types. The illustrations are taken
                    from two of Condit's earlier publications; their quality is excellent. However, they are
                    totally inadequate in quantity to illustrate visually Condit's verbal analysis of truss
                    types, particularly his detailed discussion for compression and tension forces and their
                    juxtaposition in a truss or force diagram.</p>
            <p>A visual glossary would have been almost necessary for even a professional student of architecture or
                    structural engineering to understand how various chords, ribs, webs, piers, and reactions can be
                    analyzed. Thus the layman will experience considerable difficulty in reading the text. A greater
                    number of simple line drawings similar to Figure 3 and integrated in the text would have solved this
                    problem. Footnotes are almost nonexistent (only one), and the source material is listed under
                    general headings. Thus the author's scholarship is most difficult to document. The book is
                    attractive and well edited and will provide a solid basis for the general reader who has a deep
                    interest in American construction and its historical sources.</p>

                    This volume offers information concerning and evidence of military service for approximately
                    fourteen hundred veterans of the American Revolution who are buried in Indiana. It is interesting
                    but not surprising to note that a large majority of those listed are buried in counties of the
                    southern half of the state. As Mrs. O'Byrne indicates in the Foreword, this <hi rend="i">Roster of Soldiers and Patriots of the American Revolution Buried in Indiana</hi> is the work
                    of many persons over a period of years. She recognizes that the roster may be incomplete and subject
                    to correction, and she invites information about possible omissions as well as additional data
                    regarding persons listed.</p>
