            <p>[A paper written about 1855 by the Rev. L. D. Potter, an early Presbyterian minister in the
                        <geogName>Whitewater Valley</geogName>, and for a long- time President of Glendale Female
                    College, Glendale, O. This account is an excellent supplement for the ground it covers to H. A.
                    Edson's Early Indiana Pres-byterianísm, and valuable in the study of Indiana
                    church history, a rather neglected field in most histories of the State. For the manuscript we are
                    indebted to Mr. Harry M. Stoops, of <placeName>

            <p>IT is proposed in this brief record to preserve some reminiscences of the efforts, successful and
                    unsuccessful, to plant a Presbyterian Church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and to rescue from oblivion before it is too late, some facts which may be of
                    interest, not only to us but to those who come after us. It is hoped that additions may hereafter be
                    made to these scattered fragments of history and that our efforts in this respect may stimulate
                    others to carry forward the work thus commenced.</p>
            <p>The town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> being laid out in that narrow strip of country known as "the first
                    purchase," began to have a "local habitation and a name" in the earliest
                    records of the territory lying west of the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The first settlement in this vicinity was made about the year 1800, after which time
                    the tide of emigration seems to have increased for several years. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> having been early selected by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Government as a paying station for the American Indians, increased rapidly in
                    population from 1810 to 1816, when the territory became a State, at which time it is supposed the
                    number of inhabitants was nearly as great as it is now.</p>
            <p>After the second purchase of land was made, and especially after the complete division of the country
                    into counties, a large number from the town and vicinity moved away into the newer portions of the
                    State. Among these were several who afterward rose to distinction as professional men and
                    politicians.</p>
            <p>After this the population decreased, owing to the fact above stated and to the extensive prevalence
                    of sickness, until about the year 1833, at which time,' and for some years previous, more
                        <pb n="29" id="VAA4025-005-1-035"/> than one-half of the houses in the town were tenantless and
                    dilapidated. From that time to the present the population has increased more or less from year to
                    year.</p>
            <p>Like most other portions of the western country, this region was settled by persons from various
                    sections of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and of various religious views. The majority, however, appear to have been from the
                    Southern States, and the prevailing religious denomination was the Baptist.</p>
            <p>The first Presbyterian minister of whose labors we have any authentic record in this region was the
                    Rev. Samuel Baldridge, a native of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, who first removed to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and afterward to this State, and who is still living at an advanced age. He organized a
                    church of seventeen members in 1811 at the house of John Allen, near Harrison, and preached to that
                    church statedly until 1814. From 1810 to 1814 he labored as an itinerant missionary in the
                        <geogName>Whitewater valley</geogName>, having various preaching stations from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Dunlapsville. He preached here and at Robert Templeton's, but more
                    frequently at John Temple-ton's and Mr. Hanna's, near Hanna's creek. At
                    that time there were several families here who were either members or adherents of the Presbyterian
                    church. Among these were Mr. and Mrs.–Barbour, from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>; Judge Arthur Dixon and wife and brother, from Harper's Church,
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Washington county</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>; Mr.–Young, who kept what has since been known as
                    the "old yellow tavern," and who was from Pennsylvania; Mr. John Vincent and wife;
                    Mr. Robert Templeton and wife; the parents of Mrs. Ryburn; the Knights, and Mr. and Mrs. William
                    McCleery, who were from Frederick, Md.</p>
            <p>All of these resided in the town except Mr. Templeton, the parents of Mrs. Ryburn, and one of the
                    Dixons. The latter lived on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName> road at the foot of "Boundary Hill." He afterward moved to a farm
                    near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a few years later united with a Methodist Episcopal Church. Arthur Dixon was a
                    blacksmith. He removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1823, and his wife was one of the early members of the church organized there.</p>
            <p>After the removal of Mr. Baldridge from <placeName>

                    </placeName> there was occasional preaching in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and others, but no regular supply at either place for four or five years. During that
                    time, however, several Presbyterian families, mostly from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> and Pennsylvania, moved to <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and from 1816 to 1825 efforts were made to gather the scattered members into churches,
                    which resulted in the formation within a few years of four churches, viz.: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1818, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 18–, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Somerset</settlement>
                    </placeName> about 1823, and Bath in 1825.</p>
            <p>During this period, besides occasional supplies from Presbytery and various intinerant clergymen, the
                    friends of Presbyterianism were much encouraged by the faithful and zealous labors of two young
                    ministers who came from the East as domestic missionaries. These were Adams W. Piatt, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, and William B. Barton, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>. After spending three or four years traversing the country from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, these brethren, to the great grief of the people, saw fit to return to their native
                    States. Mr. Piatt afterward preached in several different places in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, and Mr. Barton settled as pastor at <placeName>

               </placeName>, where he
                    remained until his death in 1850.</p>
            <p>The way being prepared for the organization of a church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Judge Loughlin, at the request of several citizens, members and others, met the
                    Presbytery of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the spring of 1818 and requested them to visit the place for that purpose. The
                    Presbytery accordingly appointed Rev. Joshua L. Wilson, D. D., of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to perform that service, and a church was organized by him in the court-house, then
                    nearly finished, in May of the same year. The able and eloquent discourses preached by this eminent
                    servant of God are still remembered with lively interest by some who heard them and who still
                    survive in this vicinity. About the same time a small Methodist class was formed, of which Samuel
                    Goodwin was the leader, and previous to this two flourishing Baptist churches were in existence, one
                    three miles south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which still exists, and one three miles west, near the residence of Fielding Jeter,
                    deceased, which was disbanded many years ago.</p>
            <p>The church above referred to was organized under very favorable auspices and at first was in a
                    promising condition, but for reasons which we will hereafter give, it went down about the <pb n="31" id="VAA4025-005-1-037"/> year 1821 or 1822. There was at the time no regularly organized church
                    in the town and no house of worship. It is to be regretted that sessional records are lost, and
                    after the most diligent search no trace of them can be found. It is supposed, however, that they
                    were in the possession of Judge Loughlin, whose papers were burned with the house of Job Pugh, Esq.,
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, administrator of his estate. We present such facts in reference to the history as we
                    have been able to glean from various sources.</p>
            <p>The number of members at first is supposed to have been about twenty, whose names as far as can be
                    ascertained are as follows: William B. Loughlin and his wife; James Goudie and Mary, his wife; Neri
                    Ogdeh and Mary, his wife; Obadiah Bennett and Ruth, his wife; William Rose and wife; Andrew Reed and
                    Rebecca, his wife; Joseph Goudie; John Cummins and Martha, his wife, and two daughters, Lucinda and
                    Mary; Mrs. Oliver, wife of Br. Oliver; John Huston and Sarah, his wife; George Wallace and Eveline,
                    his wife; Thomas Selfridge and Mary, his wife; John Vincent and wife; the parents of Mrs. Ryburn
                    (names not known); Mrs. Henderson, wife of John Henderson; Robert Templeton and wife; Mrs. Westcott;
                    Mrs. Murdock; Mrs. Drew; and Jane and Eliza Armstrong. Some of these probably joined after the
                    organization.</p>
            <p>The following adherents and attendants were trained in the faith of the Presbyterian church and were
                    probably baptized members, but not communicants: James Wallace and Sarah, his wife, now living at
                    the village of Union; John Huston and Sarah, his wife, now living in the bounds of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName> congregation and members of that church; – Huston (father of the last
                    mentioned) now a member of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> church; Mr. Meeks and wife (the latter still living here); Arthur Dixon and wife;
                    George Hammond, Mr. Westcott, Mr. McGinnis, Mr. Adair and wife (the latter still living in <placeName>

            <p>The places from which they came, as far as can be ascertained, were as follows: Andrew Reed and Mrs.

                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>. Several of these, however, had resided in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> or the vicinity a short time previous to their coming here and were known to Dr.
                    Wilson.</p>
            <p>The session consisted of five ruling elders, viz., William Rose, William B. Loughlin, James Goudie,
                    Obadiah Bennett and Neri Ogden.</p>
            <p>Soon after the organization of the church a flourishing Sabbath school was commenced, in which nearly
                    all of the members of the church engaged as teachers. It is believed to have been one the first
                    Sabbath schools, if not the first, established in the State, and was continued until most of the
                    members had removed from town. One or two of the Methodist brethren assisted occasionally in the
                    school. After this was discontinued, no other was attempted for several years. The members of the M.
                    E. Church started one occasionally, which was at times in a good condition and at times abandoned
                    altogether. After the reorganization of the Presbyterian Church, and about the commencement of the
                    labors of Rev. William J. Patterson, the two churches formed 3 union Sunday-school, which was,
                    however, soon divided, and the two have been in successful operation from that time to the present.</p>
            <p>About the year 1820 an effort was made to erect a house of worship. A lot was selected adjoining the
                    old graveyard and near the place where the Catholic Church now stands, a subscription raised to pay
                    for it, and the timbers brought on the ground, but before anything further was done, nearly all the
                    members had left town and the people began to be discouraged. Not a single trustee was a member of
                    the church, the people were dissatisfied <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-005-1-039"/> with the minister, Rev.
                    G. G. Brown, who had been preaching since before the organization of the church, and the town was
                    decreasing rapidly in population. Under all these unfavorable circumstances the project was finally
                    abandoned, and the frame, after lying a long time on the ground, was sold. It is now
                    supposed" to form a part of Mrs. Meek's stable, and the lot has long since fallen
                    into other hands.</p>
            <p>The failure in building the house was an exceedingly unfortunate blow to the interests of
                    Presbyterianism in this place, inasmuch as the erection of a house would in all probability have
                    given perpetuity to the church, notwithstanding the adverse influences which were at that time in
                    operation against the town and church. About this time the church was dissolved and soon after
                    stricken from the roll of Presbytery. Three causes may be assigned for this deplorable result in a
                    church which was at first one of the most promising in the State:</p>
            <p>First, the removal of the members. All of them except Mrs. Oliver and one or two other females left
                    the place, most of whom went so far away as to be entirely out of the bounds of the congregation.</p>
            <p>Second, the character of the minister, Rev. Guernsey G. Brown. He was not a genuine Presbyterian,
                    either in feeling or sentiment. He was born in <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName>, educated in the Congregational Church and licensed by an association in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> for two years, according to a custom which then prevailed in that church. Under the
                    operation of the "Plan of Union" adopted by the General Assembly in 1801 and
                    abrogated in 1837, he was received as a licentiate by the Presbytery of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the fall of 1817 and allowed to labor in their bounds. Unfavorable reports soon
                    reached the Presbytery respecting his orthodoxy and ministerial character, but not sufficiently
                    tangible to furnish grounds for specific charges against him. At the expiration of the two years, he
                    applied to the Presbytery for a continuance of his license to preach. Influenced by his importunity,
                    his humble acknowledgments and his faithful promises to correct some inconsistencies in his
                    ministerial deportment, they reluctantly consented to continue his license for another year, but at
                    the expiration of that <pb n="34" id="VAA4025-005-1-040"/> time recalled it and refused to allow him
                    to preach longer. He was a man of inferior talents, trifling in his deportment, unsound according to
                    the Presbyterian standards in his religious creeds, and was considered by some as even of doubtful
                    piety. He consequently lost the confidence of the church and of the reflecting portion of the
                    citizens. He bought (in April, 1818), a lot of Allen in the town plot called after his name, and
                    built the house for many years occupied as a residence by William Beeks. It was sold under execution
                    by Noah Noble, sheriff, in November, 1823. He was for a time assistant editor of a paper then
                    published in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He afterward removed to Berksville, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Cumberland
                        county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, where by some
                    means he succeeded in gaining admittance to the Baptist Church.</p>
            <p>Third, the efforts made to organize other churches east, west and north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From fragments of this divided congregation were formed in part three other churches,
                    viz., <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Bath and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Somerset</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Goudies, Reed, Sering, Self-ridge, Cummins, James Wallace, and perhaps some others
                    went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Several Presbyterian families had come into the region east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, so much scattered that it was difficult to fix upon a suitable location, and they held
                    their services for a long time in private houses, barns, and in the woods. No less than seven sites
                    were selected, six of which were afterward abandoned. They were the following: (1) Near the Big
                    Cedar Baptist Church. Here they built a small log church which stood for several years after it was
                    abandoned as a place for Presbyterian preaching. (2) Near Nimrod Breckney's, on the hill
                    east of Big Cedar creek. (3) On the land of the late Peter Mills-paugh. (4) On the land of James
                    Goudie, Sr. (6) On the farm of James Thompson, east of Mr. Breckney's. (7) On the spot
                    where it now stands, which was at that time in the woods. The church was organized some time before
                    the house of worship was erected.</p>
            <p>Another church was organized about the year 1823 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Somerset</settlement>
                    </placeName>, now the suburbs of the town of Laurel. They never had a house of worship, but held
                    their services in different places, most frequently at the house of David Watson. The number of

                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. no energetic effort was made to organize another until the spring of 1839. During the
                    interval, however, there was Presbyterian preaching occasionally, as will be mentioned hereafter,
                    and several of the prominent citizens exerted themselves at times to secure the regular
                    ministrations of some one of our branch of the church. The state of religion was very low, and
                    universalism and infidelity prevailed to a considerable extent. Intemperance, profanity and Sabbath
                    breaking were for many years alarmingly prevalent.</p>
            <p>The Methodist Episcopal Church, which commenced its existence in April, 1816, with a class formed by
                    the late Samuel Goodwin, accomplished much for the spiritual interests of the community, but its
                    number of members was small for many years. It began to increase rapidly, however, soon after the
                    organization of this church in 1839, and has ever since, as is well known, been in a flourishing
                    condition.</p>
            <p>For many years a few of the citizens of the' town attended more or less regularly the
                    services of the Little Cedar Baptist Church, below <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was in a prosperous condition and enjoyed the faithful and efficient
                    ministrations of Rev. Mr. Tyner and Rev. Mr. Dewees. During the interval above referred to, a few
                    other Presbyterian families moved into the town or neighborhood, but subsequently united with other
                    churches, or remained still in connection with the churches from which they came. Among these were
                    Mrs. Clarkson, who retained her connection with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                    </placeName> until 1840; Mrs. Wise and Miss Ogden, now of Harrison; Mr. John C. Conrad, who moved

                    same may be said of Mr. John Warne and his mother, who came from the same region of the country.
                    Mrs. Hendrickson afterward joined the Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>

                    with great acceptance, in some instances by request on special subjects. At one time he was waited
                    on by Mr. R. John, Mr. Noble and other prominent citizens, who promised him, in behalf of the

                    society and was regarded a most estimable young man. He was importuned to remain and make an effort
                    to raise a Presbyterian Church, but preferred to return to <placeName>

            <p>Rev. David M. Stewart came here as a teacher in 1834 and pursued his theological studies at the same
                    time. He was licensed in October, 1835, and preached nearly every other Sabbath until April, 1836,

                    </placeName>, where he now resides. He was licensed in the middle of his school year and requested
                    the trustees to release him that he might devote himself to the preaching of the Gospel. The board
                    consisted of J. A. Matson, R. John, William McCleery, and others. They refused to release him on the
                    plea that they needed his services as a preacher as well as a teacher. He also preached at the mouth
                    of Duck creek (now Metamora) in Mr. Watson's house, where there were still two or three

            <p>William B. Loughlin was from Pennsylvania. He settled on what has since been called the Flint farm,
                    on the high ground between Pipe creek and the mouth of Snail creek, March 1, 1816. He taught school

                    Church. His descendants still remain there. Though fifteen miles distant, he was one of the most
                    regular attendants at the services on the Sabbath, coming down usually on Saturday and remaining
                    until Monday. Weather which usually detains others from going less than half a mile to the sanctuary
                    did not prevent him from traveling fifteen.</p>

            <p>John Cummins built a saw-mill at the south point of <geogName>Boundary Hill</geogName> and resided

                    maintained a consistent Christian character and a family altar until his death. His reason for not
                    uniting with the Bath Church, to which he was sufficiently convenient, is not known. His sons,

               </placeName>, and removed to the West Fork in 1800. They were both
                    members of the old church, but after it went down joined the Baptists. Their daughters, Mrs. Robert

                    in that State. Two of their sons, William and Amos, were members of this church at the time of their
                    decease, the latter a ruling elder. Mrs. William Stoops, also a member, still lives in our midst.</p>
            <p>David Watson was born in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in May, 1763, and came to America in 1801. He was a ruling elder in the church in

                        York</region>

                    creek (now Metamora) in 1816, where he remained until his death, which occurred July 25, 1850, at
                    the age of eighty-seven years. As before stated, he connected with <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was a plain but a very intelligent man and ardently attached to the Presbyterian
                    Church, though charitable to those who differed from him in doctrine and religious sentiment. During
                    all his life, and especially the latter part of it, he was a remarkable reader of the Scriptures.
                    The last time that he was privileged to engage in family worship (a few days previous to his death)
                    he read with much feeling parts <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-005-1-045"/> of the fifteenth and sixteenth
                    chapters of I Corinthians, and what was still more worthy of notice, narrated the substance of a
                    remarkable dream in which the Savior appeared to grant him special tokens of his kindness in
                    consequence of his early consecration to His service, promising to take him immediately to Himself.
                    This was before there were any indications of special sickness or of his being near his end. After
                    this beatific vision he set his house in order, waited anxiously for the hour of his departure and
                    fell asleep in Jesus after a very brief confinement to his bed. His house was a stopping place and a
                    home for Presbyterian ministers and a preaching station for ministers of all evangelical
                    denominations for thirty-five years. His three daughters still live in Metamora.</p>

                    removed to the mouth of the Little Miami in 1789, and was one of the eight who united in forming the

                    ruling elder in that church. In the great revival of 1801-'05 he first joined the New

                    spiritual interests of themselves or of the community, but rather by a spirit of opposition to some
                    measures connected with the erection of the Methodist Episcopal Church, at which certain persons not
                    connected with any church had taken umbrage. It is hoped, however, in the spirit of charity that
                    there were other reasons of a purer kind which were not apparent upon the surface, as some of these
                    persons were known to have had previous partialities for the Presbyterian Church. There were five
                    persons residing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> who had been members of the Presbyterian Church elsewhere, who expressed a wish to have
                    a church of their choice here, but took no part in those first efforts which were connected with the
                    opposition to the other church. At the suggestion of John A. Matson, Richard Tyner and others,
                    Jeremiah Woods addressed a letter to Dr. John W. Scott, then professor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, requesting him to come over and preach. As the result of this and subsequent
                    efforts,-Dr. Scott, Rev. W. W. Robertson and Rev. William Graham preached here occasionally for
                    upwards of six months until the summer of 1839.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1839 some of the brethren of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> began to open the way for the organization of a church by making regular appointments
                    here, and on the 8th of August Revs. John W. Scott, W. W. Robertson (now in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>) and William Graham (now in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>), commenced a protracted meeting, intending to form a church before it closed, should
                    the way be clear. On Sabbath, the 11th, they received four by letter and thirteen by examination,
                    formed them into a church and administered to them the sacrament of the Lord's supper. M.
                    W. Hail and William McCleery were chosen and ordained to the office of ruling elder. In October of
                    the same year the church solicited the services of Rev. William J. Patterson, a licentiate of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> Presbytery, and he commenced his labors on the last Sabbath of January following
                    (1840). He was elected pastor in the early part of the next autumn and was ordained and installed by
                    the Presbytery of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, November 19, 1840.</p>
            <p>He continued pastor of this church until his death, September <pb n="41" id="VAA4025-005-1-047"/> 20,
                    1844. Possessed of respectable talents, of sound judgment, of deep and ardent piety, and of lovely
                    and attractive manners, he won the affection and esteem of all who knew him, and died in the midst
                    of his days, lamented by all the friends of true religion in this community and by his brethren in
                    the ministry. None saw him but to love, none knew him but to praise. The savor of a blameless life,
                    of a godly walk and conversation, and of a deeply religious spirit still remained, and his name
                    still lingers in the memory of an affectionate flock. Truly may it be said of him, to this day,
                    "His works do follow him." Truly it may be said of him, as of his Master, that
                    even those who watched his words and conduct with an evil eye "could find no occasion
                    against him." His remains are buried in the graveyard belonging to the church.</p>
            <p>Soon after the commencement of his ministry, the congregation purchased and fitted up the house
                    formerly occupied by the Methodist Episcopal Church, and received as a donation from William W.
                    Butler a piece of ground adjoining it for a burying place. During the four and a half years that he
                    labored here there were added to the church, on examination 26, on certificate 16, infant baptisms
                    10, adult baptisms 12. The total number of communicants at his death was about 45. Five ruling
                    elders were added to the session, viz., William Patterson (father of the pastor), John Adams,
                    Ephraim Bennett and Amos D. Martin.</p>
            <p>Early in the winter of 1844-'45, Rev. John Gilchrest commenced his labors as a stated supply
                    in this church, and continued until the spring of 1847, dividing his time for the first few months
                    between <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bath. He removed to Dunlapsville, of which church he is still pastor. During his
                    ministry the church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvaniaburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> was dissolved and the members were received to this church. Including these there were
                    added on examination 3, on certificate 9, infant baptisms 15, adult baptisms 2.</p>
            <p>Rev. L. D. Potter commenced his labors November 20, 1847, and removed to Dunlapsville to take charge
                    of the Presbyterial <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-005-1-048"/> Academy located in that place, September 1,
                    1853. He divided his time for one and a half years between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bath; for one and a half years after this between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a missionary field west and south until the organization of the Metamora Church;

                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Metamora. He was installed pastor of the united churches in the fall of 1851.</p>
            <p>The present house of worship was commenced, enclosed and the basement occupied previous to his
                    removal. There were added during his ministry of nearly six years, on examination 68, on certificate
                    20, infant baptisms 40, adult baptisms 33.</p>

            <p rend="center">THE STATE LIBRARY AND THE ARCHIVES DEPARTMENT.</p>
            <p>The Indiana legislature of 1909, by lack of provision for the continuation of the work of the
                    Archives Department of the State Library, has probably necessitated the dropping of that work in the
                    near future. This is to be regretted, not only by those interested in Indiana history, but by the
                    general public. A well developed archives department is getting to be recognized as a necessity in
                    most of the States. It forms the best means of keeping the official records of the State, which in
                    Indiana, before the creation of this department, were for the most part inaccessible and often
                    destroyed.</p>
            <p>The department has but fairly begun this work in this State, and only those who know what is
                    accomplished in other States will appreciate the loss involved in its discontinuance. It is to be
                    hoped that the next legislature will restore this important work.</p>
            <p>While this subject is under discussion, it will perhaps not be out of place to suggest that an
                    agitation by all concerned be begun now and kept up until it has accomplished its object, for the
                    erection of an adequate State Library building, and the establishment not only of an archives
                    department as it now exists, but of the other forms of library and historical work done in other
                    progressive States, such as <placeName>

            <p>The regular annual meeting of the society was held in the law offices of its president, Judge D. W.

                    </placeName>, Thursday, December 31, 1908, at 2 in the afternoon. The president's report
                    showed an enrollment in the society of eighty-nine regular and twelve honorary members. The
                    publication during the year of the following papers was reported: "Making a Capital in the
                    Wilderness," by D. W. Howe; "Names of Persons Enumerated in <placeName>

                    thousand copies of each being printed. The executive committee reported $233.75 of the
                    legislative appropriation available for publications of the year ending October 1, 1909. The
                    treasurer reported $3,000 in the permanent endowment fund and $370.57 cash on
                    hand. The Indiana Quarterly Magazine of History reported having received from the society last year
                    $110, and the guarantee of $150, if necessary, for the year 1909 was renewed
                    by vote of the society. The committee upon Revolutionary pensioners reported that 1172 had been
                    located in Indiana. The following officers were elected for the year 1909: President, D. W. Howe;
                    first vice-president, Charles W. Moores; second vice-president, W. E. English; third vice-president,

            <p>At a meeting of the executive committee on January 29th the society pledged itself to contribute its

            <p>Steps will probably be taken soon to organize a local committee to take charge of the arrangements.

            <p>Mrs. Levering's book is one of the most pretentious yet published upon Indiana history. It
                    is, as" the sub-title implies, not a continuous history of this State, but
                    "chapters in the story of the Hoosier State, from a romantic period of foreign exploration
                    and dominion, through pioneer days, stirring war times and periods of peaceful progress, to the
                    present time." It is written with enthusiastic appreciation of the achievements of Indiana
                    people and of the 'characteristics of Indiana stock.</p>
            <p>Some of the more interesting chapters are: "How Spanish Rule Affected Indiana,"
                    "Picturesque Indiana," "An Indiana Type" (an account of Albert
                    Henderson, of the family of the authoress), "Letters and Art in Indiana,"
                    "The State Civilization in Indiana, as Shown by Her Laws." There are in all
                    twenty-two chapters, which deal each with some particular phase of Indiana's history or of
                    natural features of the State.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Levering, besides having the advantage of "life-long familiarity with the scenes and
                    characters and movements of the events mentioned," has also consulted and used most of the
                    literature on Indiana history. The technical historian would perhaps call for a larger use of
                    strictly original matter, but the general reader, for whom the book is most intended, will gain as
                    much interest and information as from any other book dealing with the subject.</p>
            <p>The religious history of the State has for the most part been entirely neglected by authors of
                    Indiana histories. It is interesting to have the subject at least briefly touched upon by Mrs.
                    Levering, although her chapter upon-"Early Churches in Indiana," by no means
                    attempts to give a full account of even the early religious development of the State, and makes no
                    attempt <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-005-1-054"/> to estimate the significant features of religious life
                    in this part of the country.</p>
            <p>Of the book as a whole it is not too much to say that it is the most important publication upon
                    Indiana history since Mr. J. P. Dunn's "Indiana." It is written in a most
                    interesting way, and is well proportioned. It contains a large fund of information, occasionally
                    lacking perhaps in definiteness and references for verification, but undeniably more reliable than
                    the average State or local history. The illustrations are largely reproductions of old prints, views
                    of Indiana scenery and buildings. There are too few maps, and hardly as many pictures of
                    distinguished personages as might have been used. But the book is distinctly well illustrated. In
                    fact, the publishers have done their work well, as has the authoress, and the result is a book
                    admirable in every respect.</p>
            <p>A good index and a short bibliography, including many–though by no means all–of
                    the most important works upon Indiana history or phases of it, add to the value of the work.</p>
