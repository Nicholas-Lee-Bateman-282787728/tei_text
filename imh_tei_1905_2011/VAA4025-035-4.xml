            <p>Indiana has been the home of the landscape painter, because of the natural background of hills and
                    hollows, foliage and skylines. Painters have found these a natural interest. Artists from distant
                    places as well as native sons have often been brought under the spell of Hoosier landscapes.
                    Frequently they have come to Indiana by chance and have been so fascinated by a particular locality
                    that they have become permanent residents. Consequently, artists have settled in various parts of
                    the state. Some work in groups, and some individually, wherever there is hope of achievement. As in
                    the early history of art in Europe, where artists congregated in active towns or cities, art
                    interest developed in Hoosier towns and cities in a natural way. Among these are

            <p>Some painters, as did the poet Riley, have delighted in depicting "the native son"
                    in his simple provincial mode of life. It is not surprising then that artists of all
                    kinds—etchers, sculptors, portrait painters, and figure painters—have made <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> a rendevous. Four artists, upon their return from study and travel in Europe, exerted a
                    special influence on the development of a characteristic Hoosier art. They were J. Otis Adams,
                    William Forsyth, Otto Stark, and Theodore C. Steele.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Each by his example <list type="footnotes">

                            with in this article, but they, as well as Mr. Steele, were teachers and leaders in the art
                            move-nent in Indiana. They studied abroad, but, before their return to the <placeName>

                            </placeName>, they decided that the material for art inspiration was practically
                            inexhaustible in their home state. It was while at a display of the work of American artists
                            In a Munich art gallexy that Forsyth and Adams agreed to this truth. and thw there
                            determined to come home to paint in Indiana. Adams located in <placeName>

                            had a studio together at Broakville, Indiana, for a brief period, and Adama retained a
                            studio there till his death. Mr. Steele left <placeName>

                            </placeName> to work for a while at what became the John Herron Art Institute. Forsyth

                    theme of art.</p>
            <p>Mr. Steele was among the first to appreciate the scenic possibilities of the state. He was a pioneer
                    in the sense that he used the entire state as a field of egpression. He worked in
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">North Vernon</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
               </placeName>, and, finally, he was the first painter in
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> hills. The old Munich tradition had made a profound impression upon him. His art was a
                    development of European traditions influenced by a characteristic Hoosier background and tempered by
                    an independent will. As a painter, he went into <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> about 1907. At that time, it was so remote and inaccessible because it had no railroads
                    or good highways that it had been less affected by change than any other part of the state. There
                    Mr. Steele developed his ideals unharrassed. Public elements interested in art were soon intrigued
                    by his landscapes of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> hills, old beeches, and rustic rail fences. More and more attention began to be focused
                    on this region.</p>
            <p>Frank Hohenberger has done a great deal to make the public conscious of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName>. He originally went there for his health, but, being an artist with his camera, he soon
                    photographed landscape compositions and outstanding characters in and near the county seat. A sense
                    of humor and an appreciation of the homespun philosophy of the natives caused him to write a series
                    of newspaper articles in which he used the pictures to illustrate the unaffected atmosphere of the
                    region. People were both curious and interested in the quaint, little town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for as we all know, it is only too seldom that anything remains unchanged in the midst
                    of change. Mr. Hohenberger was really pointing out opportunities to those who were interested in
                    such an out of the way place.</p>

                            <p>Once when the four artids were exhibiting with the Society of Western Artists. a critic
                                spoke. of them as the "Hoosier Four." The name stayed with them and
                                their coöperation and friendship incrensrd. Because each gave of his time and
                                talent to make pnblic contacts, exhibits and lectures, art appreciation grew in Indiana.

                                Their influence and enthusiasm were typical of their love of art and have been
                                instrumental in directing the course of art development in Indiana.</p>

                    </placeName>. Early in her career, she became interested in idealistic figure work. She built her
                    work around the native mother and child theme, painting local madonnas. She stood out in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Art colony as the one who first attempted, as a figure painter, to build the theme
                    around the use of the figure or figures. In this she worked in contrast to the portrait painter who
                    builds his theme around the characteristics of likeness of the particular sitter or sitters at the
                    sacrifice of any other possibilities in the theme. At the time of her death in 1928, she had gained
                    great recognition in her work.</p>
            <p>Another seasoned painter, Adolph Robert Schulz, migrated from the dairy country of <placeName>

                    because "the cows ate up the landscape." He returned, however, to his native
                    environment after having studied in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>,
                            <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
               </placeName>, and Munich, but the encroaching
                    dairying industry made it necessary for him to seek new haunts. He discovered <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> as a result of a series of walks through Indiana. He is academically trained and has

                    purchased by the Canadian Government. As a serious painter of landscape, he experiments with it from

                    </placeName>. He was a newspaper illustrator, but painting and etching were hobbies that later
                    became his profession. His paintings have won considerable recognition through his exhibitions and
                    prizes. Then there is Mary H. Vawter. She established a studio on Hill Top road. Her chief
                    contributions are landscapes with an occasional portrait.</p>

                    painting, but she also enjoys painting still life, particularly flowers. Recently, however, portrait
                    painting has left her little time for other interests. She studied extensively in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in various eastern art centers. Her varied talents make her a most versatile person
                    in that she can play and sing very beautifully as well as paint. For a time, she considered
                    seriously entering the concert world, but perhaps an inborn timidity led her to express her great
                    love for the beautiful in painting, which permits her to live more quietly. It is not surprising

                    </placeName>, she decided that this would be an ideal place to work. She and her sister, Genevieve
                    Goth, took a cabin where they could both work and rest.</p>
            <p>The latter, now Genevieve Goth Graf,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> as a close companion to her sister also has
                    that great love for beauty which has found expression in still life painting and wood carving. Her
                    pictures, though a bit different from the average, still live because she develops art themes from
                    articles of common usage in daily life. These are most fascinating because she is well versed in
                    both traditional pattern and color.</p>
            <p>Edward K. Williams was a commercial artist in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but, as a result of the study of painting in both oil and water color as a hobby,
                    painting was to become his profession. As a commercial artist, he developed a series of poster
                    stamps in which he ignored traditional characteristics common to that type of work. His success in

                    </placeName> more stimulating than <placeName>

            <p>Another "old timer" in the art colony is Carl C. Graf. Having been born and reared
                    in southern Indiana, his interests lay where he found a wide variety of country that was typical of
                    what he had known and loved in his youth. By nature he is idealistic and poetic with a great love
                    for the open country. After a period of preparation in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
               </placeName>, and
                    the East, he selected <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> for his rural studio because of the immense variety of material and the seclusion from
                    the confusion and din of the commercial world. Whether the landscape is realistic or poetic, he
                    finds there the opportunity to develop his special interests.</p>
            <p>Photography was the hobby that ultimately drew Curry Bohm to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was born in the South, the son of an artist, but was denied early training in art
                    because of strenuous parental objections. Later, however, he studied in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he worked as a photographer. At first, he was satisfied to hunt out the scenic
                    spots in and around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Each visit was more intriguing until at last he made it his residence that he might
                    continue his artistic pursuits. As a painter, he is profoundly influenced by poetry. His themes are
                    often developed as an inspiration from nature rather than the realism of nature. In summer, he
                    directs the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he soon found it to be his major interest. His landscapes are widely distributed
                    throughout the country and his name has come to be a familiar one in many art circles.</p>
            <p>Italian born Varaldo J. Carrani is another landscape and flower painter of note, invariably

                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName>. He was well schooled in the East and came to Indiana as a result of friends made while
                    a student in the East. His inherent love for gay colors, mellowed by an appreciative soul, make his
                    landscapes and flower pictures delightful and interesting to all lovers of art.</p>
            <p>Hill Top School has been a medium of expression for Mrs. Musette Osler Stoddard since she is
                    primarily interested <pb n="370" id="VAA4025-035-4-008"/> in art as a teacher. This is a fertile
                    field for her initiative, for here, basketry, ceramics, weaving, and sketching are taught.</p>
            <p>George La Chance is another artist who was first a photographer with painting as a hobby. He was

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Like a number of others with similar hobbies, his interest in both portrait
                    painting and landscape grew until they became his profession.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> locality has brought a number of seasonal painters from various places. Some of the
                    better known of these are: Paul Sargent from <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and Leota Loop, the well known flower painter from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana.</p>
            <p>Perhaps Lucy Hartrath of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> is the most widely known of all artists that come and go with the alternating seasons.

                  <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
               </placeName>, and Munich. Very early in her career, she became interested
                    in Hoosier landscapes. Her annual visits to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> began about twenty years ago and she has identified herself with it ever since.</p>
            <p>The fact that these artists have organized the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> Art Gallery Association with specific qualifications for membership has increased
                    public interest in their work. It has enabled the members to display a continuous exhibition that is
                    fairly representative of the work of the group. About fifteen painters maintain studios or
                    residences within a short distance of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other members, even though they are not in residence, maintain a close working
                    relationship with the Association. These artists exhibit their work in various representative
                    exhibitions and private collections throughout the country. Their contributions are quite
                    diversified in nature, in subject matter, and in interpretation. NO doubt the talents of this rather
                    heterogeneous group are tempered by the influence of the environment upon them. The part that <placeName>

                    popularity, it must be assumed that this verdant country and the naive natives have made an
                    indelible impression.</p>

            <p>Pursuant to an enabling act passed six months previously, Indiana adopted a state constitution on

                    </placeName> by Governor Jonathan Jennings and laid before Congress on January 9, 1817.</p>
            <p>It was on March 6, 1817, that Benjamin Parke was appointed as judge of the <placeName>

                    of Congress passed three days before. The new judge was a native of <placeName>

               </placeName>, where
                    he studied law. After coming to Indiana, he soon became a warm friend and supporter of the
                    territorial Governor, William Henry Harrison, who appointed him to the office of Attorney General of
                    the territory, which office he held from August 4, 1804, until June 2, 1808, serving in the meantime
                    as a representative in the territorial legislature during the sessions of 1805 and 1806, as
                    territorial delegate to Congress from December 12, 1805, until April 23, 1808, and then as one of
                    the territorial judges. He was also territorial chancellor from June 14, 1813, to October 1, 1814.
                    While holding the judgeship, he is said to have ridden once on horseback through the forest from <placeName>

                    Harrison's army with the rank of major. He also repeatedly served as an Indian agent and
                    commissioner in negotiating treaties with the Indians. He was a delegate to the convention which
                    framed the Constitution of 1816, in which he is said to have exercised great influence. After the
                    admission of Indiana, which terminated his service as a territorial judge, he was commissioned as
                    president judge for a few weeks in the first district, composed of Gibson, <placeName>

                    for he is recorded as having been commissioned on January 15, 1817, and as having resigned in each
                    of those counties on February 8, 1817. He became the federal district judge four weeks later.
                    Federal litigation would not appear to have been very heavy in the early days of statehood, since
                    the first case was recorded in the district court after the lapse of more than two years, when an
                    indictment against Andrew Hilton was returned on May 4, 1818, for selling whiskey without paying the
                    tax. A jury found the defendant not guilty.</p>

                    seized because of illegal trading with the Indians. It was tried on January 5, 1825, one half the
                    goods being awarded to the informer. Judge Parke served until his death on July 13, 1835, in his
                    fifty-seventh year. For some time before his death, he suffered a partial paralysis. The marked
                    change in his signatures, as they appear on the records, would indicate that he had grown quite
                    feeble at the last, though continuing to hold court.</p>
            <p>Judge Monks, in his <hi rend="i">Courts and Lawyers of Imdiana</hi>, says that Judge Parke was one of
                    the two best lawyers in the Constitutional Convention of 1816, and one of its most influential
                    members. Oliver H. Smith says, in his <hi rend="i">Early Indiana</hi>
                    <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-035-4-011"/>
                    <hi rend="i">Trials and Sketches</hi>, that Parke "was a fair, but not a great
                    lawyer," adding that he "made a first-rate judge; patient, courageous and
                    kind," and commending the judge for his honesty and common sense, which should make a judge
                    useful, if it does not otherwise especially distinguish him.</p>

                    under the belief that novel reading was harmful. He studied law in the office of Henry Clay, at <placeName>

                    appear. In 1814 he was a representative at the special session of the territorial legislature in
                    June, and a legislative councilor at the regular session in August, being elected president of the
                    council. On September 14 of the same year, the settled portion of the territory being districted
                    into three judicial circuits, he was appointed by Governor Harrison as presiding judge of the courts
                    of the second circuit, composed of the counties of Clark, Harrison, Jefferson and <placeName>

                    State of Indiana, for which place he was that day confirmed by the Senate. His commission as Judge
                    of the Supreme Court was dated December 28, 1816, and he served two seven-year terms, but Governor

                    receiving fifty-five votes. The highest vote received by Holman on any ballot was forty-two. Judge
                    Holman now retired to private life for a few years. The death of Judge Parke four years later was
                    followed by the appointment of Judge Holman as <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    28, 1842. He was one of a board of twenty-two trustees chosen by the legislature to take over the
                    Indiana College at <placeName>

                    the legislature named an entirely new board of only nine trustees.</p>
            <p>Judge Holman continued to be a preacher while advancing through all the gradations of law student,
                    practicing lawyer, prosecuting attorney, legislator and judge, preaching as opportunity offered and
                    duty called. He served as pastor of the Baptist Church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                    </placeName> for several years preceding <pb n="375" id="VAA4025-035-4-013"/> his death. Doubtless
                    all of his service to his church was gratuitous. In August, 1815, while he was a presiding judge,
                    holding court with the assistance in each county of two associate judges, Jesse L. Holman advertised
                    a sale on Septemben 4, 1815, of lots in the new town of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur</region>

                    </placeName>. Four years later, when he was one of the judges of our newly created Supreme Court, he
                    became the active head of an organization of speculators, most of whom resided in <placeName>

                    miles farther down the river, Judge Holman gave as his reason for choosing the new name that "<placeName>

                    1836. He served three terms in the lower House of Congress, from 1843 to 1849, and was a nominee of
                    the newly formed Republican Party in 1856 for presidential elector. Four years later, he presided at

                    his body is now buried is unknown. It is said to have been buried in the old cemetery on <placeName>

                    railroad executive.</p>
            <p>At about this time, his activity in constructing and operating railroads appears to have ceased, but
                    the practice was then followed of naming locomotives, as had been customary with steamboats, instead
                    of merely numbering them; and the Albert S. White locomotive continued to bear his name until the
                    time of his death. That it also carried his picture on its headlight is attested by a note attached
                    to such a picture (about 12 by 18 inches) in the <placeName>

                    headlight" of that locomotive from 1854 until 1864.</p>
            <p>Judge White was made a trustee of Indiana University in 1846 and served until 1851. He was again
                    elected to Congress in 1860, but was defeated for renomination in 1862, his defeat being attributed
                    to his earnest stand in favor of emancipation. He was appointed by President Lincoln to succeed
                    Judge Caleb B. Smith as <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    judge of the district court for only a few months before the summer vacation. The first entry in the
                    Order Book bearing his signature was on March 8, 1864, and the last was in June when court adjourned
                    for the summer. His last public service was at the ceremonial dedication of Crown Hill Cemetery at <placeName>

                    funeral ceremonies. Judge White is remembered as a successful advocate, ranking high as a beginner
                    among the circuit-riding bar. Judge Monks says in his <hi rend="i">Courts and Lawyers of

            <p>David McDonald was appointed to succeed Judge White and took the oath of office on December 13, 1864.

                    in the religious body known as New Lights. He was elected as a state representative in 1833. From
                    December 4, 1834, until he resigned on August 17, 1837, he was prosecuting attorney for the Seventh
                    Circuit, which then embraced the ten counties of <placeName>

            <p>On January 28, 1839, Judge McDonald was chosen by the legislature, as provided in the constitution of
                    1816, to a seven-year term as president judge of the tenth circuit, newly created by redistricting
                    the state into eleven circuits where there had been only nine. On. taking possession of this office,

                    president judge of the old seventh circuit, Elisha M. Huntington, therefore preceded Judge McDonald
                    on the circuit bench, with an interval of less than two years between them, and was in turn followed
                    by him as Judge of the Federal District Court. Judge Huntington, as we have seen, resigned on July
                    12, 1841, from the circuit court for the seventh circuit to go to <placeName>

                    as a president judge until October 12, 1852, when he was succeeded by Alvin P. Hovey, afterwards
                    Governor of Indiana, who had been elected as judge by popular vote under the provisions of the newly
                    adopted constitution of 1851 that is still in force. In 1852, Judge McDonald was a candidate for
                    election as a judge of the state supreme court and ran ahead of his ticket, but was defeated. During
                    all of his term as prosecuting attorney and until after the close of his first term as circuit
                    judge, there was not a railroad nor even an improved highway in any of the counties that he served
                    and he traveled his circuit on horseback.</p>

                    </placeName> district judge for Indiana in 1864, he would seem to have been conducting a private law
                    school; and, forty-five years ago, it was asserted that he continued to do so at least for a time
                    after he was appointed. In 1841, while he was president judge of the tenth circuit, including <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName>, Judge McDonald accepted an appointment as the first law professor of Indiana
                    University, by which name the former "college" at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>

                    of December, 1842, he "read the first law lecture ever read in this state." It
                    seems, however, that others had been previously elected by the board of trustees to the position of
                    law professor, Judge Miles C. Eggleston, former Representative Tilghman A. Howard being reported as
                    declining to accept the position when chosen. Judge Isaac Blaclrfcrd, who in 1852 ended a term of

            <p>Judge McDonald served on the faculty of the law school until 1852, being all of the time a circuit
                    court judge. He quit his professorship five years after the first railroad reached <placeName>

                    through lines into and across adjoining states. In fact, it was only five years after the beginning
                    of the era of plank road and turnpike building in the older settlements, when the flood of
                    incorporations for that purpose by special acts had run as high as sixty-six in a year (1851),
                    besides companies formed under the general law.</p>
            <p>These acts allowed four or five or more years within which to complete an improvement, but so far as
                    the writer's knowledge goes, none of them was ever constructed in the counties constituting
                    the tenth judicial circuit. Judge McDonald's public service to the state as judge in a
                    circuit of eight counties was given on a dirt road basis of probably three miles an hour, with
                    substantially a whole day consumed in traveling from one county seat town to another. He removed to <placeName>

                    published in 1857. After repeated revisions, this book is still recognized as an authority on the
                    powers and duties of Justices of the Peace and practice in justices' cqurts. In 1855 and
                    1856, he served as a trustee of Indiana University. In the latter year, Judge McDonald was chosen as

                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on March 17, 1832. He was a student at Indiana University for a short time,
                    but left without graduating and studied law in an office in Corydon, a frequent method of acquiring
                    a legal education in the Middle West ninety years ago. Admitted to the bar in 1853, at twenty-one
                    years of age, he practiced his profession for half a dozen years, when he became a member of the
                    legislature in 1860, an officer of the volunteer army in 1861, state financial agent in 1867,
                    district judge in 1869, cabinet officer in 1883, circuit judge in 1884, and again a member of the
                    President's Cabinet in 1893. He died on May 28, 1895, without ever having engaged actively
                    in the practice of the law, except for the first few years of his professional life. During his
                    service in the army, he was repeatedly a member of courts martial, where his learning and skill as a
                    lawyer were called into play. One court martial in which he participated was that of Colonel Thomas
                    Worthington, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, accused of issuing a pamphlet charging <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-035-4-022"/> his
                    superior officer with having disobeyed an order of General Grant in command at the Battle of <placeName>

            <p>Colonel Gresham was barely thirty years old in 1862, while the court martial included three brigadier
                    generals and three colonels, all his seniors. The truth or falsity of what was charged in the
                    pamphlet was not inquired into, its publication while the army was facing an enemy being adjudged to
                    constitute insubordination, for which Colonel Worthington was dismissed from the army. Colonel
                    Gresham maintained that, since the commanding officer who had preferred the charges and who
                    testified at the trial had appointed the members of the Court, Colonel Worthington's denial
                    of the accuser's right, even in time of war, to bring an officer to trial before a court
                    the members of which had been chosen by such accuser, should be sustained. Five years later the
                    order of dismissal was revoked, and Colonel Worthington was permitted tol resign as of the date when
                    it had been approved. Notwithstanding his limited experience at the bar and his political
                    activities, Judge Gresham took high rank as a judge during his fourteen years on the district bench
                    and eight years as a circuit judge. Dying at <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, whose younger sister was married in 1896 to his law partner, Benjamin Crane. The <placeName>

                    Anderson practiced his profession twenty-one years, until appointed <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> district judge. He was a man of wide reading, which with his practice at the bar in
                    Indiana, added greatly to his qualifications both as a trial judge and as a chancellor. His judicial
                    work in equity cases, while not so spectacular as in jury trials, was appreciated and admired by the
                    bar and by others under whose notice it came. His integrity was never doubted. When he seemed
                    severe, it was the severity required by the faithful performance of duty. He wrote few opinions, but
                    not infrequently would orally announce from the bench his reasons for a decision or a ruling that he
                    was making. His worth <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-035-4-025"/> was often recognized by assignments to

            <p>The first white settler at Orland, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Steuben County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, was John Stocker of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> in 1834. In 1835 many other settlers arrived from the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> and built their log cabins along Crooked Creek, now called "<geogName>Fawn
                        River</geogName>." Those most prominent, with their families, were Benjamin Pierce, the
                    Parmenters, the Wards, the Coes, Captain Barry and others. The Cabin of John Stocker was the third
                    erected in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Steuben County</region>
                    </placeName>, and Orland, then known as the "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> Settlement," was the first settlement in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Steuben County</region>
                    </placeName>. The first white child born in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Steuben County</region>
                    </placeName> was Sarah L. Pierce who afterwards became the wife of Alsinus Townsend. Miss Eliza
                    Eaton was the first school teacher (1836). She afterwards married Augustus Kimball and was the first
                    bride of the settlement. The wedding ceremony was conducted by J. M. Hall, a Baptist minister.</p>
            <p>These early settlers came to Indiana over the Vistula Highway which was to northern Indiana what the
                    National Road was to central Indiana. The Vistula Highway is in the program of improved highways and
                    in a short time will be paved across the state. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> Settlement prospered from the start and developed many industries, such as a pump
                    factory, a woolen mill, a carriage factory, a flour and corn mill, a brick factory, a crockery
                    factory and a chair factory. At that time, Coldwater, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, twenty miles away had but one log cabin. The post office was established in 1837 and
                    Alexander Chapin was the first postmaster. The people of this community have always been an honest,
                    hospitable, thrifty, religious and God-fearing people. Yes, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> community was one of culture and from the first established churches and schools. In
                    1850, an academy was established at Orland known as the North Eastern Literary Institute. It was
                    prominent for several years as one of the outstanding educational institutions of the state.</p>
            <p>This country was then, and is now, a part of the finest hunting and fishing area of Indiana and here
                    the Potta-watomi Indians under their Chieftain Baw Beese roamed the country at will. Wall Lake, one
                    and one-half miles west of Orland, where the wrfter has a summer home, was named <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-035-4-027"/> after a wall erected by the Indians on its west shore and where their
                    main camp was located. The author has many arrow heads and Indian trinkets that have been picked up
                    n that neighborhood. Pottawatomi Inn at Pokagon Park was named after the Indian tribe of that name.
                    When the post office was established it was named "Millgrove" but it was
                    discovered that there was another post office in the state by the same name, and it was agreed at a
                    "Singing-School" that the teacher should open the song-book, and that the first
                    tune which should greet his eyes would become the name of the town. Lo and behold! The first tune
                    was that old, old hymn, "Orland"; and that became the name of the village, believe
                    it or not!</p>
            <p>Another matter of historical interest is the attitude of Orland in the Civil War. The people living
                    there were always anti-slavery and had one of the most noted Under-Ground Railroad stations in the
                    North. It is too long a story to go into here, but there is a tradition that Eliza Harris of <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> fame was kept over night in Orland on her way to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>A further item of history relating to Orland is its record holding postmaster by the name of
                    Christian Schneider. He was postmaster under the following national administrations, namely: those
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pierce, James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rutherford</settlement>
                    </placeName> B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chester</settlement>
                    </placeName> A. Arthur, Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Benjamin Harrison. Is not that one for the "Book"? Mr. Schneider
                    was a tailor by trade, and, for more than forty-five years, had more to do with the life of the
                    community than any other person who ever lived there. At his home on Vistula Street, he had a
                    sun-dial and a bell, and, in all that period of years, Postmaster Schneider never missed ringing
                    that bell at six in the morning and at noon. He rang curfew at eight in the evening and the people
                    set their timepieces accordingly. That old bell is in the City Library at Orland now and highly
                    treasured. The historical facts of this wonderful section of Indiana have been skimmed over lightly,
                    but the community and surrounding country are surely worth visiting.</p>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Air Mail Service is a branch of the Post Office Department in which certain classes of
                    mail are transported and delivered over officially established lines under the supervision of the
                    federal government. These routes at present extend in every direction throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and into many foreign countries.</p>
            <p>The first government record of an experiment for an established air mail route was a service from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> on May 15, 1918, which was operated for a short time. Encouraged by the success of this
                    venture, other lines were soon in operation. So rapid wa+s the expansion of this service that it was
                    found advisable to transfer the transportation of air mail to contracts with private operators under
                    government restrictions. This plan has been continued to the present time with the exception of a
                    short period when, by reason of certain irregularities in management and numerous fatalities through
                    accidents, the service was temporarily transferred to the War Department. As this change did not
                    prove satisfactory, the service was returned to operation by private companies.</p>
            <p>At the present time, special air mail is extensively carried by aeroplane, which method will probably
                    be further developed and the bulk of air mail increased in the future. While we should be proud of
                    this wonderful accomplishment, the fact remains that the earliest experiments in aerial navigation
                    were made in a free flying balloon. From this beginning, there followed a gradual evolution
                    extending over a period of one hundred fifty years. First there was the crude paper affair of the
                    Montgolfier Brothers in 1783, followed by the devices of Blanchard and Jeffries who drifted across
                    the English Channel from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dover</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Calais in 1785. The next important advance was made by Charles Green, an Englishman,
                    who, in 1836, made an ascension at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> and landed 500 miles from that city. This venture was eclipsed by Henry Gifford in
                    1878, using a balloon of a capacity of 450,000 cubic feet. Gifford is also said to have invented the
                    first successful dirigible, but the credit for inventing the modern lighter-than-air dirigible must
                    be given to Count von Zeppelin, who, in 1910, completed his first passenger machine.</p>
            <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-035-4-029"/>
            <p>A most important discovery was made by the Montgolfier family when they found that smoke and hot air
                    could be utilized as a lifting power for balloons. Then followed the discovery of the properties of
                    hydrogen gas by Cavendish in 1766, which, by reason of its greater buoyancy, was more suitable for
                    that purpose. The early cost of manufacturing this gas, however, made its employment prohibitive,
                    and, until a cheaper process of production was discovered, the employment of coal gas or hot air was
                    used. Then hydrogen came into use, but, as it is dangerously inflammable, helium is considered more
                    desirable for lighter than air craft.</p>
            <p>The earliest record of air mail transportation in Europe was at the siege of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1871, during; the Franco-Prussian War, when nine tons of dispatches and three
                    million letters were sent out in sixty-four free flying balloons. Fifty-seven of these fell in
                    friendly territory and the mail eventually reached its destination. Gambetta left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> by one of these balloons to secure an army of relief.</p>
            <p>Unsatisfactory results with the free flying balloon led to the development, in 1910, of the dirigible
                    of the Zeppelin type. It was a few years before this date (December 17, 1903) that the Wright
                    Brothers, Wilbur and Orville, made the first successful flight from Kittyhawk and their success on
                    this occasion marks the birth of the modern aeroplane. The story of the conquest of the sky has been
                    most dramatic. Though there has been a considerable loss of life and frequently planes have crashed
                    to their destruction, progress has continued and air travel is now a favorite method of
                    transportation.</p>
            <p>The story of how the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, played a part in the early history of air mail delivery is of much interest.
                    For a number of years John Wise, a professional balloonist of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>,
                    made exhibition flights in various parts of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He made a study of aviation as it was then practiced here and abroad. It was his
                    experience that there was little danger in a free flying balloon while it was in the air, but that,
                    on making a landing, personal injury frequently resulted from the basket dragging over obstacles on
                    the ground before the complete collapse of the bag. This danger was obviated by the device of the
                    "rip cord," which, by opening a panel of the balloon, resulted <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-035-4-030"/> in rapid deflation, and accidents due to the dragging of the basket
                    were reduced to a minimum. As a result of his wide experience, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wise</region>
                    </placeName> was led to believe that in the upper air there were currents like the trade winds which
                    constantly blow in the same direction, and he held that in the Middle West these currents in the
                    upper air took a course from West to East. This being the case, he believed that if a balloon could
                    be made capable of a sustained flight, transportation of passengers and light mail would be
                    .possible from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to Europe.</p>
            <p>To test his new theory, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wise</region>
                    </placeName> made an ascent from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1858 with the object of transporting express by air from that city to the Atlantic
                    Coast. This experiment was only a partial success as it was necessary to throw overboard the cargo
                    to prevent the balloon from falling into Lake <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="onc">Ontario</region>
                    </placeName>. Although mail on this trial trip ultimately reached its destination, it was not
                    sponsored by the federal post office but was an experiment by a private corporation.</p>
            <p>The following year, Mr. Wise planned an ascension from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and came to that city for the purpose in the summer of 1859. August 16 was set as the
                    date for the flight and a notice appeared in the local papers that letters and other mail would be
                    accepted by the flyer to be carried by his balloon <hi rend="i">Jupiter</hi> for delivery in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>On account of a slight accident, the ascension was not made on the appointed day, but took place on
                    the following day. The mail was delivered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and eventually reached its Eastern desination. The mail bag contained one hundred
                    twenty-three letters and twenty-three pamphlets. The conspicuous facts in this experiment (which

                        object being to reach if possible the Atlantic Shore. Mr. Wise will probably be accompanied by a

                        the Court House Square. The balloon Jupiter, in which the ascension is to be made, arrived
                        yesterday, and will be immediately re-coated and outfitted for a long voyage. It is now at Balls
                        Hall. Arrangements will be made on all the railroads leading to the City for the accommodation
                        of people from abroad who may desire to witness the ascension.</p>
                    <p>The ascension will take place on Tuesday and the 16th of the present month. The almanac makers
                        are unanimously of the opinion that the weather will be favorable on that day and the certainty
                        of moonlight is a propitious circumstance. The balloon will be inflated at the gas works on <placeName>

                        state) will furnish the requisite quantity of gas. As soon as the inflation is complete, the
                        balloon, properly secured against the contingency of a run away will be conveyed to the public
                        square, where the ascension will take place."</p>

            <p>The ascension so widely advertised for Aug. 16, 1859, proved a failure. The inflation took place in a
                    lot adjacent to the gas works and was completed by three o'clock in the afternoon in the
                    presence of the largest crowd ever assembled in <placeName>

                    effort to get over them, the balloon unfortunately got loose and mounted to the sky. As the
                    arrangements for the ascent were still incomplete, Prof. <placeName>

                    extricating the balloon from the telegraph wires. After repairing this defect, the local papers
                    announced that a second ascension would take place on the next day, which would be August 17.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Wise determined that the original program should be carried out, and yesterday announced that
                        a second attempt for the transcontinental trip would be made at two o'clock in the
                        afternoon. The air ship was fully inflated, and all the arrangements for the voyage perfected at
                        the appointed time, and precisely at the hour designated, Prof. <placeName>

                        the veteran aeronaut with loud and long continued cheers. The balloon rose very gracefully in
                        nearly perpendicular direction bearing slightly to the south until an altitude of probably a
                        mile and a quarter was reached when it bore to the southwest. It apparently reached a great
                        height; but it remained visible for nearly two hours when it finally disappeared in the dim
                        distance. The professor took with him about 300 pounds of ballast and was prepared for a long
                        voyage. He remarked when starting that he should not be satisfied with a trip of less than a
                        thousand miles in length. He had promised to telegraph us as soon after landing as possible.</p>

                        <salute>My dear Friend:</salute>
                        <p>Tomorrow I hope to send you a copy of my narrative. Till then you will please draw
                                    your own conclusions. I done [sic] full justice to the artesian circulars. I have
                                    still three bottles (artesian water). One I sent to Col. Forney with a note and he
                                    will probably mention it in the Monday press.</p>
                        <p>It was to me a remarkable trip—no ozone in the air, a deficiency I should
                                    think for healthful purposes.</p>
                        <p>I wrote to Joseph Dautzier today to forward me the balloon if he had not sold her.
                                    Several parties are after her at $300. When Mr. D. settled with my son he
                                    had only collected $625 and $25 for our hotel made all told
                                    $650.</p>
                        <p>I reached the upper current at bar of 19 inches but it had exhausted the balloon one
                                    half and this cost me all my sand ballast.</p>

            <p>This ascension of 1859 has some scientific interest. One of the earliest attempts to study the
                    chemistry of the upper atmosphere was made by Gay Lussac on Sept. 16, 1804. In the year 1840,
                    Schonbein discovered ozone in the atmosphere and studied its properties, and the origin of this
                    allotropic form of oxygen. The subject was of great interest to scientists at that time, so when <placeName>

                    following from Mr. Wise appeared: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In looking through the clouds I noticed a town a little to the west of me. By reference to my
                            chart it proved to be <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                            </placeName>. Knowing if there were no currents below I could safely and easily land in the
                            town, and in order to make the arrival more interesting, I concluded to send my mail ahead,
                            and to effect this in a systematic form the following expedient was adopted: Having with me
                            a muslin sheet nine feet square, I attached to each of its corners strings of about 5 yards
                            in length. These were tied together at their lower extremities and to this knot was attached
                            the mail bag and thefi I dropped it overboard. The muslin sheet made an admirable parachute.
                            A few minutes informed me that it would drift to a considerable distance to the south of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                            </placeName>, as there was a slight breeze below drifting in that direction. I pulled the
                            valve and Jupiter followed and soon overtook the mail. We kept together all the way down as
                            I could regulate the descent of the balloon to the descent of the parachute, and both of the
                            aerial machines landed within 50 feet of each other in the public road six miles south of <placeName>

            <p>The Society of Indiana Pioneers, organized on September 15, 1916, and incorporated on April 24, 1922,
                    has this motto: "TO honor the memory and the work of the pioneers who opened Indiana to
                    civilization." The requirements for membership in the Society state that men and women may
                    become members of the Society who have one or more lineal ancestors who lived in Indiana in pioneer
                    days—before 1825 in older counties, before later dates in counties organized later<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The symbols on the "pioneer pin" are most interesting. In the upper left-hand
                    corner is the felled tree of the pioneer; in the upper right-hand corner are the axe, the gun, and
                    the powder horn, which the pioneer used for protection and food. In the lower left-hand corner is
                    the fleeing buffalo, which is also a symbol on the state seal. This suggests the danger of the times
                    and the fact that the first roads were traces worn by migrating buffalo. The importance of the
                    pioneer mother is symbolized in the lower right-hand field by the spinning wheel. In the center of
                    the pin is the Indian-head. A <hi rend="i">fac simile</hi> of this pin is found on the front cover
                    of each <hi rend="i">Year Book</hi> of the Society, with the motto of the Society printed below.
                    This emblem was designed by Julia Finch Conner (Mrs. Charles N.) Thompson, who died on December 26,
                    1928.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Year Books</hi> of the Society are prized by all members and by others interested in
                    the history of the state who possess them. Each year an article on some phase of Indiana history is
                    featured. The article for the <hi rend="i">Year Book</hi> of 1939 was "The Harrison
                    Family," since the Society presented, on May 21–22 of last year, a pageant

                    pilgrimages are annual affairs that provide members of the Indiana Historical Society and friends
                    with opportunities to visit points of historic and scenic interest in the state.</p>
            <p>Each <hi rend="i">Year Book</hi> presents complete records of present and past officers, including
                    lists of boards of governors of the Society, a roll of deceased members, and committees appointed
                    for the year. In the membership list, below each name, is given the name of the pioneer from whom
                    the member is descended, with the place and year of the ancestor's birth and the place and
                    date of his settlement in Indiana. Notes in brackets give unusual items of interest regarding the
                    pioneers named.</p>
            <p>The Society of Indiana Pioneers has touched all phases of historical and cultural development of
                    Indiana. It has cooperated with historical and patriotic societies of the state in placing markers
                    and memorials, and in the preservation of relics, documents, and family records relating to Indiana.
                    The Society was one of the promoters of the building of the present State Library and Historical
                    Building to preserve the records of the state. It also cooperated in the promotion of the movement
                    for the restoration and maintenance by the state of the Lanier Home at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Society likewise encouraged and assisted the movement for a suitable memorial to
                    the memory of George Rogers Clark, and was represented on the Commission created for that purpose by
                    the Indiana General Assembly.</p>
            <p>In cooperation with the Indiana Historical Society and the Indiana Historical Bureau, the Society of
                    Indiana Pioneers promotes and sponsors the annual Indiana History Conference, which has probably
                    done more than any other activity to develop an interest in Indiana history. The Annual Conference
                    of 1939 (December 8–9) will be the twenty-first. Due to the increasing interest in family
                    history, a <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-035-4-040"/> special session at the conference is devoted to
                    Indiana genealogy. This is held in the Genealogy Room of the State Library. The Society of Pioneers,
                    along with the Historical Society and Indiana University, has made possible the publication of the
                    "Indiana Genealogy" section of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>.</p>
            <p>Each year, the closing event of the Indiana Histdry Conference is the Annual Dinner of the Society of
                    Indiana Pioneers. This is a notable social event that brings together a representative group of the
                    descendants of the founders of the state. Many of these descendants are leaders in public,
                    professional, business and social activities of today, as was stated by a former president of the
                    Society, William H. Insley. The Society exerts a real influence on the cultural life of the state.</p>
            <p>To its members, the Society of Indiana Pioneers not only offers the opportunity to honor their
                    pioneer ancestors, but also to pass on to their own descendants the heritage of a record of direct
                    descent from the pioneers and the pleasure of service with others in the preservation of records of
                    early families and the advancement of historical work.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    Cleave's excellent work appeared and asserting that Harrison's death after only a

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> may account for lack of interest in him and lack of well known biographical material,
                    he continues: "There is, of course the 'political biography' of him
                    written in 1926 by Mrs. Goebel and which is excellent in the phases covered but which was published
                    by a historical society and is largely unheard of by the general reader…. Both historians
                    and the public generally should be grateful to Mr. Cleaves for supplying them with a readily
                    obtainable and scholarly Life."</p>
            <p>The "political biography" written in 1926 by Mrs. Goebel happens to be Volume 14 of

                    While appreciating Mr. Adams' commendation of this work, one is given pause by the opinion
                    expressed that it is to be taken for granted that books published by a historical society are
                    largely unheard of by the general reader and are not readily obtainable. The correctness of Mr.
                    Adams' opinion cannot be truthfully challenged. One is led, however, to reflect upon the
                    reasons for this state of affairs and to search for ways of improving the circulation of material
                    published by historical organizations.</p>
            <p>One reason why historical publications are not more widely advertised than they are has been the
                    deprecation of their quality. Whether this judgment is fair or not is an open question. One is
                    inclined to think that it is largely due to the fact that historical society writings, in so far as
                    they reach readers, find a more critical reception than the books issued by commercial publishers
                    with a highly favorable "blurb" accompanying them. Leading members of societies
                    are often the most critical of the activities of their organizations. Such was Worthington C. Ford
                    in the paper which <pb n="404" id="VAA4025-035-4-042"/> he read at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> meeting of the Conference of Historical Societies in 1928, "Historical
                    Societies—Living and Dead," printed in the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                        </placeName> Valley Historical Review</hi> for December, 1929, and reprinted in a separate by
                    the Conference. His helpful diagnosis might easily be mistaken for condemnation in such sentences as
                    this, "At least one-half of what is printed by societies could better be left in
                    manuscript." It was not a condemnation, but rather a self-searching appeal for improvement.
                    Historical societies do actually discourage the publication of much material that is not worth
                    publication; that they do publish much that need not be put into print is true, but this is probably
                    no more true of them than of most publishing agencies. The demand for their publications is probably
                    as strong, relatively, as that for doctoral dissertations and privately printed books.</p>
            <p>The relatively small circulation of historical society publications is inherent in the very theory of
                    the activity of such an organization. Books which make a general appeal and have the promise of
                    sales which justify advertisement and the use of sales organizations ought to be published by
                    commercial publishers. Historical societies generally limit their publications to works which are
                    thought to be worth while, but do not hold the promise of such extensive sales as would give a
                    commercial publisher returns necessary for a profitable business. This is only another way of
                    restating Mr. Adams' inference as a generality.</p>
            <p>The only problem involved is that which arises when a historical society publication, which perhaps
                    has been or would be refused by a commercial publisher, meets a general demand. Since the society
                    has no paid advertising expert and no sales organization, the distribution of such a book is apt to
                    be as limited as that of more technical or less interesting publications. All of them are probably
                    noticed in the book trade journals, but few of them are given the publicity which commercial
                    publishers secure by glowing reviews in magazines and in literary supplements of newspapers; nor are
                    they displayed in bookstores—indeed, the decline of bookstores themselves in the last
                    thirty or forty years is one of the causes both for the swollen tide of "best
                    sellers" and the relatively small circulation of scholarly and scientific works.</p>
            <p>What can be done about it? In the first place, members of historical societies ought to serve as
                    advertising agents <pb n="405" id="VAA4025-035-4-043"/> for meritorious publications of their
                    organizations. The membership of such societies should be much larger than it is and their
                    activities should be made known by word of mouth, as well as by the efforts, often ineffective, of
                    the officers of the society to secure alluring printed notices. In the second place, concerted
                    effort ought to be made to secure fair recognition in popular magazines and in newspapers for
                    publications which deserve it, whether issued by friendly commercial publishers and advertisers or
                    by publishers in organizations outside the charm circle. Then the public also should be better
                    educated than it is in discriminating between worth-while publications and worthless ones. This must
                    necessarily be the work of schools and colleges. It is a practical goal that educators might well
                    set themselves to train their students in powers of discrimination and in methods of securing for
                    themselves objects of enduring value, rather than in taking what is thrust upon them by high-powered
                    salesmanship.</p>
            <p>It may be observed also that people interested in historical reading ought to subscribe to historical
                    magazines and read them. They are for the most part sent to members of the historical societies
                    which publish them and may be obtained by membership in those societies—a membership
                    which is open to all respectable citizens. Those who have read the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi> would certainly know about Mrs. Goebel's <hi rend="i">William Henry

            </byline>
            <p>There was at one time, in another state, a graduate student from a country of the Far East, who
                    enrolled in my course in American party history. At the end of the session, he did not seem to know
                    much about the leaders in our party history. Neither did he know much about the parties that have
                    developed and played their parts in the government of our country. Near the close of the summer, he
                    informed me that he knew little more at the beginning of the course than the names of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
               </placeName> and Jefferson. He was telling me the literal truth, and I was
                    forced to conclude, that, measured by the distance he had traveled from the day he entered my class,
                    he had done about as well as any other student. I will hazard the guess, too, that he has since
                    added much to his knowledge of American history, the institutions of the country, and the place of
                    parties in the scheme of democratic government in the modern world. What Sugiyami was able to do in
                    the summer of 1927, with almost no foundation whatever to build on, furnishes a subject for
                    reflection.</p>
            <p>Every teacher of history knows how imperfect the knowledge and understanding of a period can be for
                    many high school and college students after they have labored through a course. Students frequently
                    declare that they know little in a short time after completing almost any course, and they are
                    usually ready to add that they will soon know less. Many throw up their hands and ask,
                    "What's the use?" Keen and flippant critics alike encourage students to
                    regard lightly the value of courses they have taken. To some, education means nothing unless it
                    results in jobs, and no one can say that jobs are not important after living through the hectic
                    years since 1929. By others, education is heavily discounted because knowledge acquired is so
                    rapidly lost by most of those who have been granted high school or college diplomas, or both.
                    Certainly no one will argue that the high mortality rate on facts and ideas supposedly lodged in the
                    minds of students is not appalling. There is much more, of course, that comes to the public from
                    critics of education as now administered and acquired, the burden of <pb n="407" id="VAA4025-035-4-045"/> which is that it is through the multitude of extra-curricular
                    activities that students, turned out as graduates, are mainly equipped for life, while most of such
                    equipment is bad or at best worthless.</p>
            <p>On the whole, teachers do not receive much encouragement from the evaluation of their work, and those
                    who ponder all the questions that are raised about the effectiveness of their efforts often fell
                    like accepting as a verdict—"Weighed in the balance and found wanting."
                    I only wish to add that I do not think it is so bad as all that. If, in the midst of all the
                    complications and distractions that hamper the task of teaching, including most of the devices
                    offered to help and which are too frantically seized and applied, teachers can hold faithfully to
                    certain simple, fundamental and well-established principles, there is still some hope. The teacher
                    who believes that it is important to show his students the true value of acquiring knowledge and
                    acquiring it accurately, before expressing convictions or deciding on courses of action, cannot
                    fail. This will make for straight thinking—something that the world has always needed,
                    and which is now needed as never before, it seems. Then, too, there is a saving thought in this,
                    that no high school or college course should be considered as more than a beginning. It gives the
                    students something on which to build and points of departure from which to go forward. The teacher
                    who encourages straight thinking and starts his students on periods of growth that will last through
                    life is a success.</p>

                    in business. The junior member of the firm continued the business for many years after Colonel

                                    humble worshiper at the Muse's lighted shrine", I have a
                                    passionate love for poetry, however little claim it may have to that appellation.
                                    There is a charm a spell, a something talismanic, in the jugling together of
                                    beautiful words, when fraught with sweet sentiment, into beautiful (if I may use the
                                    term) sounds, which never fails to win me from my self, once this dull dozy, prosy
                                    sorry day sort of a world and carry me on "fancy's
                                    pinions", "Far beyond the bounds of visible and vulgar
                                    things." To use the exquisitely beautiful words of Bulwar, what is more
                                    delightful than to "Soar on the wild wings<hi rend="sup">!</hi> of thought
                                    above the "smoke and stir" of this dim
                                    earth".—"What a glad awakening from
                                    self,—what a sparkling and fresh draught from a new source of
                                    being." And what is so capable of inspiring these feelings as <hi rend="i">poetry?</hi> They are <hi rend="i">poetry</hi> in their primitive
                                    state;—but when embodied in poetic words, they are <hi rend="i">more</hi>. But I forget that I am talking to Alexander—not Daniel.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> I will not, however, leave the subject until I insist upon the

                                    Gardiners has, however, conversed every day with Some of the Indians upon the

                                    </placeName> Horne arrived here last evening, just at sunset. <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                                    </placeName> Horne, on seeing a letter from his father to me, determined on setting
                                    out for Piqua this morning after breakfast, <hi rend="i">which he did</hi>, He told
                                    me he had not solicited any situation from Lane; but <hi rend="i">this I do not
                                        believe</hi>, as just as he was starting, he told Lane, on taking leave, he
                                    should "like very much to go with him," and Lane replied,
                                    "O yes, we shall see each other a good deal this summer." In plain
                                    English, I suspect Billy for a little meanness, if not <hi rend="i">slander</hi> and
                                        <hi rend="i">treachery</hi>. One thing is certain, <hi rend="i">some one</hi>
                                    has been poisoning the mind of Lane against me, by some slander, or by making him
                                    believe I wanted to govern him in his appointments. He had a long conversation with
                                    Vance yesterday, and he and <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                                    </placeName> Horne called at Vance's house, two miles this side of <placeName>

                                    self-sufficient, and insufficiently dandified. At <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> he was <hi rend="i">humble</hi>, and in the posture of a <hi rend="i">supplicant</hi>. He asked many favours of me, <hi rend="i">to get him an
                                    office</hi>. I barely hinted to him to-day, in riding out to the Reservation, that

                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                                    </placeName> Horne would both like to go with us, and were capable, &amp;c. He
                                    said nothing <hi rend="i">then</hi>—but sometime afterwards, observed
                                    that he intended to "manage his affairs altogether according to <hi rend="i">his own judgment</hi>, without advice from any one." In
                                    speaking of his Secretary, he said he had "one in his eye." In
                                    talking of commissa;ies, he said he had "two or three in his eye."
                                    I begin to despise this little kind of meanness and want of candor; and I anticipate
                                    no cordiality or satisfaction in the association of <hi rend="i">Lieut. Lane</hi>. I
                                    shall keep him <hi rend="i">in his own place</hi>, and will not <hi rend="i">openly</hi> break with him, if I can well avoid it. I do not want you to come up
                                    here, until you hear from me by next mail. I shall not <hi rend="i">ask</hi> for any
                                    thing for you. It may be that Lane means you, among those he has "got in
                                    his eye"; but I think one is <placeName>

                        <p>When I wrote you last I was in a great hurry and had scarcely time enough to put into
                                    the <hi rend="i">crowded sheet</hi>, and <hi rend="i">lengthy epistle</hi>, more
                                    than one half of the <hi rend="i">ideas</hi> which I had previously intended; now
                                    the whole family are "stowed" <hi rend="i">snugly in their nightly
                                        lairs</hi>, and I have naught to interrupt me save the barking of dogs and the
                                    occasional bite of a stragling musketo. I shall endeavour to write <hi rend="i">something</hi> which interests you and myself.</p>
                        <p>Today Col. McPherson, Col. Gardiner, Lieut. Lane &amp; Dan. Dun.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> rode from this place to the [house of the chief of] the Indian Reservation,
                                    probably five miles from here (the I. Res. is within a much shorter distance) and
                                    while at the house of the principal Chief of the Nation, we understood from him and
                                    some of the Warriors who had assembled there, that <hi rend="i">they had fully
                                        determined not to go by water</hi>, which, I think will entirely "knock
                                    your hopes in the head"—and for this reason, all the officers
                                    which the W. Dept. has allowed the Supt. to have, <hi rend="i">are
                                        engaged,' and not a vacancy now
                                        remains</hi>.—(Guy's<hi rend="sup">15</hi> only excepted,
                                    which he is doubtless ready and waiting for its confirmation to accept.)</p>
                        <p>If there was any other situation within the reach of uncle's<hi rend="sup">16</hi> popularity, which it would be agreeable for you to have, he would
                                    doubtless procure it for you; but I see none—and if there is such a <hi rend="i">place he has kept it in the dark</hi> (from me.) But I have some reason
                                    to think, that, if McLane's letter to you from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>

                                    forsake the "long cherished land of your nativity,"<hi rend="sup">17</hi> for the more wild, but not less <hi rend="i">subtancial</hi> one of

                                    for I have, from circumstances, which are, however, well known to yourself, been an

                        <p>Your Uncle Guy arrived here last Monday, &amp; you may be assured that I was
                                    heartily glad to see him. One whom I have always been taught to esteem as worthy and
                                    honorable was welcomed with the most sincere pleasure. His appearance and manner are
                                    not entirely such as I had anticipated, but the former is not uninteresting; and I
                                    suppose the latter will be much better liked (if it is possible) upon a further
                                    acquaintance.—his conversation is pleasing and his mind appears well
                                    stocked with intelligence and useful acquirements. I am much pleased that he will
                                    accompany us—It would be much better if <list type="footnotes">

                                    appears that that is out of the question.</p>
                        <p>By the last mail I wrote to Uncle James<hi rend="sup">20</hi> a letter containing two
                                    closely written sheets of fools-cap; one, of <hi rend="i">minutia</hi> about the
                                    affairs of the Lewistown, Wapaghkonetta,<hi rend="sup">21</hi> and Ottowa
                                    Indians,—reports from them,—issuing rations, vaccinating
                                    &amp;c. and the other upon the subject of <hi rend="i">gentlemen's
                                        characters</hi>—a delicate thing you know—but I talked of
                                    the persons in as delicate a manner as I thought consistent with my situation, good
                                    manners and duty to J. B. &amp;c. &amp;cand myself.</p>
                        <p>The Col. (our uncle)<hi rend="sup">22</hi> has not yet received the expected and
                                    anxiously wished for communication from the Presdt. or Secty. of War.</p>
                        <p>We have no idea yet how long it will be before we are enabled to commence on our
                                    journey. There was a letter from the merchant at Sandusky City to whom the Rifles,
                                    Sheeting, and blankets were consigned, directed to Gardiner,<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                                    Stating that those articles had been received—they will probably be here
                                    in ten days or two weeks, after which time it will require two weeks to prepare for
                                    the trip.—So if Gardiner's com. is favourable, and is received
                                    Soon, we may get away in three or four weeks. I am very impatient to go—I
                                    am positively sick of so much delay and idleness; and was it not for the pay, which
                                    God knows I need bad enough, I would Steer some other course without the hesitation
                                    of a moment.—<hi rend="i">"Time is a great physician"
                                        and experience a great teacher</hi>. According to the old saying <hi rend="i">"it will make no great difference a thousand years
                                    hence"</hi> if we are compelled to undergo hardships, and experience some
                                    difficulties and uneasiness now.</p>
                        <p>I shall write to Father &amp; mother in a day or two, and let them know that I am
                                    in the land of the living—I have not written to them Since in the first
                                    ten days I was at the "Wigwam."</p>
                        <p>Guy<hi rend="sup">24</hi> has told me that if there should a vacancy occur, he would
                                    secure it for you—it is not probable that <hi rend="i">any will
                                    occur</hi>. It is thought that not more than half a dozen families of the Ottowas
                                    will remove—if so I expect or Gardiner hinted, they [Ottowas] will <hi rend="i">need no Conductor</hi>, Ast. Conductor &amp;c. but will be attached
                                    to one of these two tribes. It is true that there is a probability of Judge Shelby
                                    resigning his office as Ast. Con. to Robb, as he thinks he will be unable. through
                                    sickness, to accompany the Indians, but the preference, <hi rend="i">for the Sake of
                                        economy</hi>, will doubtless, be given to the Condr. or Asst. Condr. of the
                                    Ottowas, who will <hi rend="i">draw pay until</hi> the Agt. &amp; Superdt. con.
                                    have it stopt by writing to the War Dept. that the Ottowas will not remove! ! ! !
                                    (or for other and better reasons)—your idea of this matter must lead you
                                    into the proper channel, you know who are dealing in this business and what their
                                    sentiments are—if a place could be procured, which you would accept, by
                                    Gardiner, or Pool, you would get it.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Aleck,</salute>
                        <p>I am yet at Col. McPherson's waiting the movements of my superiors in
                                    office.</p>
                        <p>Col. J. B. G. arrived here about a week ago and went into Wapagh-konetta (30 miles)
                                    to put things in order there, and facilitate the preparations of those Indians for
                                    their departure; he returned and said all was in a rapid state of forwardness there;
                                    he then gave orders to Col. Mc and myself to assemble the Lewistown Indians (our
                                    band) who are in this vicinity, on the 12th and be prepared to bid adeau to Logan
                                    County on Sunday next. Col. McElvain was to pay the Indians the money for their
                                    improvements ($19,000.) He arrived here last Friday and proceeded to
                                    Wapagh to pay those people first—that caused Gardiner, who was ordered to
                                    be present and give directions how the money should be paid, to go to that place
                                    without delay—which he done on Sunday last. He will return to-morrow, I
                                    expect, which is the day that we are ordered to have the Indians encamped. Nearly
                                    everything is now ready for a <hi rend="i">move.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                           </hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Guy left here for the Maumee about a week ago, and is expected back in a day or two.
                                    He went to hurry Hollister and his tawney brethren, the Ottowas, some of whom are
                                    now encamped at Wapagh-konetta.</p>
                        <p>Col. VanHorne was here on Sunday last to endeavor to procure a situation for Wm. in
                                    the emigrating expedition. There probably never was any body more anxious to
                                    accompany the emigrants than this same Wm. V H. and I would have not the least
                                    objection to his company—He does not please you very well I
                                    know—neither is his dis <list type="footnotes">

                                    Lieu't. Lane has orders to furnish provisions for my red brethren at the
                                    latter place on the 20th of this mo. The Lieut's Commissaries and Asst.
                                    Coms. have been turned adrift by the War Departmen—he has retained four
                                    of them however under a different cognomen—calling three <hi rend="i">Disbursing Agents</hi>, being one to each detachment of Indians; and the other
                                    his brother of 16 <hi rend="i">Disbursing Asst's Clerk</hi>—They

                        <p>Col. Mc. and myself agree to-gether very well. Nobody under the sun could have his
                                    confidence for one day, even after an acquaintance of a twelvemonth, who would not
                                    humor him. He is as changeable as the wind, and yet must always have his own way, if
                                    consulted, upon matters which concern him, previously to their accomplishment;
                                    therefore if I want anything done I must humor him as much as possible, and do what
                                    I want done without saying a word until it is finished—if then he is in
                                    an agreeable mood, he will sanction it: if not, it is otherwise. I shall have all
                                    the writing to do; both his and mine of every description—dcs [accounts]

                        <salute>Dear brother,</salute>
                        <p>I have been here for three days, with the formost detachment of Indians, waiting the
                                    orders of Col. J. B. Gardiner, who is now at Hardin, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> about sixty miles N. E. of here. His last directions to the Condr. were
                                    to remain in this neighborhood until further orders should arrive from him, on the
                                    subject of our route. Gen. Wockman, the son-in-law of Col. McPherson the Condr. is
                                    now acting in <hi rend="i">that</hi> capacity. The Col's wife died a few
                                    days ago and he could not leave home until he settled his business. I am glad of the
                                    change and hope it may continue to the end of our journey, but there is but little
                                    hope of it.—Gen. W. has so far acted like a gentleman to me; but
                                    notwithstanding what I said in my letters of Col. Mc<hi rend="sup">31</hi> he has
                                    treated me (as I conceive) basely, unmannerly, ungentlemanly, &amp;c. and it is
                                    not certain how long he will remain as Condr. for the Spl. Agt. is not much better
                                    pleased with him than myself.</p>
                        <p>It is about 10 days since we left Bellefontaine; we shall move from here I think in a

                                    accompany this party.</p>
                        <p>Our camp exhibits quite a martial appearance—we have 258 persons
                                    —there is about 50 tents. Guns, tomahawks, Scalping knives &amp;c.
                                    are profusely scattered about the tents and fires at the camping ground. We are not
                                    much plagued with drunken Indians—but we are often a little discommoded
                                    by the great number of white persons who come from all quarters to see our tawney
                                    brethren.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday I wrote to Coz. Harriet from whom I received a letter a few days ago (as
                                    well as from Lucy), written in the most affectionate style. They both (the girls)
                                    and Caroline also speak of you with the utmost affection: if you were their brother
                                    they could not praise your virtuous qualities higher than they do. Whenever my
                                    thoughts revert to those girls, which is not very seldom, I feel a kind of pleasant,
                                    a joyful sensation pervade me which could only be created by the conception that
                                    they are meritorous and highly deserving my esteem.</p>
                        <p>I wrote to our parents a few days before I left Logan Co. O. to inform them that I
                                    was yet in the land of mcrtals; and I would thank you to write by the first
                                    opportunity after recelving this and tell them where I am; also tell them to direct
                                    to me at Terre-Haute Ind. immediately, <list type="footnotes">

                        <salute>Dear Bother,</salute>
                        <p>Col. Gardiner joined us at indianapolis on the 6th or 7th inst. We moved onthe next
                                    day towards this place, which is 56 miles W. of the metropolis. He has not been to
                                    the Wig since he left there 6 weeks ago; and does not intend going(nor guy neither)
                                    until he returns from the "far west." Wm. V H. has been with him
                                    as clerk since he started. He however complains that Wm does not please him, and
                                    has, after several solicitations, at last prevailed upon me to exchange situations
                                    with him for a <hi rend="i">few days at least.</hi> He says the pay shall be the
                                    same; but that I do not so much think about (but probably I should) as the disorder
                                    in which I may find the duties of Asst. Condr. in this detachment when I again
                                    resume that station—I fear I shall have trouble, but my trust is placed
                                    in him "who is able to save."</p>
                        <p>We have got <hi rend="i">So far without meeting with any reformed,</hi> and one or
                                    two pretty good scoldings. But now, since I will be immediately under his eye, I
                                    hope that I will be so instructed by him that I will purse the <hi rend="i">Straight-forward-corse-of-retitude</hi> without needing the <hi rend="i">stimulating influence</hi> of No. 6 or a "Reformation."</p>
                        <p>W. VH. appears not so well pleased with this business as he anticipated before he
                                    joined us-he says that he would about as soon return as to proced if he could
                                    procure some money; but the Disbursing Agent Says that his funds are now about to be
                                    exhausted, and if he does not receive a new supply in a very few days <hi rend="i">"all operatins must cease,"</hi> (which will be had indeed)
                                    by which you see his prospects for getting money are nt very
                                    flattering—he will therefore continue. he has said but a few words about
                                    A. H. D.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> since he came out the last time, which has somewhat
                                    surprised me, as he was before continually speaking of Alexander— all was

                        <p>We are getting along bravely. Lt. Lane<hi rend="sup">38</hi> is in some other

                                    </placeName> to procure more. We have been supporting ourselves and the Indians,
                                    nearly all the time since we left Indiana, upon <hi rend="i">money borrowed from the
                                        Indians.! !</hi> What do you thing of this kind of business? Does it not seem to
                                    be squally times with us— we are however, in better spirits than you
                                    could possibly imagine we were while destitue of money—our tavern bills
                                    are immoderately, extra vagently high. We have for two weeks had extremely fine
                                    weather, with the exception of two or three days. Oh how delightful has been several
                                    prospects–and indeed nearly all, through the <placeName>

                                    some of the scenery of this wilderness of <hi rend="i">fertility,</hi> I will do
                                    so— probably that will not be until I return.</p>
                        <p>I had the pleasure of meeting with Dr. Gideon Baily in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Cole Co. in this state. He has commenced practicing in that
                                    place–it (the village) exhibits but a dull prospect, but there is some
                                    valuable–or at least very fertile land aroung it. He has been there but a
                                    few weeks. He says he gets about as much practice as any physician in the county. He
                                    also talks of engaging in the mercantile business with a young man of that village.
                                    I advised his to settle in some village on the National Road.</p>
                        <p>I have had the pleasure of conversing with Capt. Hall— the brother-in-law
                                    of Maj. Long who went to explore the Rocky mountain country–he is quite
                                    an intelligent man. I aslo saw his brother James Hall the editor of the <placeName>

                                    much regretted by her young acquaintances–and particulary by our worthy

                        <p>I will now stop until the mail arrives–and then close this. I have written
                                    in such haste and with so little care that it will be difficult for you to unravel
                                    the substance of this epistle.</p>
                        <p>It is now getting dark.– I have waited an hour since writing the above,
                                    and the mail has not yet arrived. Col. Gardiner has gone to the encampment, 6 miles
                                    off. I will wait for the stage if it comes not before midnight; and then go to the
                                    camp. I have a travelling companion, waiting on the same business, to cheer, or

                        <salute>Dear brother.</salute>
                        <p>I have just arrived from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to which place I went this morning for the purpose of purchasing such
                                    articles as I (these cold nights) find necessary to the comfort of a <hi rend="i">tent.</hi> While at that place I enquired for letters, and had the satisfaction
                                    of finding one from yourself and one from friend Thompson.</p>
                        <p>At Hickory Grove, 28 miles W. of Vandalia, Co. John J. Albert of the U. S. Army,
                                    arrived on the 25th inst. to settle the dispute between were(or, at least, the Col.
                                    was) unwilling to do so. A thatn assumed the direction of the emigration and gave

                                    </placeName> and report from thence to the War Department for <hi rend="i">further
                                        order!</hi> He ordered Lt. L. to proceed to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and from thence to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington City</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to settle up his accounts, and report for order! ! He requested Uncle
                                    James to accompany him to the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                                    </placeName> before he returned, which proposition the Col. has acceded to.</p>
                        <p>The poweer bestowed upon Co. Abert by the War Department were sufficient to warrant
                                    him in the course which he has pursued. Col. J. B. G. expresses the greatest
                                    pleasure in the decision of Col. Abert. He can now return to his family, which he is
                                    anxious to see, and provide for their safety in these critical moments, without the
                                    least disgrace whatever from any act during the <hi rend="i">expedition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The tribe which I am with goes to a different place from the rest of the Indians now
                                    emigrating from <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>, and we separated from the main body three days ago. We shall cross the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> at St. Genevieve, 40 miles S. of here; and the others will cross it
                                    about 20 miles above <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, at Alton. We all avoid <placeName>

                                    </placeName> to keep out of the way of the Cholera, which, a few days ago, made a
                                    rapid advance towards depopulating the city. About one third of the inhabitants have
                                    left the place, and a large number have gone to the other world, but I was told this
                                    morning while there that there was <hi rend="i">no Case in town;</hi> we may judge
                                    that the epidemic is abating. I am sorry to hear that it is in <placeName>

                        <p>I left my red brethren yesterday 13 miles N. of here, and expected to meet them by
                                    noon at this village; but it is now 3 oc. and I have been here half an hour but they
                                    have not passed nor have a heard of them. I fear some accident has happened, and I
                                    must go and see.</p>
                        <p>Uncle Guy has accompanied the other party—and will probably continue with
                                    it. If uncle J. B. G. had not got off on such good terms Guy, myself and serveral
                                    others would most likely have resigned; but as <hi rend="i">it is</hi>we, I expect,

                        <p>It has been a long time since I wrote to you, but I have endeavored to keep up a
                                    correspondence with Alexander, by which means you would be apprised of my various
                                    situations and the state of things generally in relation to your son Dan. I wrote to
                                    him from the other side of the river two or threee days ago.</p>
                        <p>This day we succeeded in landing all the Indians in this detachment on the Western
                                    Side of the "Father of water.' We have occupied the greater part

                        <p>My time is very much occupied. I have generally had remarkably good health. It
                                    appears that this kind of living—sleeping in a tent before a

                                    or 4 Oc.—agrees very well with me. I rode for a few days with Uncle

            <p>Dr. Loehr's 33-page preface to the <hi rend="i">Diaries</hi> contains, first of all,
                    biographical sketches of the two diarists, whose journals are so unusual for the very reason that
                    farmers are usually too tired after doing the evening chores to record their experiences. William R.
                    Brown was born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Urbana</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, in 1816, and, in 1841, he moved into the region around
                    Red Rock, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, married, and took up a claim of one square mile. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> prospered during the eighteen-fifties, and, on the eve of the panic of 1857, was
                    assertedly worth $50,000. Mitchell Y. Jackson, the other diarist, was born in the same
                    year and likewise came from the Buckeye state. Jackson, however, spent his boyhood days in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Then, in 1854, he moved out on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> frontier to a place near Lake Ct. Croix, where, with his family, he lived for seventeen
                    years.</p>

                    frontier communities, although by mid-century it experienced a mushroom growth. It is about the
                    simple everyday life—its joys, its sorrows, and its hardships—that these two
                    diaries tell.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest to the students of Indiana history is Jackson's diary, especially the

            <p>It is in view of the dearth of this type of material, namely diaries by dirt farmers, that the

            <p>The author's purpose in this book has been to present "a panoramic view of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the portals of the Old Fauntleroy Home." Very fittingly does this
                    historic Home serve as a point of departure for such an endeavor. The Fauntleroy Home was built by
                    the followers of George Rapp, occupied by a typical Rappite family, and when those industrious
                    people moved away, it was used as a dwelling by members of the Owen community. Finally, it came into
                    the possession of Robert Henry Fauntleroy and his wife, Jane Dale Owen. Ever since, except for brief
                    intervals, Fauntleroys or Owens have occupied it. In its more than a century of existence, its walls
                    have witnessed the comings and goings of cultured and educated people, who have given to <placeName>

                    birthplace of the Minerva Club, a pioneer woman's club in Indiana, and it was the home of
                    scientists, authors and statesmen.</p>
            <p>Since the home was built by the Rappites, the first chapter of the book is quite properly devoted to
                    an account of the Rappites and their communal life. Succeeding chapters tell the story of the
                    efforts of Robert Owen to establish a "New Moral World"; the doings of those who
                    came with him; the coming together of the Owen and Fauntleroy families; the founding of the Minerva
                    Club; the lives of its members; the programs of the club; and finally, an appreciation of the work
                    of Miss Mary Emily Fauntleroy in preserving the home as a shrine for the women of Indiana.</p>

            <p>Really, the book is a popular account of the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the story is told in an appreciative manner. The romance and charm of the town and
                    its inhabitants are given special emphasis, and much use is made of the contemporary writings of
                    those who lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or visited there. It is not critical history writing, but it was not intended to be
                    such, and errors and mistakes that appear are due to the inadequate research which has been made
                    into the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and especially in reference to the lives of the children of Robert Owen. The author
                    has made use of the best secondary sources available at present, and since he frankly attempted to
                    give only a "panoramic" view of the subject, he should not be held too closely to
                    details.</p>
            <p>The author has succeeded admirably in his task of providing a guide to the main events of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> history, and the reader should receive an insight into the undoubted sterling qualities
                    of those men and women who came and went into the Old Fauntleroy Home. The book itself is a pleasure
                    to handle and read. It is beautifully bound in dark blue simulated leather, with an embossed
                    representation of the Golden Rain Tree on the cover. Inside cover maps, photographs, and exquisite
                    line drawings are aids to the reader in visualizing the places and scenes of the story. An adequate
                    index is of great assistance in following the rather complicated genealogy of the Fauntleroy and
                    Owen families. Finally, the thanks of all who want to know more about <placeName>

                    were, with plateau belts to the east, south and west, and, beyond these, lowlands along the

            <p>For a number of years, I have been interested in the mountain area of the South and have been trying
                    to get acquainted with this fascinating region through personal journeys. The ridges, the water-gaps
                    and wind-gaps, the rivers, the roads, the agricultural lands of the Appalachian Valley, the mountain
                    people, the cities—all these have a fascination for me that cause me to want to go again
                    and again to this wonderful mountain country that is so near to Indiana. There are winter resorts
                    and summer resorts with fine hotels and golf courses, to and from which people come and go every
                    year, but I am not personally attracted by these features of the southern highlands. In the natural
                    beauty, in the complex drainage system, and in the lines marked out by nature to be followed by
                    individuals and families as they migrated to new lands to play a part in their colonization, I have
                    a perennial interest.</p>

            <p>The passes of the southern mountains, both water-gaps and wind-gaps, have played an important part in
                    American history. Early explorers, traders and colonists used these passes. Builders of railroads
                    and highways have through the years sought them out. In the case of wind-gaps, railroads frequently
                    tunnel under, though not highways. The best known mountain pass east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

                    </placeName>. Roads converge on this high pass from the Appalachian Valley, some from the northeast
                    and some from the southwest, while others come from the Piedmont and Tidewater belts east of the
                    Great Smokies and Blue Ridge.</p>
            <p>The water gaps through the Blue Ridge, cut by the Potomac, the James and the <placeName>

                    influenced colonization, trade and travel.</p>
            <p>One of the most interesting passes in the Southern appalachians is that where the <geogName>New

            <p>The beautiful gap through the Great Smokies that is occupied by the French Broad is easy of access to
                    travelers, as it is followed by an important line of the Southern Railway system and also by a
                    federal highway. Because of the popularity of the vast Smoky Mountains Park, thousands of tourists
                    pass through the gorge of the French Broad every year. Not only the passes of the greater mountains
                    of the South are of interest, but the wind-gaps and water-gaps of lesser mountain ridges, are of
                    real consequence to the people who live in the Southern Appalachians or travel through Southern
                    Appalachia. Massanutten Mountain, North Mountain, Shenandoah Mountain, Clinch Mountain, Chilhowie
                    Mountain, and others that lie wholly within the Appalachian Valley, are real barriers to movement,
                    and road builders from the beginning have had to hunt for the best places to go over or through
                    them. The same is true of ridges in foothill areas.</p>
            <p>The influence of passes in directing trade is evidenced by the location of the cities and towns of
                    mountain areas. In the Southern Appalachians, one readily thinks of Cumberland, in

            <p>The drainage system of the Southern Appalachians is as striking in its complexity as that of any part
                    of the world. In fact, <hi rend="i">system</hi> is a misnomer. The Potomac, James and <placeName>

                    drains a small part of the Alleghany Plateau, and breaks through the Alleghany Escarpment before
                    reaching the Appalachian Valley where it is joined by the South Branch. The <geogName>James
                    River</geogName> has its source on the Alleghany Front and drains a considerable part of the
                    Appalachian Valley as it flows towards the Blue Ridge. The <placeName>
