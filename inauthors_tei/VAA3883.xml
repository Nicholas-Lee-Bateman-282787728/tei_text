                <head>THE WIFE OF MAROBIUS<lb/> BY<lb/> MAX EHRMANN</head>
                <p>The Wife of Marobius is strongly dramatic and<lb/> beautifully simple.--<hi
                        rend="b">New York Evening Mail.</hi></p>
                <p>Not often is the secret of a woman&apos;s emotional na-<lb/>ture revealed as
                    clearly as in this drama of love and<lb/> passion.--<hi rend="b">Pittsburg
                        Press.</hi></p>
                <p>This story is true to-day and forever.--<hi rend="b">Seattle<lb/>Times.</hi></p>
                <p>Max Ehrmann reveals the rich quality of his genius in The Wife of Marobius.--<hi
                        rend="b">Milwaukee Wis-<lb/>consin.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a bold theme. Emotion rises to the in-<lb/>tensest pitch, but the poet
                    rises with it, and no false<lb/> note is struck. . . . . Ehrmann has produced
                    a<lb/>notable piece of literature.--<hi rend="b">Indianapolis News.</hi></p>
                <p>A moving and poignant tragedy, a play that is at<lb/>once poetic and
                        dramatic.--<hi rend="b">Chicago Evening News.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>It is intense and exalted; a play of palpitant power,<lb/>in which barbaric
                    passion breathes through verse<lb/>of splendid texture.--<hi rend="b">Pittsburg
                        Gazette Times.</hi></p>
                <p>It is a study of sensuous beauty, warm with life<lb/>and movement, and with a
                    genuine feeling for the<lb/>tears of things expressed in music woven out
                    of<lb/>shadow and the reverses of the spirit. It has beauty<lb/>and life--<hi
                        rend="b">Boston Transcript.</hi></p>
                <p>In The Wife of Marobius this gifted author displays<lb/>his genius in a new and
                    brilliant light. There is in<lb/>the play a dignity of style, a notable
                    eloquence of<lb/>expression, and a dramatic intensity that are
                    tremen-<lb/>dously compelling.--<hi rend="b">Buffalo Courier.</hi></p>
                <p>It is marked with passion and intensity; and is<lb/>powerfully dramatic.--<hi
                        rend="b">San Franciso Bulletin.</hi></p>
                <p>How I should love to play it! Really it is full of<lb/>great, great chances.--<hi
                        rend="b">William Faversham.</hi></p>
                <p>Here are a fine and sure sense of technique, a<lb/>subtle understanding of the
                    feminine mind, and a<lb/>noble feeling for beauty at once sensuous and
                        moral.<lb/>--<hi rend="b">The Drama.</hi></p>

                        room stands a marble pillar from which project two candlesticks of seven
                        arches. At back there is a window screened by bronze shutters, be- neath and

                        and onyx. Against part of the back wall hangs gold woven tapestry. A citrus
                        table stands in the centre of the room; and a couch at right. There is a
                        door at left and a door at right. On the wall near the door at left is
                        attached a cluster of Greek and Barbarian weapons, daggers, spears, and
                        swords. From the ceiling hangs a small bell of hammered gold. The
