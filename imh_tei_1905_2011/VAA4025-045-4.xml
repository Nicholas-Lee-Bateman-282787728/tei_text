            <p>Sixteen years ago Arthur M. Schlesinger in his study of the rise of the city called attention to the
                    absence of "adequate social histories of particular cities," inferring that an
                    evaluation of the historical role of the city as a socializing influence must await a time when
                    these should appear.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> It is the purpose of this paper to trace the impact of the
                    urbanization process upon one such particular city, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Prime objects of consideration are changes in the relation of city and surrounding
                    countryside, alterations in the city's social structure, and the development of cultural
                    maturity. The chronological limits are 1865 and 1914, since in between lies the period crucial to
                    the transformation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> from town to city.</p>
            <p>Underlying the pattern of discussion are three questions of general importance for the urbanization
                    movement as a whole. First, does the course of urban change in smaller cities conform to the larger
                    national pattern? Second, does this change reflect an independent or a satellite role in the
                    development of such lesser centers? Finally, was the basic relationship of industrial city and
                    agrarian state one of friendliness or of hostility?</p>

                    politics, not of economic forces. In 1821 the legislature had designated an unsettled location in
                    the center of the state as the site of the future capital and dubbed it "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Since the spot was far removed from any break in transportation, the town
                    which clustered around the state house lacked an economic basis for existence until the coming of
                    the railroads in 1847. The Civil War, however, converted <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> into a thriving commercial center, consumed with ambitious dreams of following in the
                    footsteps of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By 1914 it had reached metropolitan status and boasted a quarter of a million
                    inhabitants.</p>
            <p>This rapid growth was the product not of steady increase but of waves of intense activity followed by
                    periods of relative stagnancy. The first wave or boom occurred between 1860 and 1873 when the city,
                    profiting by pork packing and the railroad net which it had lately subsidized at great cost to the
                    municipal credit, threw off the commercial shackles of "the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> blood-suckers" and tripled its population.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The panic of
                    1873, however, struck the speculation-crazed city a blow from which it did not recover for fifteen
                    years.</p>
            <p>Despite the depression of 1893–1896 the second and greatest surge of business activity and
                    growth occurred between 1888 and 1900, resulting from the development of the north central Indiana
                    natural gas fields. When the failure of the gas supply became obvious after 1900 and local
                    industries were compelled to convert to Indiana soft coal, an inevitable decline occurred, eased but
                    not halted by the development of a great <placeName>

            <p>As country trading town shaded into industrial city, the character and composition of the population
                    altered accordingly. The so-called "native stock" in 1860 drew heavily from
                    southern origins, but after the Civil War it shifted its sources to the east and north. By 1900 the
                    "Kentuckians," once the dominant group, were being referred to as a small and
                    undesirable element by the new "native stock" whose forebears came from <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> or the Middle Atlantic states.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unlike the cities of the Eastern seaboard, where city growth preceded the coming of the
                    "new" immigration, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> the Germans and the Irish began arriving well before the Civil War put an end to the
                    city's stagnancy. In the trading town of 1860, the foreign born were at least twenty per
                    cent of the total population; by 1910 they totaled less than nine per cent.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    This somewhat surprising trend should not be allowed to obscure the extremely important role played
                    in the city's development by the Germans and Irish in particular, and the French, Jews, and
                    Scandinavians to a lesser degree. The Germans, culturally the most advanced, dominated the musical
                    life of the city while providing a heavy percentage of workers in the skilled trades and
                    professions. The Irish, at first restricted to the role of common laborers, steadily worked their
                    way upward in business and politics; today the city's mayor and its most spectacular
                    entrepreneur can trace their origins back to the Irish community which centered on the
                    "South Side."</p>
            <p>The declining percentage of foreign born is best explained by the failure of the southern and eastern
                    European peoples to present themselves in large numbers. Although nationally they far exceeded all
                    other incoming groups after 1900, Slavic and Italian immigrants were never numerous in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Even by 1940 the principal foreign element was still the Germans, outnumbering the
                    largest Slavic group nearly four to one.</p>

            <p>The urban impact remorselessly shattered the old market town way of life, revised its institutions
                    and replaced its culture. As Booth Tarkington put it, "That small city, the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Certainly it swept away the old local government. From 1860 to 1890 the city vainly attempted to
                    adapt a system of town government based upon a minimum of expense, personnel and services to a
                    population numbering high in the tens of thousands. But what had worked well enough in a small
                    community where officials were known to all and individual efforts did no great injury to neighbors,
                    now led to an orgy of corruption and irresponsibility. In 1890 the same business leaders who had
                    ushered in the new era of natural gas revolted against the paralyzing presence of the decrepit city
                    government. Through the medium of the Commercial Club, specially organized for the purpose, a new
                    city charter was prepared and adopted which expanded the powers of government many-fold and
                    completely reordered its structure. The result was a golden age in which a powerful mayor working
                    through newly created executive boards paved the streets, forced the electrification of public
                    lighting and transportation, modernized police and fire departments, created an effective park and
                    playground system, elevated grade crossings, and made a serious beginning at sanitation and slum
                    clearance.</p>

                    which had proved so successful in the economic sphere were now being extended to the political. In
                    the final analysis municipal corporations did not seem greatly different from business corporations.
                    Government was regarded more and more as a mere matter of management; fifteen years later that same
                    Commercial Club sponsored an investigation of city manager government, approved it, and ultimately
                    secured a city manager law. There were, of course, complicating features. As city expenditures rose
                    from $80,172 in 1860 to $5,869,400 in 1908, increasing seventy fold while the
                    population grew only thirteen fold, the agencies wielding this huge power began to create as well as
                    execute policy, to the dismay of many erstwhile "reformers."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>The urban impact upon the surrounding agricultural community was no less devastating. Only by the

                    </placeName>. Thereafter the county assumed a critical and mildly superior air toward the city, an
                    attitude sustained by the tendency of town officials to pass responsibility to parallel county
                    agencies and by such practices as the rental of the courthouse basement for city offices.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Meanwhile the city was subtly undermining agricultural independence. In 1870

                    dairying and truck garden products had completely replaced them. Farms had become smaller, more
                    numerous and more valuable, tenancy was on the increase, but the value of all farm production now
                    surpassed that of any other county. Significantly, papers given by <placeName>

                    </placeName> the basic social institutions were receiving a thorough revamping. The family,
                    declining in size and steadily loosing its traditional social functions, gave serious alarm to
                    churchmen of all faiths who pointed accusingly at the factories and commercialized amusements seldom
                    found in the old agrarian town. Less vocal elements, however, probably sympathized in secret with
                    May Wright Sewall when she averred publicly that "overproduction in a family" was

            <p>The same pattern of religious change which was unfolding all over urban America appeared in the
                    Hoosier capital, but hesitantly and incompletely. In 1890, Protestant denominations were alarmed to
                    find Roman Catholicism outnumbering any single one of them; yet Protestant churches continued their
                    steady withdrawal toward the suburbs, begun twenty years earlier. Large and successful revivals in
                    the 1870's and 1880's proved only that the religious interest of pre-war town
                    living died hard, for by the 1890's formerly successful evangelists completely failed to
                    attract crowds. Church membership totals remained high, although some observers pointed out that
                    eighty per cent of the average 1900 congregation were women.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> More and more the
                    churches abandoned an active role in the political arena, retreating to the safety of non-political
                    charity and social work carried on in the rapidly growing slums of the poorer quarters.</p>
            <p>Though the church might denounce the trend, as it did, commercialized amusements and sports steadily
                    crowded out home and family as centers of recreational activity. The Sunday School decayed beneath
                    the competition of the Sunday newspaper; baseball drew both godly and ungodly from churches and
                    homes. In the commercial town of the 1860's the theater, exhibitions of various sorts, and
                    outdoor participant sports had delighted young and old; thirty years later all had yielded ground to
                    the inroads of spectator sports, semipublic dances, billiards and pool. After 1900 the mechanization
                    of amusements introduced a third phase in city recreation as crowds thronged to dime movies and
                    watched the various assorted machines in which men now raced with one another.</p>

            <p>The structure of social classes likewise took new shape in urban air. Labor began to grow and assert
                    itself as industry increased. Less obvious, but equally far-reaching was the shift of the upper
                    class from an economic base of landed property to one of cash and paper, and loud were the moans of
                    the older genteel aristocracy as the nouveaux riches elbowed their way to the apex of the social
                    structure. With ever larger hordes of human beings thronging the city acres, wealthy and poor began
                    to live more separate lives. By the end of the century young Hoosier aristocrats found an Ivy League
                    college education topped off by a European tour a social necessity.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                    leadership a nominally free public school system had indeed been founded, not only was it pitifully
                    abbreviated, inadequate, and poorly administered, but it was not compulsory. Consistently the city
                    fought for educational reforms which rural legislators just as consistently resisted. Nevertheless
                    urban education steadily expanded its offerings with high schools, night schools, domestic,
                    vocational, and musical training; presently the countryside itself adopted these changes. Higher
                    education was represented by Butler University and an assortment of medical and legal schools, while
                    in 1871 the <placeName>

                    pyramid of education which served ninety-five per cent of the community and was termed the best
                    school system in the nation by such prominent educators as Joseph M. Rice and Andrew W. Edson. Here,

                    amount of poverty soar with the increasing population, but the utter depths of wretchedness achieved
                    by slum-dwelling paupers shocked the givers of neighborly benevolence to the marrow of their bones.
                    Under the persuasion of such enlightened leaders as Oscar C. McCulloch, Congregationalist minister
                    and later president of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections, the hit-or-miss
                    charities of the town era were centralized and consolidated into a Charity Organization Society. The
                    result was a scientific study of the causes of poverty out of which evolved a system of social
                    settlements and case work, and the direct aid of government was enlisted for the orphaned poor.</p>
            <p>Likewise urban expansion aggravated transportation problems to an undreamed of extent. The huge
                    volume of city traffic crushed the graveled streets of the central district into a powder, forcing
                    the building of hard surface pavements and sidewalks, and eventually the creation of a traffic
                    squad. Since hard-surfacing was hugely expensive, the city was forced to protect its investment by
                    restricting the destructive excavations of private individuals in the city streets, and utilities
                    thereby became an overwhelming public concern. To keep the city growing, rapid transit, powered by
                    both electricity and gasoline, was given the blessing of urban agencies.</p>
            <p>Urban defense, from a co-operative, neighborly affair, became a major professionalized concern.
                    Defense against fire led to a trained fire department, a city-wide system of pressure water mains to
                    provide firemen with the sinews of war, and the passage of stringent fire laws governing building
                    construction. Defense against crime progressed less certainly. The police force, perennially
                    corrupted by politics, was tardy in adopting mechanical transport, warning devices and such
                    scientific techniques as the Bertillon system. When the passage of a curfew law and the institution
                    of all night street lighting did little to check juvenile delinquency, the local bar in 1902
                    developed one of the earliest juvenile court systems in the country with a staff of volunteer
                    probation investigators which produced effective results.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>But of all urban problems none directly affected the lives of so many city dwellers as that of public
                    health. With a small and relatively diffused population the town of 1860 was able to ignore such
                    matters as disposal of waste, water supply, and contagious disease, and did ignore them with few
                    exceptions. But with the industrial city the mere pressure of heavy concentrated numbers changed
                    things; waste was so enormously increased that it contaminated not only the rivers but the entire
                    subsurface sources of the city's well water supply. The congestion of population also
                    raised the possibility that disease might race through the crowded slum dwellers as disastrously as
                    fire could sweep their wooden homes, Municipal hospitals commenced operation after the Civil War,
                    but the Board of Health was shooting in the dark until the local acceptance of the germ theory of
                    disease in 1886, clearly marked when the prominent and hostile Dr. Joseph W. Marsee announced before

            <p>With the germ theory once accepted, city facilities for research began to give urban physicians an
                    immense advantage over their rural brethren. Moreover, the fear of germs furnished a powerful spur
                    to water purification, sewage disposal, sanitation and compulsory quarantines, at length
                    institutionalized by the creation of a City Sanitarian in 1895.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>Although less universally felt by the masses, the catalytic effect of city growth upon cultural
                    activity was of notable importance. The local pattern of cultural emphasis was much like that of the
                    nation with literature, art, music, and architecture attracting attention in that order. In all
                    fields activity was strongest when prosperity was greatest. Thus the good times in
                    1866–1873 produced the first large-scale literary and artistic movements in the
                    city's history, providing a basis for the remarkable cultural achievements during the <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The urban milieu not only produced a marked development of the arts but also led to the subtle

                    of co-operation and social responsibility that the prevailing individualistic ideology of frontier
                    living was continually breached in the observance. Sometimes lip service was denied it as well. The
                    humanitarian reformer, Oscar McCulloch, declared that the individualistic living which had made
                    possible the achievements of the nineteenth century lacked friendship, love, and community feeling

                    cultural pulls of these urban centers that the fabric of state loyalty seemed seriously threatened.

                    from any natural break in transportation, be it noted—received a great deal of unexpected
                    support. Farmer criticism was strangely mild, the state government proved remarkably receptive to

            <p>It is often asserted that the beginnings of writing probably lie in pictorial art, such as the

                    monuments still extant contain elements having pictographic appearance. But the pictures became so
                    conventionalized in the course of time that in modern writing it is impossible to connect symbols
                    with the objects they originally depicted.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                            the same as in speech. Chinese characters, constituting ideographic word-writing, give no

            <p>The type of writing with the greatest geographical distribution in aboriginal America was pictography
                    or picture-writing: graphic symbols which are not correlated with linguistic forms. The pictured
                    elements—people, dwellings, birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, swastikas, circles,
                    etc—were drawn either with an emphasis on arbitrarily selected detail or without detail,
                    as mere approximations or general outlines. Each system had its own methods of conventionalization.</p>
            <p>The American aborigines pictured objects and events on organic and inorganic materials. The practice
                    of using animal skins for writing surfaces was characteristic of the tribes in the Plains and the
                    Eastern Woodlands; the latter employed bark and wood probably just as extensively. Instances of
                    intra-tribal and inter-tribal communication by means of pictured messages have been reported among
                    the Indians around the Great Lakes region.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all pictographs existing today the most widespread are the figures made by carving, pecking, and
                    painting on stone—petroglyphs. These seem to occur most abundantly in the Great Basin
                    region of the United States. Although a large part of the pictures are recognizable, it is possible
                    to interpret only a small minority of them.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                            <p>Hieroglyphic writing, the extant records of which are of similar antiquity, was also
                                conventionalized but retained realistic pictographic symbols. Both cuneiform, used by
                                the Sumerians and Assyrians, and Egyptian hieroglyphics contained word-characters
                                denoting actual objects and syllable-characters indicating phonetic syllables. In the
                                syllabic hieroglyphs the characters represented only the consonantal elements, as is
                                also the case in early Semitic.</p>
                            <p>Western Semitic writing, employed by the peoples of Canaan with inscriptional evidence
                                dating from about 1400 B. C., was purely syllabic and probably an extension of the
                                Egyptian system. A given sign designated a consonant alone or all the syllables which
                                consisted of that particular consonant in combination with any vowel. As in hieroglyphic
                                writing, the vowels were left for the reader to supply.</p>
                            <p>The syllabic characters of the Semitic orthography were borrowed by the Greeks and
                                adapted by them to an alphabetic form of writing. In this system both vowels and
                                consonants were indicated, and from it our own alphabet is derived. <hi rend="i">Cf</hi>. E. H. Sturtevant, <hi rend="i">Introduction to Linguistic Science</hi> (<placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">forms</hi>.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Mnemonics, records, and uninterpreted forms differ
                    from notices and missives in that they are generally intelligible to only those who made them. The
                    figures in mnemonics remind the writer of particular objects or words equated to the objects in his
                    language. While largely extensions of mnen-onics, records serve to recall complete actions or
                    significant events in their entirety. Both notices and missives are intended to solicit cooperation
                    or interaction between individuals or groups of individuals. Notices disseminate information in
                    general and are more or less permanent, whereas missives, having transitory importance with a sense
                    of urgency, are designed to accomplish a specific objective with a specific person or people. The
                    bulk of pictographs fall into the fifth category—uninterpreted forms: the determination
                    of their function and reason for existence is no longer possible, and the interpretations assigned
                    to them, if any, are wholly conjectural.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Mnemonics</hi> are memory aids. Pictured mnemonics constitute relatively ambiguous
                    partial reports: a single symbol may memorandize a word or an entire phrase or even an idea. Figures
                    incised on birch bark by means of a piece of bone or a nail furnished the Mide'wiwin or
                    Grand Medicine Society of the Ojibwa<hi rend="sup">8</hi> and other Central Algonquian tribes<hi rend="sup">9</hi> with mnemonics for recalling texts of ceremonial chants in initiation rites
                    and in the preparation of medicines. The characters, generally drawn to be read from left to right,
                    marked the order of the stanzas and at the same time were equated to words in the text. Part of a
                    bark mnemonic used by an Ojibwa Mide is reproduced in Figure 1. Following is an English rendition of

            <p>Tribal <hi rend="i">records</hi>—forays, battles, hunts, and other notable events
                    affecting the tribe—were sometimes set down pictographically. Several Plains and

                    count, eight short vertical lines joined by a long stroke below indicated that eight Dakota warriors
                    were slain. The figure of an elk pierced by an arrow and blood flowing from the wound signified a
                    successful hunt, in which a large number of the animals were killed.</p>
            <p>A tepee with cloven hoof prints in front of it indicated that buffalo were so plentiful that year,
                    their tracks came close to the camp area. An outbreak of measles was denoted by a rough outline of a
                    blotched head and body. The figures had a spiral arrangement, beginning in a center and continually
                    receding from it. Lone Dog's count covered a seventy-year period, starting with the winter

                    1880. Single pictures represented varying periods of time between 901 and 1.700 based on tribal
                    traditions, but starting with the latter date, yearly accounts were maintained in substantially the
                    same fashion as Lone Dog's calendar. Good, who lived only in the 19th century, gathered his
                    material for years from the old people of the tribe and placed the events in chronological order.

                    recorded such feats as taking weapons from the enemy, successful scouting expeditions, stealing

                    signify unity of feeling and purpose. Nos. 2, 3, and 4 are warriors of the Marten totem. No. 5 is
                    from the Bear totem, and No, 6 from the Manfish totem. The line drawn forward from the

                    pictures (Figures 10 and 11) show a tree; but <hi rend="i">-tlan</hi> is expressed as two rows of
                    teeth because of its phonetic similarity to <hi rend="i">tlantli</hi>, meaning
                    ‘tooth.’ And <hi rend="i">-nahuac</hi> is expressed as a mouth opening with a
                    little tongue in front of it, which is the usual sign for speech: <hi rend="i">nuahuatl</hi>
                    ‘distinct speech.’ Coat-<hi rend="i">zinco</hi> means ‘small
                    Coatlan’ and <hi rend="i">Coatlan</hi> itself means ‘place where there are
                    snakes.’ In accordance with this, the picture (Figure 12) contains a snake, but the
                    ending <hi rend="i">-tzinco</hi> ‘small’ is shown by the lower half of a
                    man's body almost in profile, for <hi rend="i">tzintli</hi> means ‘the lower
                    back part.’ <hi rend="i">Xilotepec</hi> signifies ‘place of the
                    maize’ and is represented correspondingly by a figure, which is the sign for mountain
                        (<hi rend="i">tepetl</hi>) and by two ears of maize (<hi rend="i">xilotl</hi>) with the large
                    tassels dependant (Figure 13). <hi rend="i">Tepeyacac</hi> means ‘on the mountain
                    summit.’ It is composed of the word <hi rend="i">tepetl</hi>
                    ‘mountain’ and <hi rend="i">yacatli</hi> ‘nose’ and is
                    accordingly expressed by the sign for mountain with a nose upon it (Figure 14). The endings <hi rend="i">-c</hi> and <hi rend="i">-co</hi> which occur in all but the first example are locative
                    suffixes and thus are not specifically referred to in the writing.</p>

                        sciences."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> The students of Maya glyphs, since the appearance of
                    Bishop de Landa's alphabet<hi rend="sup">50</hi> in 1864, have generally been of the
                    opinion that the writing system contains both ideographic and phonetic characters.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> The extent of phoneticism has been argued variously. Forstemann, Schellhas, and Seler have
                    held that the glyphs are almost, if not completely, ideographic. The French scholars, Brasseur de
                    Bourbourg, de Rosny, and Charencey have worked on the assumption that they were predominantly
                    phonetic, and some of the early American investigators, such as Thomas, Cresson, and Le Plongeon,
                    have taken a similar stand.</p>
            <p>Landa's alphabet, published by the Abbe Brasseur, proved a disappointment. What appeared to
                    be a Maya Rosetta stone in the form of a complete phonetic alphabet, was no key to the script at
                    all. Charencey, Brasseur de Bourbourg, and de Rosny met with only negative results. Valentini
                    condemned the alphabet as a "Spanish fabrication." Brinton stated that the Landa
                    alphabet proved some degree of phoneticism and that the glyphs are probably ideographic and
                    phonetic, operating the same way as in Aztec writing. Bowditch also subscribed to this statement. Le
                    Plongeon, Thomas, and Cresson contended that by extending the alphabet beyond 27 characters, a key
                    had been found. Morley and Spinden cling to the assumption of the ideographic principle, but at the
                    same time, are hopeful with regard to the phonetic side.</p>

                    open with divided opinions. And an additional question has arisen as to whether the glyphs are
                    simply a cluster of ideographic signs devoid of any grammatical relationships, or a graphic system
                    recording actual speech utterances.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Among the recent investigators, Whorf

                    alphabeticism where the inherent vowel of the syllabic sign was not employed or was reinforced or
                    varied by the addition of another sign; ideographic signs were also much used, both to designate
                    words and as redundant explanatory signs …."<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Long<hi rend="sup">56</hi> and Beyer, on the other hand, hold the view that the glyphs are almost
                    entirely mnemonic signs, non-phonetic in character, constituting no linguistic constructions. An
                    intermediate position is taken by Gates and Willard, who contend that the undeciphered glyphs,
                    although mainly ideographic, form a writing system, both nouns and verbs indicated by it, comparable
                    to the Egyptian system. The evidences presented so far in either direction are far from conclusive
                    and can serve only as a basis for future work.</p>

            <p>Indiana's position as one of the leading iron and steel producing areas in the world is well
                    known. The state's growth in this respect dates from the establishment of the United States
                    Steel Corporation in Gary in 1907. Since that time the iron ore used in pig iron manufacture has
                    been brought from outside the state, chiefly from the Lake Superior district. This tendency toward
                    using out-of-state ores showed roughly forty years earlier when the pig iron production of the state
                    came partly from local ores. The early iron industry in Indiana, from 1833, when the first blast
                    furnace was erected, to the turn of the century, presents an interesting picture.</p>
            <p>It was believed by many in the early decades after the Civil War that Indiana would soon rival
                    Pennsylvania in iron manufacture.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> That feeling was largely due to the knowledge
                    that Indiana possessed deposits of iron ore. The reports of the state geologist and other scientists
                    that Indiana should rise to the forefront in iron production, however, were largely based upon
                    considerations of Indiana's location with respect to the Lake Superior and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> ore fields, her possession of a large and unique coal deposit peculiarly adapted to
                    iron smelting, and her enormous limestone deposits.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The expectation that the
                    state's iron production from local ores would make her the leader in this industry were, of
                    course, of the most extreme optimism. There is some evidence, however, that Indiana's
                    production of pig iron from local ores was once of great importance in supplying local markets and
                    for the production of both wrought iron and Bessemer steel rails.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>The kind of iron which occurs most frequently in Indiana is limonite, but siderite is also found in
                    considerable deposits.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Limonite in the form of bog ore was used to a great
                    extent in Indiana pig iron manufacture prior to the Civil War.</p>
            <p>These ores contain impurities of various kinds. Indiana ores contain a high percentage of silica,
                    some alumina and lime, from a trace to 1.03 per cent of phosphorus, from a trace to more than two
                    per cent of sulphur, and from a trace to nearly one per cent of rnanganese.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                    Most of these impurities are detrimental. A high per cent of silica increases the quantity of lime
                    required for fluxing; sulphur tends to weaken the metal after reduction; small quantities of lime
                    are not detrimental, but large amounts must be removed by fluxing; phosphorus above one-tenth of one
                    per cent is harmful in the manufacture of Bessemer steel from pig iron containing it. Alumina,
                    however, may be recovered in the form of slag, which, when it contains enough, may be used to
                    manufacture <placeName>

                                extracted: Magnetite (Fe<hi rend="sub">3</hi>O<hi rend="sub">4</hi>) 72.24 per cent of

                                er cent of iron, Siderite (FeCO<hi rend="sub">3</hi>) 48.27 per cent of iron. They are
                                described as follows: "Magnetite is a black mineral, very hard and heavy, and
                                strongly magnetic. It occurs in veins, in lens-like masses and as grains in sands. Aside
                                from an occasional crystal of magnetite found in glacial boulders it does not occur in
                                Indiana except as sand grains.</p>
                            <p>
                        <hi rend="i">"Hematite</hi>. This is a red or steel gray mineral which has a red
                                streak, a slightly lower specific gravity than magnetite. It occurs in many forms and
                                colors. It may be in the form of a powder, granular, nodular, irregular or massive. Red
                                ocher is a mixture of hematite and clay. It occurs in small quantities in many places in
                                Mississippian and Pennsylvanian strata in Indiana.</p>
                            <p>
                        <hi rend="i">"Limonite</hi>. This ore of iron occurs in a number of forms, as
                                nodular, botryoidal, vesicular, stalactitic, massive or as powder in clay forming yellow
                                or brown ocher. Its color is variable, but usually black brown or yellow. Its specific
                                gravity is low, 3.8. It has a yellow streak which easily distinguishes it from hematite.
                                It also contains water of crystallization and is often associated with other iron ores
                                which are hydrous. This is the most abundant form of iron ore in Indiana. It occurs as
                                concretions in soils, which are poorly drained; as bog ore in swamps and marshes; as
                                lenses, irregular masses, nodules and distinct layers in the rock strata.</p>
                            <p>
                        <hi rend="i">"Siderite</hi>. This is a brown to gray colored ore. It occurs as
                                lenses, concretions or as massive or granular masses. Its principal form of occurrence
                                in Indiana is in nodular masses and lenses in shales and clays."</p>

                    indicated. All of the counties in the southwest corner of the state have traces of ore, which are
                    mainly within the coal-bearing strata; but some of them are not worth noting. The legend of Figure 1
                    explains the occurrence of the ore. The Mississip-pian is the earliest period in the Indiana
                    geological time scale in which iron ore is known to occur, and the Pennsylvanian is the next most
                    recent. Northern Indiana is assigned normally to the Devonian and partly to the Silurian and
                    Missis-sipian periods; the Devonian and Silurian are older geologically than the Mississippian. The
                    bog ores of the northern tier of counties, however, were formed after the Pleistocene (modern)
                    glaciation; therefore, the ores of this area are designated as Post-Pleistocene. It must further be
                    noted that these divisions of the ores are not precise; bog ores occur in most of the southern
                    counties indicated, and of course ores in the Pennsylvanian and Mississippian periods are not
                    confined exactly to the counties indicated. The divisions, however, are generally accurate enough to
                    be useful.</p>
            <p>In attempting an appraisal of the economic characteristics of the ores, one may examine the per cent
                    of iron yielded. The table below gives the information that is available.</p>

                    <pb n="357" id="VAA4025-045-4-035"/> It may be seen that all of the counties shown in Figure 1 do
                    not appear in the above table, mainly for two reasons: difficulty in locating data; and the fact
                    that some counties' ore deposits were never worked, and no estimates or sample tests made.
                    The information available gives a picture of the comparative yield of Indiana ores. The estimates
                    run from twenty-eight to sixty-five per cent, the samples tested from twenty-five to sixty-six per
                    cent. The figures for the Post-Pleistocene period are of little significance because of the
                    sparseness of material. The bog ores, however, do run much higher in yield than the others. It is
                    the smallness of individual bog deposits that limits their usefulness, and partly for this reason
                    one may discount them. The Mississippian data are insignificant because this ore has not been
                    worked. The Pennsylvanian is the formation which has been worked the most as well as that having the
                    greatest deposits of ore in the state.<hi rend="sup">l0</hi>

                    </placeName> ranks first in the state in ore deposits. Of the deposits which had been investigated
                    by 1906 (little, if anything, has been done since), the samples of which give a fair representation
                    in the above table, Shannon said, "The deposits described would yield a total of more than
                    six million tons of workable ore and the smaller deposits when worked out would probably increase
                    the tonnage about one-half. And the investigation of the yet unexplored area where the same
                    conditions exist would at least double the tonnage of the present field." The county
                    ranking second in the state is <placeName>

            <p>An interesting fact emerging from this table is the range of yields in the ore. It is evident that no

                    </placeName>. Another notable consideration is the dispersal of the deposits. Although the largest

                        <region type="county">Martin County</region>
                    </placeName>, the upper tier of counties is a spotty mass of hundreds of small deposits of bog ore.
                    A third factor, not revealed by the table, is that this ore in the Pennsylvanian formation is not
                    usually available for strip mining since layers of clay, shale, limestone, etc., often occur with
                    the layers of coal and iron ore.</p>
            <p>In summary, the economic characteristics of Indiana iron ore are as follows: the yield of the
                    available ore is probably thirty-five to forty per cent, deposits vary widely in yield, they are
                    small and dispersed, and continuous strip mining is not feasible. When these characteristics are
                    contrasted with those of the Lake Superior region, it is quickly seen that here is sufficient reason
                    why iron ore extraction was abandoned in Indiana. Mesabi (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>) ores run from fifty to seventy-two per cent yield and average about sixty-three per
                    cent. The deposit is up to three hundred feet deep, roughly one hundred miles long, of highly
                    uniform yield, at least for a large easily-worked area, and continuous strip mining is possible.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Machinery need never be removed from one deposit until it is to be replaced.
                    The five or six other great fields of the Lake Superior region have similar characteristics.</p>
            <p>Yet, not only before the exploitation of the Lake Superior region (roughly the 1850's), but
                    after its fame had become widespread, Indiana iron ore was used to some extent, in declining
                    amounts, to be sure, until about the 1890's. For the economic factors determining such use
                    one must look to the history of pig iron manufacturing in Indiana during this period because the
                    demand for iron ore is derived from the demand for pig iron, which is basic to iron and steel
                    manufacture.</p>

                    Indiana were several iron plants using bog ore other than the ones indicated, chiefly Catalan

                    iron was cast into kettles of various kinds and other crude forms for the pioneer settlers. At a

                    ensued. Smelting was discontinued in 1856, probably due to the exhaustion of ore deposits in the
                    locality, possibly to high fuel costs, and perhaps because the railroad brought cheap bar iron from

                  <item>Catalonia, Spain, was an open kettle-like furnace containing charcoal and iron ore the
                            heat of which was increased by a continuous blast entering near the bottom of the
                            "kettle," produced by the fall of water through a few feet of closed shaft
                            into a closed container, the water escaping by a pipe. The melted iron, containing much slag
                            and a high content of impurity, as well as comparatively little carbon, was caught in the
                            bottom of the "kettle." The blast furnace was (and still remains basically
                            the same) by way of contrast, a closed tower into which was charged continuously from the
                            top the "make" of coke or coal, iron ore and limestone. The blast was
                            produced by mechanical blowers of much greater capacity than the Catalan water method,
                            entering through tuyeres near the bottom of the tower. The ore was exposed longer to higher
                            temperatures, absorbing more carbon from the fuel but separating more efficiently the slag
                            and impurities. The pig iron of the blast furnace was drawn out from the hearth below the
                            "boshes" which was the lowest oint of the tower to which the
                            "make" gradually descended as it fused. Pig iron was brittle, with a high
                            carbon content. The product of the Catalan Forge, produced at higher cost because of fuel
                            waste due to the moisture content of the blast and the inefficient open furnace and also
                            because of lack of as complete reduction of the ore as was possible in the blast furnace,
                            was soft compared to pig iron, containing less carbon. This iron was often forged directly

                            is of itself very strong and able to bear up as much burden as coke, but it is, by the heat
                            in the upper part of the furnace, converted into a dense coke before it meets the blast
                            where it enters into perfect combustion. That my readers may comprehend the important part
                            performed by the blast, I will state that more than five tons of air are required for every
                            ton of pig iron smelted. From the fact that the raw coal is changed to coke before it is
                            burned, the effect produced by the two fuels, coke and raw coal, are the same in the zone of
                            fusion, and it is only in the upper part of the furnace that we must look for dissimilar
                            effects. Here the raw coal is gradually heated and the hydrogen and hydrocarbons, which form
                            about forty parts of its substance, are distilled off and the gaseous contents of the shaft
                            are, consequently, about thirty-seven per cent greater than when coke is the fuel; it
                            follows therefore that if the size of the throat and gas flues are properly adjusted for
                            coke, they must be made, at least, one third larger for raw coal. If this point is not
                            attended to the furnace must lose heat, through want of perfect combustion, run irregular,
                            and consume vastly more fuel per ton of pig iron made."</item>

                    consumed daily about one hundred and fifty tons of iron ore, three hundred tons of block coal, and
                    fifty tons of limestone. The daily production of pig iron was about one hundred and ten tons.
                    Approximately two hundred men were employed at the furnaces, and a great many more in the coal mines

            </p>
            <p>Indiana pig iron manufacture can be placed historically in three rather well-defined periods: (1)
                    before the Civil War, or 1833–1860; (2) from the Civil War to the turn of the century, or
                    1867–1895; and (3) since the turn of the century, or 1907 to the present time. Because
                    Indiana iron ore extraction occurred in the first two periods, the significant facts of them may now
                    be considered.</p>
            <p>From 1833 to 1860, one finds in every case but one the location of the blast furnace or Catalan Forge
                    at the source of the ore. In each of these cases, the ore deposits seemed to be the principal factor
                    which drew the enterprise into existence. It should be emphasized, however, that the fuel supply,
                    timber from which the charcoal was made, existed in each of the locations. The reduction of timber
                    conveniently available has been given as partial cause of discontinuing operations. The widespread
                    limestone deposits of Indiana insured a local supply of flux for the furnaces. One can readily see,
                    therefore, the importance of the raw materials in the immediate vicinity in which each smelter was
                    located. The influence of the market was also important, but evidently of less importance for
                    location purposes than the availability of raw materials. Most of the iron, particularly that of the
                    forges, was sold locally, but some of it was shipped to distant markets. The pig iron of the Old <placeName>

                    discontinuance of its operations.</p>
            <p>In the second period, 1867 to 1895, the location of raw materials again seems the chief consideration
                    in the location of the furnaces. The ore deposits, however, yield in importance to block coal.
                    Undoubtedly, the concentration of five furnaces around Brazil in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Clay County</region>
                    </placeName> was due to the deposits of block coal there. The greater part of the ore was now coming

                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, and some locally. Only the Shoals furnace in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin County</region>
                    </placeName> used local ore exclusively. Near-by deposits of limestone, however, were available for
                    all the furnaces. The market was not as important a locating factor since the iron of the Planet

                        <region type="state" reg="county">Clay County</region>

                    </placeName> firms must have gone to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> or to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, thirteen or fourteen miles distant. The market in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, however, was probably the chief locating factor in the establishment of the Vigo
                    furnace. Transportation was largely by rail, although short wagon hauls were necessary in some cases
                    to reach railheads.</p>
            <p>While the market factor was not the principal one in the location of individual furnaces, one can
                    discern a broad principle here. The product of the Indiana smelters was used to a large extent in
                    Indiana. The limit of shipment to market seems to have been about one hundred miles. Rolling mills
                    at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Terre

                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> obtained much or all of their pig iron from Indiana smelters. Wrought iron and Bessemer
                    steel rails for the expanding railroads of the time were manufactured in addition to stoves,
                    kettles, and a multitude of other products.</p>
            <p>When the localizing factors of these two early periods are contrasted with those of the period after
                    1907, at the time "big steel" arrived in Indiana, one notes a change in the role
                    of the market. The location in the Calumet region, while scientifically calculated to be a point of
                    low cost for assembling raw materials—Lake Superior ore, Indiana <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-045-4-046"/>
                    <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and Pennsylvania coal; and Indiana limestone—also indicates the growing
                    importance of the market. As the percentage of pig iron going into steel declined because it was
                    replaced by scrap, the market factor became more important. That scrap is an important aspect of the
                    market for steel products is seen most clearly in the growing steel industry in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Evidences of integration exist in the two early periods. Most of the companies owned their coal
                    mines, and those using local ore as a rule owned their deposits of ore. Some of the firms made
                    finished iron goods. This reached a high state of development with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Rolling Mill Company, which owned and operated a rolling mill, blast furnace, coal
                    fields, and ore deposits. That company is a good example of early vertical integration.</p>
            <p>The length of life of the Indiana smelters in both early periods was impressive. The first one, built
                    in 1833, ran until 1856, a period of twenty-three years. The five in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Clay County</region>
                    </placeName> must have operated nearly this long and perhaps longer. The Vigo furnace ran for
                    twenty-five years. When one reflects that the average length of life of the business enterprise in
                    the United States by modern standards is about five and one-half years,<hi rend="sup">32</hi> the
                    Indiana blast furnaces, regardless of differences in the development of the economy, were highly
                    successful, gauged by length of operation.</p>
            <p>The tremendous influence of transportation must again be noted. Railroads furnished an important part
                    of the market for iron and steel products derived from Indiana pig iron. Moreover, as markets
                    expanded because of more efficient transportation facilities, competition became keener, and some
                    enterprises expired due to the arrival of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> iron on the Indiana markets. Of course, in the third period in Indiana iron development
                    these eastern ironworks could stay in the Indiana market only through the peculiar pricing system
                    used by the steel industry.</p>

            <p>Colonel Lathrop M. Taylor sold his general store, which he had operated at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> since 1836 in October, 1847, but continued in business as a fur trader. He occasionally
                    accepted products for barter and accumulated large stores of furs for spring shipment. It is not
                    known where he conducted his business at this time, but it was probably in his own home or in a
                    portion of his former store. Information on this period is limited because the pages of the Sales
                    Book for 1847, 1848, and part of 1849 were removed, and there were few entries after 1855.
                    Taylor's ability to maintain the store through the panic of 1837 was due partly to help
                    received from William Brewster of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> who extended advances on expected fur shipments. Brewster became bankrupt in 1848 and
                    the litigation was settled in 1880. Taylor lost $779.13 in the business failure.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This may have been due to a loan but was probably due to Brewster's
                    failure to pay for a shipment of furs.</p>
            <p>Several fur shipments were made in the spring of 1849 which totaled $2,283.62. The
                    shipment sent to Chauteau and Skelton of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> was sold under contract of a ten per cent increase in the price paid to Taylor.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Such arrangements were occasionally made for furs which were prime or to give
                    the seller the advantage of price increases.</p>
            <p>Gradually Taylor's dependence upon the Indians for his fur trade lessened because their
                    lands came into the possession of the whites. The treaty of Council Bluffs in 1846 was the last
                    general agreement made to acquire the remaining Potawatomi lands in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    taken place in 1851 when Alexes Coquillard had taken a band west, there were still Indians in <placeName>

                    Indians, though he did not record the sending of outfits to them. The bulk of his furs undoubtedly
                    came from the white settlers at this time.</p>
            <p>Thaddeus S. Taylor stated in an unpublished biography of his father that the total volume of business
                    remained large and the latter did a total fur business of eighteen thousand dollars in

            <p>This list is probably complete. Single shipments were made in March and April and three in May. A
                    comparison of the number of deer and mink show that there were fewer sold in 1853 than in either
                    1851 or 1852. A study of the price averages discloses Taylor received ten cents each for muskrat
                    skins in 1851 and less than eight cents each in 1852. Raccoon prices declined from about
                    seventy-five cents to fifty cents. Deer were about twenty cents in 1851 and increased to about
                    seventy cents in 1852, although the former price seems questionable. Mink were fairly stable at
                    about seventy cents. Otter were the rarest and most valuable skins taken. They usually sold for five
                    to six dollars apiece.</p>
            <p>Colonel Taylor's volume of business declined rapidly after 1853. He sold furs worth
                    $739.54 in 1854, $1,069.64 in 1855, and a negligible amount in 1856.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> He also sold minor quantities of supplies, clothing, and groceries, and bought
                    cranberries, rags, and groceries.</p>
            <p>Taylor ended all records but his Suspended Ledger by 1856 when he was fifty-one years old. He
                    expressed the belief that no one should continue in active work after the age of sixty and practiced
                    his philosophy with some years to spare.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> A record of gifts and donations was
                    kept in the Suspended Ledger, which included some interesting sidelights, until June 1, 1892. Most
                    of the gifts and donations were small —ten cents or a quarter were common. Even each
                    article of clothing given away was valued for the record. The total reached by June 1, 1892, was
                    $10,810.41, a very considerable sum, much of which was given to the Indians.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> As early as 1860 his brother Horace's account was written off as a

            <p>For a man with as many diverse interests as Colonel Taylor possessed, the last forty years of his
                    life present a marked contrast to his early career. There was a gradual transition from the
                    activities of the shrewd businessman and community promoter, to that of a passive symbol of a
                    pioneer past. After he retired, he sat at his corner home for many years and watched the activities
                    of the "leading citizens" who succeeded him, most of whom he survived.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Taylor was the subject of occasional articles of reminiscences, but no
                    personal records or newspaper notices which contribute to this study until his death on August 29,

                    to be full justice done to his part in the affairs of the community from 1827 to about 1845, but
                    there is no mention of any later activities. The suspicion of financial contributions attached to
                    the early county histories may have caused Taylor to avoid publicity which sometimes bore a price
                    tag. "A Thirty-Onester" was the author of a series of reminiscences in 1876, who
                    characterized Taylor in a manner that may offer a clue to his later life. "He was
                    methodical, orderly and honest in everything he did. I have often thought his retiring habits and

            <p>Taylor's career after the sale of his store may be divided into two parts: nine years of
                    operation as a fur buyer and a long period of retirement until his death. His fur trade reached a
                    climax about 1851 to 1853 and then dwindled to practically nothing by 1856. The final removal of the
                    Pota-watomi in 1851 did not greatly influence the quantity of furs obtained as these were now
                    brought in by the whites. Colonel Taylor ended his last civic office tenure at about the same time
                    that he withdrew from business. He then retired to live on the modest returns from his investments
                    and maintained a complete disinterestedness in business or community leadership for thirty-six
                    years. The Suspended Ledger was maintained, a proof of his methodical habits, until a few months
                    before his death. The biographies agreed upon his calmness, which may also explain his contentment
                    in retirement after the heavy burdens of his first twenty years in <placeName>

            <p>Taylor's career can be summarized as an implementation of his earliest purposes when
                    settling at the south bend of the river. He was sent to develop a fine natural location for white
                    settlement; he exhibited untiring efforts to establish that site and capitalize on his commercial
                    position; and finally, he retired to peaceful enjoyment of a successful but strenuous career. His
                    early activities were marked by the four-year period in which he served as clerk of S. Hanna and
                    Company at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the succeeding five years spent as a partner with Hanna in the store and in
                    developing the advantages of his primary location. From 1836 to 1847 he was the sole proprietor of
                    the L. M. Taylor store, and his major effort was to prevent his financial failure during the panic
                    of 1837. He capitalized on his success during the panic, and after selling his store in 1847
                    continued to operate for about ten years as an independent fur buyer. He then retired from active
                    business until his death in 1892.</p>
            <p>Taylor was primarily a trader for Indian goods. He moved to the <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName>
                    more than two years before <placeName>

                    western reservations and had given up their reserves of land in the state. As a trader,
                    Taylor's success depended on his relationship with these Indians and thus was affected by
                    every aspect of the Indian problem. This area had not been opened for white settlers in 1827, but it
                    was the next region to be acquired by treaty. The Indian problem was quickly eliminated in northern
                    Indiana. In 1838, the procedure was decided upon, and the final removals were made in 1851, twenty
                    years after the white settlers gained entry to the land.</p>
            <p>A study of Taylor's work shows many Indians remained in this territory after the government
                    removals to the west. The following table is a record of the number of names carried in his account
                    for the period, and it is proof that the treaties and westward removals did not greatly change the
                    Indian population of this district.</p>

            <p>The Treaty of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> on October 27, 1832, was the most fully documented agreement with which Taylor was
                    concerned. In addition to showing the type of goods used for payment at the treaties it gave proof
                    of unsavory practices of the treaty commissioners and traders. The latter sold their goods at
                    increased prices on their disbursement sheets for payment by the federal government at the expense
                    of the Indians and federal taxpayers. The commissioners or traders who served as subcommissioners to
                    certify each others' invoiced goods probably profited by the arrangement. Taylor did not
                    confirm any account for others, but his partner, Hanna, confirmed many at this treaty. After
                    Taylor's invoice had been copied by three other traders, the prices were raised, and the
                    invoices were then certified by commissioners and subcommissioners for collection. Taylor received
                    the orders for payment and could not have been ignorant of the process, even if he failed to profit
                    from the scheme. Other Indian treaties did not concern Taylor so much since remaining ones were made
                    with individual bands, and even at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> settlement of 1833 he was not successful in selling a large stock of merchandise. He
                    may have benefited from some, but there is no evidence that he did.</p>
            <p>The Indian settlements were the most important feature of his early business years. By this system he
                    was sure of collection of the accounts in which he had extended credit to the buyers of his
                    merchandise, although the prices were undoubtedly high and some of the goods of poor quality.
                    Taylor's invoices proved that the Indians bought more useful goods than was usually thought
                    to be the case. The settlements at <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="county">Tippecanoe</region>,
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
               </placeName>, and that made by General William
                    B. Mitchell were the most important events in Taylor's Indian <pb n="377" id="VAA4025-045-4-055"/> trade. He obtained good money from the government by this feature of
                    its Indian policy which gave him the necessary financial stability. The fur trade was a quick source
                    of money which enabled the traders to deal with the Indians and indirectly with the federal
                    government. It was a temporary source which helped finance Taylor and others. They in turn were able
                    to start more permanent commercial sources of wealth.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been indicated that Taylor dealt primarily in furs and other Indian goods, although he entered
                    into other lines of merchandise as fast as his market permitted. He undoubtedly used this trade to
                    acquire both choice lands and a price lower than the government acts specified. The trader abandoned
                    the complex general store business when he had acquired a small fortune and returned to the fur
                    trade, which was comparatively uncomplicated because collections were sure, and he knew that the
                    Indians would soon cease to be a source of trade and furs.</p>
            <p>Taylor's decision to concentrate on fur activities may also have been partly due to banking
                    and other financial problems which plagued the frontier merchant. Taylor used credit sales in which
                    no interest was charged; notes, at ten and twenty per cent interest; drafts on mercantile houses and
                    banks which could be exchanged for currency but were usually discounted each time they changed
                    hands; and the bank notes of the day. He seemed to prefer notes as a means of credit extension,
                    although they often required legal process for collection. The drafts were usually used as a
                    convenient form of exchange for large payments in the east and depended on the reputation for
                    integrity of the firms concerned. Paper currency was the most irritating medium of exchange because
                    it was dependent on so many factors, especially distance and negotiability, that the merchant was
                    constantly threatened with losses. Currency which was accepted in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He soon found, however, that this was not a satisfactory solution to his need for a
                    universally accepted form of exchange. As a Whig, he probably saw in the federal Indian treaty
                    settlements a proof of the need for a national currency.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                    competing with more accessible areas of the state. The Canal-Great Lakes route permitted rapid
                    settlement and commercial development of the Lakes region in the Old Northwest. The question of
                    transportation facilities determined the financial allegiance of this part of the state.

                    and merchants. He saw the desirability of an east-west railroad, but it is important that he had no
                    desire or need for a north-south railroad. He did not remain in business long after the railroad was
                    established, and it had no effect on his success.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> history has always been based on his active part in the establishment of the town. He
                    was co-owner of the platted townsite with Coquillard, and they used every means to make their
                    location the county seat. Taylor may have been aware of the movement in the Indiana legislature to
                    open this area for land sales and to establish <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                    </placeName>. If he did not know what was being done, he at least was ready for such action. He held
                    three county offices and one federal office simultaneously and soon added the commanding rank in the
                    local militia regiment. He was a leader in movements toward civic expansion or improvements for
                    fifteen years. These usually required time and occasionally money of a man who had fairly extensive
                    business interests. Another effect Taylor exercised on the small community must be considered. His
                    success, extension of credit to numerous settlers, and retail sales of a general stock of goods were
                    important to the community. If he had used different financial policies, his customers would have

                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> became bankrupt in a short time. Their failures were unfortunate, especially when the
                    services they should have rendered to the settlers of the new community are taken into account.
                    Taylor's material success, on the other hand, reflected to some degree the extent to which
                    he performed essential services for his customers.</p>
            <p>The fur trader's real estate activities have already been mentioned. The most important
                    feature was the purchase of <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-045-4-058"/> the tract of land from Peter Gebo
                    which became Taylor's share of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> townsite. He recognized its strategic value, for it was bought as soon as land entries
                    were authorized, and evidently secured before that time. It was an expensive and difficult job to
                    clear the title, but the tract was the key to Hanna and Company's dominant position in the
                    new town. Taylor later bought other farms, usually from Indians. Most of these were entered as
                    purchases from the United States but were actually reserved lands. There is no way to learn whether
                    he believed these to be choice sections or only a method by which he liquidated some of his Indian
                    accounts, but most of them were not financially important.</p>
            <p>His profits on such transactions were usually modest, except on the Gebo tract and an <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Elkhart County</region>
                    </placeName> tract.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> He was not a land speculator in the usual sense but bought
                    from his Indian customers whenever it was advantageous to do so. These land purchases were important
                    to Taylor, and although he experienced great difficulty in clearing some of the claims, his
                    brother-in-law, he also served the interests of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>From the summary of Colonel Taylor's business activities the following conclusions can be
                    drawn. Samuel Hanna should be given much credit for his contributions to the success of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His company was responsible for the selection of the site for its trading post, it
                    supplied the financial resources and plans necessary to start the new town, and it continued to
                    share in the town's development for twenty years. Hanna helped to stabilize its financial
                    structure through the panic of 1837, and while he was primarily serving himself and his
                    brother-in-law, he also served the interests of <placeName>

            <p>The furs of the Indian trade supplied the primary cash resource for pioneer settlement. The retail
                    stores of the period depended on the Indian trade and government settlements to furnish sound
                    currency. They could not survive on the early white trade which required liberal credit and brought
                    in barter produce and unsound money. Settlements were usually established on sound economic bases by
                    the time the Indian trade was completed.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>The careful, unspectacular, but sound business methods of Taylor were a necessary forerunner to the
                    town's success. He assured his own success and in so doing was able to carry his customers
                    and his financial plans through difficult times. He performed services for the new settlers which
                    assisted them to prosper, while failure in the first years would have handicapped the development of
                    the community.</p>
            <p>The importance of the northeastern Atlantic merchants nearly equaled that of the federal Indian
                    policy. The West was commercially and financially dependent on those cities. Taylor was directly

                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but other real estate affairs will bear close inspection. He did not sell whiskey to
                    Indians after he assumed control of his store, which was unusually ethical during his ownership. He
                    attempted to evade a transaction with Brewster by making a better sale in <placeName>

                    Brewster against the Ewings in 1839 was questionable there was no actual dishonesty involved.</p>
            <p>Although Taylor was very active in community affairs while his business affairs were directly
                    involved in the settlement's prosperity, he ceased his activity after both were assured of
                    permanence. The very extent of his activities lend weight to the conclusion that he did not retire
                    from community life for wholly selfish reasons, but that his recurring and serious physical
                    disabilities were a major factor. His solution was effective, for he was active until his death at
                    the age of eighty-seven.</p>

            <p>The social security and public welfare programs did not spring into full bloom in 1935 and 1936. They
                    grew slowly, out of changing conditions, to meet the needs of the citizens of the community. Almost
                    the entire development of the present welfare system has taken place within the memories of persons
                    now living.</p>
            <p>Developments in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName> are indicative of what has been woven into the present public welfare program.
                    Therefore, something of the history of Indiana welfare will be presented using <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName> as an illustration. Personal experiences and knowledge, conversations with older men
                    and women, to a large extent recorded history, official correspondence and reports, and old
                    newspaper accounts will serve as the sources.</p>
            <p>Public provisions for dependency were few in pioneer days, but compared with the developments of the
                    times they were adequate. The early settlers were rugged people, who felt that all persons should be
                    self-sufficient, and families were responsible for the care of dependent relatives. If public relief
                    was harsh and stringent, so also was ordinary daily living. Money was scarce, and commodities were
                    frequently used as a medium of exchange. Any expenditure of public funds was a highly personal
                    matter with all the taxpayers. Standards of living were comparatively low in their own households,
                    and it would have been inconsistent to provide more for persons considered shiftless and lazy. The
                    professional approach with which most of today's problems are met was then unknown.</p>
            <p>Yet there was public need then, just as there has always been, and it was met. From the very
                    beginning of this nation the community, either through its churches, neighborhoods, or organized
                    government, has assumed responsibility for unfortunate citizens. This philosophy of aid had

                    composed of the aged, the blind, the sick, and the crippled to whom society felt it owed aid and
                    protection.</p>
            <p>As in most sections of the United States, the Northwest Territory's and Indiana's
                    early poor laws were based on the old Elizabethan poor laws. The territorial laws of 1790 made
                    provision for the poor through the appointment of township overseers of the poor.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Indiana's constitution of 1816 (effective until the constitution of 1851) and the
                    laws written under it provided in general for five types of public assistance: Indoor relief in
                    which persons were placed in poor asylums or poor farms under the care of county officials; the
                    contract system in which the people as a group were placed with a private individual who was paid by
                    the county; the farming out system in which the people, individually, were placed in the care of
                    private citizens who were paid by the county; the apprentice system of binding out minor children;
                    and outdoor relief, in which the individuals and families were given relief in their own homes.</p>
            <p>Though Hoosiers everywhere have a great deal in common, there are many variations in the patterns of
                    early community settlements, among which are origins of nationalities, religions, purposes for
                    migrating to Indiana, and economic status. Although <placeName>

                        poor.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> They came mainly for the purpose of establishing homes in the new
                    state. There were several neighborhoods of Quakers in early <placeName>

                    </placeName> who were well known for their hospitality and neighborliness. A fraternal and helpful
                    spirit prevailed among the people. There was work for everyone, and everyone worked hard. Church
                    activities, however, were of first importance among them. Among popular community activities were
                    quilting bees, corn husking, apple parings, log rollings, house raisings, sugar boilings, and

            <p>Nineteenth century community responsibility for dependency was dispatched principally through the

                    wards of the state and should have the best possible treatment. Three new hospitals for the insane
                    were established in 1883. A sixth hospital and a diagnostic center were provided for by the

                    hundred children under the age of sixteen were still to be housed in county homes, though there is
                    some doubt as to this figure's completeness. Legislation in 1881 authorized the

                    sister, Ada, took nine children. Five years later the rate was increased to thirty cents per day for

                    institution, and a few orphans of soldiers were admitted to a small building on the grounds. Six
                    years later, the larger building burned and the soldiers occupying it were transferred to the

                    our responsibility to God for, at least, giving them the opportunity for improvement, and every
                    person throughout the country partakes in a greater or less degree, in this responsibility. To meet
                    these evils, the Charities Aid Society was organized. It's object is to provide work, food,

                    the times afforded. And probably they in their turn became substantial citizens of the community,

                    ancestors came here in covered wagons or on horseback.</p>
            <p>It is fortunate that today dependent children are treated in a gentler fashion. Much progress has
                    been made since 1862 in the care of children as well as in the care of other dependent and
                    handicapped groups.</p>
            <p>The epochal event in the development of state and local care was the establishment in 1889 of the
                    Indiana Board of State Charities and Corrections. A serious defect in both the local and state
                    charitable and correctional system had been the absence of any comprehensive scheme of inspection
                    and supervision which would secure unbiased information as to the efficiency of the institutions and
                    the economy of their administration for the use of state officials and the public generally. Even in
                    local administration there was little central organization and less effective control. Such
                    inspections and investigations as were conducted by state and local institutions were hasty and
                    perfunctory.</p>
            <p>The importance of better control over all penal and benevolent agencies and the need for more
                    accurate statistical information were noted by governors of the state long before reforms were
                    instituted. The political patronage scandals of 1887 and 1889 focused popular attention upon the
                    question of management and discipline of the penal and benevolent institutions. The result was the
                    passage in 1889 of the act establishing the Board of State Charities.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> This act
                    was passed, in the words of the Attorney-General, Louis T. Michener, "to correct the abuses

            </p>
            <p>The Board was composed of the governor and six appointed members, three from each political party,
                    with the governor as president. It was to meet quarterly or oftener if necessary and to appoint a
                    salaried secretary. According to the act the Board was given the authority to investigate the whole
                    system of charitable and correctional institutions of the state and to examine their conditions. In
                    case of necessity the personnel in charge of the various institutions could be required to appear
                    before the Board, to produce papers, and to submit such information as seemed pertinent.
                    Furthermore, the Board could prescribe forms for reports and registration, and could also criticize
                    and suggest changes in the plans for the operation of jails and infirmaries. Each county was
                    required to present such plans to the Board before they could be adopted.</p>
            <p>The Board, however, did not have the power to correct abuses. Changes were made largely by calling to
                    the attention of state officials as well as the public undesirable conditions. The people had
                    confidence in the Board's recommendation. Among the results of the Board were non-partisan
                    administration of state institutions, regular supervision and inspection, uniform and high standards
                    of administration, business methods, and higher standards and more humane treatment of inmates. As
                    regards local administration, its work brought about a reduction in outdoor relief; improvements in
                    poor asylums, jails, and orphans' homes; reduction in the proportionate number of
                    dependents; homes found for dependent children; the regulation of child caring institutions,
                    associations, and maternity hospitals; and compulsory school attendance.</p>
            <p>Outstanding citizens were appointed to the Board. Of notable memory is Timothy Nicholson, a <placeName>

            <p>To bring about unity and understanding within the state among persons directly concerned with
                    charities and corrections, the Board inaugurated meetings of township trustees and county
                    commissioners. Out of these meetings grew the Indiana Conference of State Charities, which was
                    organized on an independent basis in 1893, and later changed its title to the Indiana State
                    Conference on Social Work. A combination of public interest and Board sponsorship brought into
                    existence the Indiana Mental Hygiene Society. These two organizations drew together representative
                    members from public and private agencies as well as lay members from the state who were interested
                    in charities, corrections, and mental hygiene. Both lay and professional members took an active part
                    and co-operated to promote their common interest. These organizations laid a good foundation for
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p>Upon the recommendation of the Board of State Charities, progressive legislation was passed. A study
                    was made of the methods and procedures in other states, particularly in institutions, and changes
                    and recommendations were made in Indiana on the basis of findings. Indiana became an example among
                    the states and a national leader in the fields of charities and corrections.</p>
            <p>Among the many improvements which took form under the Board of State Charities was the administration
                    of local poor relief. Prior to 1895 township trustees gave aid as they saw fit, with no supervision
                    of any kind. There were flagrant abuses with excessive expenditures in some places and actual
                    neglect of need in others. The law of 1897 required uniform practices of the township trustees in
                    the granting of relief. At this time township trustee aid was defined as temporary aid, and it was
                    stated that permanent charges should be removed to the county asylum. Policies were followed to
                    discourage dependency. Not until 1899 were modern methods of managing poor asylums prescribed. In
                    the county, as in state institutions, it was learned that supervision aided materially in the
                    efficient, humane, and economical administration of institutions. Under the reporting <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-045-4-072"/> system developed by the Board of State Charities both for township
                    relief and for county asylums care greatly improved.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the 1897 law, the State assumed direct supervision over work for children and prohibited the
                    retention of children between the ages of three and seventeen in almshouses for more than ten days.
                    The county commissioners were required to establish and maintain asylums for orphans, dependent,
                    neglected, or abandoned children; to enter into contracts with associations for the purpose to
                    establish and maintain asylums; and to place children in charge of a state agent for placement.
                    After the passage of this law, and as a result of a joint conference between the commissioners of
                    Henry and Rush counties, Mrs. Ella Bundy opened The Children's Home in <placeName>

                    </placeName> on May 1, 1905, and children were cared for in it under contract at three dollars per

                    average population fluctuating between twenty and thirty. After Mrs. Bundy's death,
                    however, the quality of the home's services deteriorated, and it was closed in 1914. The
                    children in it at the time were transferred to orphanages in <placeName>

            <p>This board, in the words of a contemporary, was to be the eyes and ears of the county and to make
                    inspections once each quarter. Both the county boards of charities and corrections and the county
                    boards of children's guardians served a real purpose.</p>
            <p>The twentieth century became more and more an industrialized society, with a great deal happening in
                    the general thinking of the public about social and economic problems. Poverty and dependency were
                    considered in terms of cause and prevention. Some related work was instituted in the field of
                    education and in the maintenance of public employment offices and public recreational facilities.
                    Whatever else might have developed in the normal course of events was cut across by the widespread
                    unemployment of the early 1930's. This happened so quickly that long-term programs were
                    discarded in order to meet immediate needs.</p>
            <p>About this time serious consideration was given to the premise that in this industrialized society
                    the cause of need may be far from local in origin. This trend in thinking, coupled with actual
                    inability of local taxing units to cope with the situation, brought about government intervention.
                    The first of a series of federal aids for local relief was effected through the Emergency Relief and
                    Construction Act of 1932, which made money available through the Reconstruction Finance
                        Corporation.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> This was followed by a great many types of federal help given
                    through W.P.A., C.W.A., F.E.R.A., and other alphabet agency programs which gave relief in various
                    forms, mainly through work. In 1933, Indiana established the Governor's Commmission on
                    Unemployment Relief to co-ordinate and assist the several agencies of the state engaged in relief of
                    the unemployed.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Later, as the federal emergency agencies became more active in
                    the relief field, the GCUR co-ordinated and cleared the use of federal funds in the state.</p>
            <p>Under an executive order of 1933 reorganizing the administrative form of the state government, the
                    title of the Board of State Charities was changed to the State Department of Public Welfare.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> In order that the work of this agency and the Governor's Commission

                    director and board, which continued until 1936 when the Public Welfare Act of Indiana was passed.</p>
            <p>While the emergency agencies were functioning, a feeling began to grow that the burden of caring for
                    dependents should be spread permanently to a partial federal base. The Social Security Act of 1935,
                    therefore, was passed to provide certain basic securities for the individual. Among its provisions
                    were grants to the states for public assistance and child welfare. The states, in order to be
                    eligible for securing such federal funds, had to pass legislation and set up machinery for
                    operation. Grants-in-aid for public welfare, just as for any other federally shared function,
                    allowed the federal government to impose standards upon state and local governments.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Indiana Public Welfare Act of 1936 was passed to make Indiana eligible to receive grants-in-aid
                    from the federal government for aid to the aged, the blind, and dependent children; for child
                    welfare services; and for services to crippled children.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> In addition to the
                    federally shared functions, Indiana public welfare was given responsibility for an eye-treatment
                    program for the blind and incipient blind and later a medical-aid program for recipients of public
                    assistance. To carry out the provisions of the Public Welfare Act, the General Assembly established
                    the State Department of Public Welfare to supervise, and a county department of public welfare in
                    each of the ninety-two counties to administer the program, thus retaining a certain amount of local
                    responsibility. Parole supervision, however, is under the jurisdiction of the State Department. In
                    addition, the duties and responsibilities formerly delegated to the Board of State Charities were
                    transferred to the State Department. These include inspections and investigations of state and
                    county institutions, the licensing of all children's institutions, child-placing agencies,
                    and boarding homes. A recent law has also authorized the State Department to license nursing homes.</p>

                    the exception of Moore who died in 1944. It was largely through his initiative that many old records
                    useful in verifying eligibility data became available to the county department, and his efforts did
                    much toward establishing the present welfare program as a part of the county's public

                    even to the present. An interesting article appeared in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> in 1870. "The county is swarming with a class of vagabonds known
                    as ‘tramps' who, during the summer season, strike out through the country, and
                    manage to steal and beg enough for subsistence. They generally make it a point to reach a farm house
                    just about dark, that hour being better suited to work on the sympathies of the inmates. When they
                    secure a night's lodgings they affect gratefulness and all that sort of thing, but unless
                    they are closely watched they leave early in the morning and carry away such articles as they can
                    turn into capital. True charity is commendable but help extended to roving characters like the above
                    is merely encouraging vagrancy, and making dead-beats of men who would otherwise strive to make an
                    honest living."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides showing at least partly the reason for the development of organized charities, this account
                    highlights a general problem. John Steinbeck's 1939 bestseller book, <hi rend="i">The
                        Grapes of Wrath</hi>, brought the migrant laborer to the attention of the public. With
                    today's fuller employment there is little of that type of problem, but there are still many
                    cases of dependency among nonsettled persons, and it is necessary to transfer dependents without
                    legal settlement back to their state of residency. This sometimes becomes a difficult task, with the
                    great variation in state laws on residence. Other functions in which residency effects procedure

                    mentally handicapped.</p>
            <p>Someone has made the statement that, "The twentieth century has seen many changes in social
                    customs. More and more clubs and societies have been founded and combine charitable work with social
                    activities." This is true, but the older social groups also maintained charitable
                    activities. Such activities become more apparent as one notes the structure and activities of
                    present social groups. And in passing, special mention should be made of the Rotarians, Kiwannis,
                    Lions, Xi Iota Psi, Tri Kappa, Legion posts, and all the other organizations whose work has filled
                    needs which lay outside the scope of the public agency and supplemented the services of public
                    agencies. These organizations have taken over to a large degree functions earlier conducted through
                    "good neighbor" services and compare with the "aid societies"
                    which gave help during the Civil War to needy soldiers' families.</p>
            <p>In considering human needs, attention has been given to those currently experienced and in proportion
                    to the feeling about them and the knowledge of ways of meeting them. The span of life was
                    comparatively short a century ago, and medicine was in its infancy. Infant mortality rates were high
                    and little was done to guard child life. In the war for health, the chief concern was with diseases
                    prevalent at the time like cholera and smallpox epidemics, malaria, and typhoid riding under the
                    guise of ague or chills and fever or "the shakes." But as the wilderness was
                    beaten back life became more comfortable, modern science developed, and human life became something
                    to protect. Efforts have been focused on previously considered chronic or terminal diseases, the
                    refinements of public health, and preventive medicine. Indiana has increasingly turned attention
                    during recent decades to sick and crippled children, of which Riley Hospital in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> stands as a living testimonial. The public welfare law makes services available to all
                    children who are crippled within the definition of the law and who may hope to benefit by treatment.</p>
            <p>A criticism of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName> home made around 1880 received the following reply from the county commissioners:
                    "It would never do to make the fare, the comforts, and the general attractiveness of the
                    asylum such that able- <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-045-4-077"/> bodied, but lazy, shiftless persons of
                    whom there are a few in every community, would seek for a residence in the county home."
                    Something of this same problem and the method of handling it exists in the modern public welfare
                    programs. There has always been a desire to give adequate and generous help to people who needed it.
                    But it was never the wish, either in early times or now to support at public expense the person able
                    to maintain himself or who has relatives capable of his support. Nor is it fair to the taxpayers to
                    provide aid to the dependent members of a community to such an extent as to enable them to maintain
                    a higher standard of living than their self-supporting neighbors. These are problems which are
                    inherent in any form of welfare work. The integrity of self-support must be maintained in a
                    democracy. At present the problem is met through the use of county standards of requirements by
                    which each county sets up its own standards based on community conditions and establishes the
                    necessary costs of each recipient's unmet needs against these standards. The total amount
                    of aid must be within statutory limitations. With the present costs of living, however, there is a
                    small possibility that in any county grants of forty-five dollars a month will exceed low level
                    living costs.</p>
            <p>Today there are more public services than ever before in history. The state and county departments of
                    public welfare are responsible for only one segment of the entire public services conducted for the
                    relief of dependents and handicapped persons. Public welfare is given the responsibility for the
                    needs of long-term dependents. Short-term or emergency needs are met through the township trustees.
                    The county home, no longer the dumping ground of earlier years, is still used for the homeless
                    dependent of the county. There are fewer able-bodied inmates in county homes today, and it is no
                    longer possible to maintain large farm plants with the aid of inmate help. The increased number of
                    chronically ill and infirm members of the community who need the care provided by the county home
                    brought about the new 1947 law which permits the aged who need assistance to receive emergency or
                    permanent care there, but self-supporting persons are required to purchase their own care.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Those county homes which meet <list type="footnotes">

                    groups. Hospitals and public health agencies are concerned with various phases of dependency

                    reformatory, to rehabilitative, and to preventive treatment. The earliest state prison in Indiana
                    was managed by the contract system which permitted exploitation of prison labor. Today the state
                    takes full responsibility for its prisoners as well as parole and other types of release procedures
                    to supplement penal treatment. The earlier custodial care of mental patients has given way to
                    curative treatment, and today preventive treatment is sponsored through mental hygiene clinics. The
                    dependent person of a century ago was the object of community comment. Now he is considered to have
                    "rights to relief," and his records are handled as a confidential matter. Aid is
                    given wherever and in whatever form needed, but basic to all relief is rehabilitation toward
                    self-support. Hand in hand with rehabilitation by using psychology, medicine, and all the other
                    skills of the modern age, the trend is toward prevention of handicap and dependency. Public health,
                    education, and welfare are particular fields in which people work together toward these ends. But
                    even more basic to the prevention of dependency and delinquency are community and family strains
                    which are inherited and pass on from one generation to another.</p>

                    September in 1831. Isaac F. Wade, who owned the equipment, was the first publisher of the paper. He
                    planned to issue the first copy about the first or second week of September, but when the cases of
                    type, which had been sent directly from the foundry, were opened, it was discovered that there was
                    no capital "D" in the long primer type. Wade was a Whig in politics and said that

                    charge of publication on June 11, 1836. The issue of June 25, 1836, shows a change in publishers
                    when Ambrose Harland bought Snyder's part of the business. This change did not remain in
                    effect very long, for the issue of June 17, 1837, shows that Snyder was back at his old job and
                    Harland's name does not appear in that issue. Jere Keeney in his article on early printing

            <p>In another article entitled "The Whig and the Republican Press," Keeney stated that

                    By August 7, 1875, John L. Miller had become the sole owner of the paper. He was assisted by W. H.
                    Faust with the mechanical help necessary in the printing of the paper. By October 22, 1881, the
                    paper had changed hands again with James B. Seller, John E. Hanna, and E. M. Henkel in charge.
                    Henkel retired in April of the following year, and Seller sold his part of the business to Hanna by

                    October 17, 1885, Hanna and Company sold the business to Fleming T. Luse, who became the editor; and
                    Clarence E. Galey, who became the business manager. W. E. Henkel became the new business manager on
                    February 15, 1890, and was followed by W. D. Harlow on August 15, 1893. On October 23, 1897, Henkel

                    The paper was published with apparent financial success until 1848 when because of bad editorial

                    Keeney. In August, 1856, they sold the paper to J. A. Gilkey and D. N. Cantrill. The next publisher,
                    W. H. Faust, with J. A. Gilkey as editor and proprietor, obtained the paper in October of the same
                    year. Sometime after Fry and Keeney sold the paper to Gilkey and Cantrill, the name was changed to

                    months. About the middle of April, 1868, T.H.B. McCain and J. H. Hendricks purchased the newspaper.
                    On November 5, 1868, Hendricks sold his interest in the business to John T. Talbot. McCain and
                    Talbot published the paper until April 9, 1874. Two weeks later, however, they printed a new paper

            <p>There were many publications sponsored directly by Wabash College or indirectly through the different
                    societies and classes, which were published before 1900. Some of these publications contain imprints

            <p>A short sketch of other newspapers in the county may be of interest. The first newspaper published in
                    Darlington, Indiana, of which there is any record was the <hi rend="i">Dispatch</hi>, established in
                    April, 1886, under the management of Charles W. Powell. In 1887 it was sold to Thomas V. Maxedon.
                    After two years it ceased publication but was resumed about 1891 when it was purchased by William
                    Pittman. At that time the name was changed to <hi rend="i">The Echo</hi>. It continued under this
                    title until 1916. Several years after Pittman had obtained the paper, he left Darlington, and it was
                    published by E. K. Burkett of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. Other owners since that time were O. H. Greist, first principal of the Darlington High
                    School; A. R. Peterson; Ernest Leachman; A. H. Shawber; Gertrude Cook; and Charles A. Marshall. When
                    Marshall bought the paper he changed the name to the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>.</p>
            <p>A group of Darlington businessmen launched the <hi rend="i">News</hi> in 1907, and the first year it
                    was published by Homer and Rua Miller. Miller and his sister sold the paper to Charles and Edith
                    Marshall, who later sold it to Walter Honecker. R. F. Mix of Elnora purchased the <hi rend="i">News</hi> in 1911 and changed its name to the <hi rend="i">Record</hi>. He published the paper for
                    four years and then moved back to Elnora.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    <hi rend="i">Ruralist</hi> was the first newspaper issued in that town on April 20, 1860, with D. A.
                    Burton as the editor and publisher. In 1872 William Boswell established the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>. It was purchased by T. B. Bell and Milton Scott, who conducted it for
                    about a year and sold it to John Harney. C. Kinder then took over and, in 1878, changed the name of
                    the paper to the <placeName>

                    <p>A friend of ours had a farm in Indiana. Papa looked at it and found there very nice people and
                        beautiful farms. In the meantime Karl's father died and we inherited quite a bit. Karl
                        bought eighty acres of land at Vienna, Indiana,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> one and a half miles from
                        the railroad station. The house stood in the middle of the farm. No neighbor house was to be
                        seen. In the spring [1855] we moved in with our three boys. Papa carried Albert, I carried
                        Eduard, and Willie toddled alongside. Our furniture came on the same day and was moved by a
                        neighbor. Our dwelling was a double blockhouse. Several rows of fruit trees and fourteen big
                        evergreens formed an enclosure around the house. We also had a large barn with a threshing floor
                        and hayloft.</p>

                    <p>Now the work began. Sixty acres were cleared land and the remaining twenty were in woods. Papa
                        got the plow and harrow ready. We had two horses and two cows, hogs, four sheep, and chickens.
                        The fresh air and milk did us all good. Papa soon looked better and little Albert began to put
                        on weight. Everything proceeded as well as we could wish. Only the horses did not work properly
                        together as yet.</p>
                    <p>On Sundays our German neighbors visited us. The nearest was Mr. F. Kiederle from Ulm, son of a
                        very esteemed family. His wife was from Stuttgart. They were a newly wedded, droll couple. Their
                        house consisted only of a room and a small kitchen. From Mrs. Kiederle I could get no advice,
                        and I was so anxious to learn. But to the other neighbor, Mrs. McCullough, I owe all my
                        knowledge and skill. She taught me to shear sheep, dye wool, spin, etc. All that went well and
                        already the next winter I had my own yarn for knitting. Later I had enough wool to have our
                        clothes woven and I paid for the weaving with a third of the yarn.</p>
                    <p>The second nearest neighbors were the Rueff family, also from Stuttgart. Then came Mr.
                        Dinkelacker, whose farm was nearer to Henryville, Indiana, and seven to eight miles distant from
                        us. All these people were likewise book farmers,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> but they were nice
                        charming folk, and especially was Mrs. Dinkelacker a very dear friend to me. We did not care
                        about the other settlers. During the long winter evenings I sewed; Papa sat half the night
                        through and read to me. It was so nice and cosy. Had we only had better light, we knew nothing
                        of petroleum and gas. Our harvest did not yield much the first year, but we did butcher two
                        hogs. What a celebration that was for us!</p>
                    <p>It is hard to form a good idea of what work on a farm actually means. The man has to cultivate
                        the land and tend the cattle, whereas the woman must make butter, raise chickens, peel and dry
                        fruit, spin, sew, wash, iron, etc. It was also up to me to exchange butter, eggs, chickens, and
                        so forth for coffee, sugar, shoes, in short, for everything which we needed and did not have
                        ourselves. However, we received little for our produce. When prices were high we had nothing to
                        sell. Because we didn't have a cellar for the milk, we could not make butter and cheese
                        during winter, when prices improved. Instead I sold dried apples, occasionally also peaches.
                        Several children I instructed in crochet work, who paid me with eggs and the like.</p>

                            highly educated Germans who fled during the second quarter of the last
                            century—the Tafels emigrated after the Revolution of 1848—and because
                            of their idealism and intense desire for freedom and independence turned to farming. They
                            were the city farmers of a century ago. They knew Latin, but they frequently did not know
                            how to make a livelihood with their hands. Therefore the epithet. Many were complete
                            failures, some actually perished. Mrs. Tafel gives here a rare firsthand account of these
                            settlers, although histories of the German element in the United States regularly mention
                            them. See Rudolf Cronau, <hi rend="i">Drei Jahrhunderte deutschen Lebens in Amerika</hi>

                    <p>On the third of January, 1858, our Theodor was born. We had no female help in the house. Papa
                        could not get any for money or good words. I had a big kettle full of fat standing by the
                        chimney fire when the doctor came. He helped Papa carry it out. The weather was frightfully
                        cold. I can still see the doctor, how clumsy he acted when he washed the infant. The following
                        morning a near-by neighbor, Mrs. Wilke, came who looked after the little fellow better and
                        brought me something to eat. She came daily for a whole week through and also took care of my
                        washing. From then on I got along by myself, with Papa's help, as well as I could. Oh,
                        how would I have endured it if our dear Papa hadn't been so good to me. He helped me
                        everywhere, nothing was too much for him. I was at that time very poorly and weak and could not
                        nurse the baby myself. That made everything more difficult.</p>
                    <p>Little Theodor, however, was a robust child. Albert and Eduard were growing stronger too, so that
                        in the spring I was able to undertake a trip to Rueffs on horseback with the three children.
                        Albert sat behind, I had Eduard and Theodor on my lap. However, I had to keep talking to Albert
                        all the time, so that he would not fall asleep and slip off. Willie had to stay with Papa.</p>
                    <p>In such a manner I managed to arrive at the Rueffs once again, when Mrs. Rueff called out to me:
                        "Just turn right around, you have visitors yourself." She was right. At home I
                        met Mr. Beckman, Dr. Hupfauf,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> and Prof. Ernst from <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                        </placeName>. Stiff from riding I got down from the horse. I offered the gentlemen pancakes with
                        excellent head lettuce and coffee. It tasted so wonderful to them that I had to serve a second
                        helping. Later on they often came out to hunt rabbits.</p>
                    <p>In order to earn money, Papa made railroad crossties in winter, which he would haul to the
                        station during the summer.</p>
                    <p>On the 22nd of February, 1860, twins were born to us. At noon on the day before I had the good
                        fortune at least to get Baeble, an old Swiss maid of seventy years. Baeble was the sole help of
                        all in such need. For ten miles around she was among young married people the only one of her
                        kind, so that frequently a person was in a dilemma where to get help, if the time figured out
                        was not right. This time I had double luck. The babies came so fast, that Papa did not have time
                        to fetch the doctor. In his excitement Papa pushed the light off the table. When he wanted to
                        pick it up he fainted. Baeble began to chide. It would be better if he brought his horse into
                        the stable, she said, otherwise it would freeze to death. (It was standing in the open ready to
                        fetch the doctor). He should be ashamed of himself to swoon away, she continued on and on. And
                        then the babies were born without any light other than with the light of the fireplace. How I
                        cried when Papa said: "Well, now we have six boys. Oh, Wife, how I feel sorry for
                        you!" But I did not want to be pitied, as long as my good <list type="footnotes">

                        <pb n="416" id="VAA4025-045-4-094"/> man was so kind and healthy. The neighbor women came to
                        visit me. I could not stand their gossip and began to talk out of my head. Then Papa sent them
                        all away.</p>
                    <p>In the same night dogs dug a hole under our smokehouse and ate and spoiled much meat. Papa laid
                        poison, and I believe three dogs died from it. That aroused angry feelings among the neighbors.
                        Papa got out of the affair by saying that it had been rat poison. The people did not hold it
                        against him long either, for they needed him too much in times of sickness. He was a trained
                        apothecary.</p>
                    <p>Willie and Albert went on horseback to our friends the next day to bring them the news of the
                        birth of our babies. After they were well on their way, it began to storm. It grew dark and
                        still the boys did not come home. Out of fear the minutes seemed like hours to me.
                        "Gee-haw!" that was their voices. They returned after sundown. What all they
                        had to tell! So many trees had almost fallen on them. One time their horse had to make a long
                        jump to miss one. They said that Mr. Dinkelacker wanted to keep them overnight or bring them
                        home himself, etc., etc. Right away on the next day Mr. Dinkelacker came to see whether the
                        children had come home safely.</p>
                    <p>Baeble was able to stay with us only seven days. I had, of course, not as yet regained my
                        strength, but I dragged myself into the kitchen anyhow. Baeble, the good soul, was making dough
                        to bake bread for us before her departure. She was just spitting into her hands in order to wipe
                        the hair out of her face for the sake of cleanliness and then stuck them into the flour. Prosit
                        and a blessed appetite! This fresh bread would surely not have agreed with me, and so I
                        preferred to continue eating Karl's cornbread. My friends, however, soon brought me
                        sufficient bread.</p>
                    <p>Papa went out to plow. No sooner was Baeble away than the little ones began to scream. My heart
                        wanted to break, and I cried with them, because I could not do anything for them. Fortunately,
                        Papa came. When he noticed Baeble take leave, he wanted to look after me. He warmed the milk and
                        the beds for the twins and comforted me. And then everything was fine again.</p>
                    <p>What a difference between the twins! The world did not seem to suit Richard, the first-born. He
                        cried all the time, while blond Hermann was always satisfied as long as he could suck his thumb.
                        At five months of age Richard had five teeth already, while Hermann had to wait fifteen months
                        for his first one. Thus there remained a big difference between both boys to this day.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>Spring led us back into our old habits. My sister-in-law Bertha visited us again with her two
                        girls and remained for some time. Her visit brought me help and a change, but I could sleep so
                        little.</p>
                    <p>We now had five cows and that increased our work. Papa milked the cows very early in the morning
                        and I took care of that in the evening. Because the cows ran around wild in the woods, they
                        always had to be brought in of an evening, which was the work of the children. One time they
                        went away early for this purpose. The cows came <list type="footnotes">

                        <pb n="417" id="VAA4025-045-4-095"/> rather late, but without the boys. We waited and waited
                        till nine o'clock. In a terrible state of alarm I wanted to go out and look for the
                        children, for we were used to going to bed with the chickens. Suddenly we discovered them
                        sleeping on their bed. Instead of scolding them in our first excitement, we caressed them, happy
                        to have them back again. After all, they were so tired.</p>
                    <p>Our harvest was a good one. Willie, who was only seven years old, was sent during late fall with
                        wheat or corn to the mill. A full sack was laid across the horse's back and he was set
                        on top, so that it would not slip off. He was usually gone the whole day, but never came home
                        without flour. Karl treated the family of the miller in times of sickness, therefore the
                        advantage over other customers.</p>
                    <p>In the winter of 1861, Willie and Albert went to school which lasted only three months. One day
                        Willie went all alone and on the way he had to cross a little stream. A tree trunk had been laid
                        across the water and this he had to step over. He fell into the creek and lost his dinner
                        bucket. He got out fast enough, but not his bucket. He cried loudly and when people came all
                        that he could say was "my bucket." They, however, understood him to say
                        "my brother" and jumped into the water. Finally the bucket was found. Only
                        then did they understand what he had meant. The children, of course, knew no English. Then the
                        people got mad at the "Dutchman." However, they laughed about the incident
                        when they met Papa.</p>
                    <p>The children wore neither underwear nor overcoats and had to walk the long distance to school
                        daily in storm and rain. They were, however, always healthy and strong. Very often the
                        schoolroom was not heated on account of a lack of split wood.</p>
                    <p>Papa finally gave in to the petition of his friend Scheffer, who was apothecary in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                        </placeName>, and accepted from him a position during the winter as clerk in the drugstore. Mr.
                        Scheffer, namely, had taken his two boys to school in Stuttgart. I was glad to let Papa go, for
                        through this opportunity he earned some money. With it we were able to buy a new stove and
                        replace the horse which had died. Every fourteen days he came home over Sunday.</p>
                    <p>The Kiederles on the one side and the McCulloughs on the other side of us were good neighbors,
                        only we could not ask anything of them, for each family had enough troubles of their own. Mrs.
                        Kiederle was everything but a housewife. She had a girl two years old. Every Christmas she
                        received a box from home with presents, clothes, and such necessary and unnecessary things for
                        the family. Over this she was not any too happy, for she had to provide place for all these
                        things in her small house, a larger and a real small room. A dresser or something similar she
                        did not have, and so one box was put on top of the other. Often for the sake of convenience they
                        were left standing on the floor, so that it was scarcely possible to walk between them. In the
                        midst of disorder she was often to be found writing letters in the German, French, or English
                        language.</p>
                    <p>Secretly I envied this woman for all her wonderful things. In order to protect the young
                        vegetable plants from frost she often covered them with the most beautiful damask table cloth or
                        linen bed <pb n="418" id="VAA4025-045-4-096"/> sheets, once even with a red silk coat trimmed
                        with sable fur which just happened to be hanging there. The next morning she simply pushed aside
                        the whole affair with her foot.</p>
                    <p>At first the Kiederles bought everything on a large scale: 1 sack of rice, 1 bag of coffee, 50
                        pounds of tea, likewise sugar and medicines for man and beast. However, when worms got into the
                        rice, it was fed to the chickens. That, after all, didn't matter, but the coffee was
                        half burned at roasting and when there was no more tea, they simply boiled senna leaves of
                        which, of course, they still possessed so much. They had brought along three cases of shoe
                        polish; after three years they were still on the window sill, where they had been put at first.</p>
                    <p>As to peace of mind we could learn much from her. Hanging over the cradle she had three
                        bracelets, several rings and a watch tied together with a ribbon in order to amuse the baby.</p>
                    <p>The house door could not be shut tight. They often went away for days at a time. We talked them
                        into fixing the door so that it could be locked, which finally also happened. One Sunday they
                        were visiting us. Late in the evening Mr. Kiederle returned to look for the key to his house.
                        But it was not to be found. They had to break in the door. When they went to bed the key fell
                        out of his boot. After that the door was not repaired.</p>
                    <p>She once gave her husband twelve silver spoons to take to town for which he should buy her a
                        wardrobe. On his way back from Vienna he stopped at our house and instead of the wardrobe he had
                        a children's chair on his shoulder. With the rest of the money he had bought sample
                        seeds with which, however, he had no success.</p>
                    <p>At another time she threw out with the dish water a couple of silver spoons to the hogs which ran
                        away with them into the woods. In spite of all searching they could not be found. Then she said:
                        "Well, now I can have only ten children instead of twelve."</p>
                    <p>The poor woman died in Herman, <placeName>

                        </placeName>, giving birth to her ninth child. She was a very good woman. She had brought her
                        oldest daughter, 10 years of age, to school in Stuttgart. This journey she made with three
                        children, of which the youngest was three months old. She took along only three diapers and
                        returned again in soundness of health and good spirits. Only Mrs. Kiederle could do that!</p>
                    <p>In the year 1861, when Papa was with Mr. Scheffer, the war broke out. They wanted to draft him
                        too; but as apothecary he did not have to go. The history of the war you certainly know better
                        than I do. I only recall that the enthusiasm was great and that my brothers Louis, Theodor, and
                        Fritz marched off.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Louis and Theodor, both married, were lieutenants under

                        barley instead of coffee, but this did not seem to agree with me in the long run. My system
                        rebelled against it. I became miserable, wretched and weak. One day our friends Dr. Hupfauf, Mr.
                        Beckmann, and Dr. Ross visited us. Dr. Hupfauf was of the opinion that I should by all means
                        have better food. That was easily said, but where in these times should I get it? Then one day
                        two boxes full of wine, coffee, sugar, cheese, etc. were delivered at our house. Up on top lay a
                        big sheet of paper with the following note: "Please don't tell anybody, for
                        the Mrs. only. Dr. H.B.R." And behold, after a short time I grew stronger. That was
                        certainly wonderful.</p>
                    <p>Before the twins were two years old, one of them Hermann, suddenly got real sick with a high
                        fever. Now what? Since Karl had no faith in the Vienna doctor, I decided to go with the child to <placeName>

                        </placeName>. I saddled my horse in the evening in order to ask Mr. Dinkle-lacker to ride to
                        Baeble and bring her my horse so that she could ride to the children in the morning. Willie
                        played father,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> and thus I left the children alone over night with little
                        Richard. Mr. Dinkelacker brought me to the railway station at Henryville. I thought only of the
                        deadly sick child in my arms. At two o'clock at night I arrived in front of
                        Papa's store. He didn't believe his ears when he heard my voice. He found
                        Hermann very ill and fetched Dr. von Donhoff<hi rend="sup">8</hi> who laid the child in hot
                        compresses and diagnosed the illness as pneumonia. In the morning they brought me to Mrs. Halle,
                        wife of an apothecary, who had once visited us on the farm, with whom I had to stay ten days.</p>
                    <p>On a glorious Sunday morning I was allowed to return home again. A Mr. Alfred Hoffeld, clerk at
                        Mr. Scheffer's went with me. It had been arranged with Dinkelackers that I should come
                        to them by way of Henryville. He wanted to bring me home on horseback. In Henryville we got a
                        wagon right away to our friends. Mr. Dinkel-acker was soon ready, for I was impatient to get to
                        my children. It was about eleven o'clock when I opened the door to my house. What a
                        sight for me to behold! On each side of the fireplace stood a bed; on each bed stood two
                        children bombarding each other with pillows before a big fire. Richard sat in the middle of the
                        room and was enjoying the sport excellently, but when he saw me he began to cry. I asked:
                        "Where is Baeble?" "Oh she," they said, "she stayed
                        only one night and a day. She wanted to take us out to the field to husk corn. That we would not
                        do, so she got mad and left us!"</p>
                    <p>Thus the children had been left alone for eight days and had to do all the work. Willie milked
                        the cows as well as he could. They fed the hogs, the horses, and the chickens. When the baby was

                        fried bacon. The fireplace lay full of ashes up to the floor. In the coffee pot were the grounds
                        from the first day. The dishes had never been washed. And yet all went well. The children must
                        have had a special guardian angel. The Dinkelackers, as well as the Kiederles and Rueffs
                        criticized themselves for not having looked after the children. But the latter did not even know
                        that I had gone away. Furthermore, no one knew that Baeble had acted so stupidly.</p>

                        attend to the food. Fortunately, I had brought along coffee and such things. About two

            <p>The real nature of war is soon forgotten—if, indeed, it is ever apprehended—by
                    those not directly involved in it. Historians, however able and conscientious, cannot put its,
                    personal essence on paper. The hundreds of thousands of pages already published on the history of
                    the Second World War and the hundreds of thousands which may yet be devoted to it cannot easily
                    record what it meant to the individual caught in its midst. We have brilliant studies of military
                    and naval strategy, of diplomatic counterpoint, of political upheavals and debacles, of economic and
                    social changes, achievements, and catastrophes. These, however, are by their nature generalizations.
                    Even if they describe individual episodes, they usually involve masses of persons whose separate
                    identities are lost. Such is the inevitable limitation of the historian. In events which may have
                    had no generalized significance at the time to most of the participants, he must seek a pattern and
                    a meaning. Separated in time and space from these events, the reader cannot learn from most
                    histories, however excellent, how it felt to stand watch on deck in the freezing spray of an Arctic
                    night on the Murmansk run; or to carry a forty-five pound pack up a rough mountain trail in the New
                    Guinea jungle, over roots and fallen logs and across waist-deep streams, amidst swarming flies and
                    spiders "big enough to saddle and ride"; or to soak in an Italian foxhole for
                    weeks under grey skies, without dry clothes, living on cold K-rations, suffering from diarrhea, and
                    seeing one's buddies blown to bits in hours-long artillery barrages; or even to accustom
                    oneself to the dreary barracks life, the deadening physical exhaustion, the subordination to
                    loud-mouthed tryants, and the utter loss of individual dignity which was called basic training.</p>
            <p>What the historian has not been able to do, the novelist has attempted. A Norman Mailer or a John
                    Horne Burns can recreate the feelings and experiences of individuals with <pb n="422" id="VAA4025-045-4-100"/> compelling power. Nevertheless—however we may be moved by
                    the artistry of such a re-creation—we know in the back of our minds that we are reading
                    fiction. This, we tell ourselves, is <hi rend="i">like</hi> what happened to a lot of people, but it
                    isn't exactly what <hi rend="i">did</hi> happen to any real person.</p>
            <p>Now at last the gap between personal experiences and historical record has been bridged. It is a
                    great service by the Indiana War History Commission that the first volume actually published (though
                    the second numerically) in its history of Indiana during the Second World War is a volume of <hi rend="i">Letters from Fighting Hoosiers</hi> which tells us, in their own words, in a highly
                    personal way, how more than a hundred representative men and women of Indiana fared and felt during
                    the course of the war. The editors have selected 131 letters from more than thirty-five hundred made
                    available to them. Except for two articles by Ernie Pyle and a couple of other accounts written some
                    time after the events, the contributions are genuine letters to family or friends, not intended for
                    publication. Some, indeed, from men killed in battle, are so very personal that one realizes what a
                    sacrifice of privacy in grief has been made by the survivors in surrendering them to print.</p>
            <p>Literary merit, the editors say, was not the sole criterion in selection: sincerity and
                    representative distribution were important. Every branch of service is represented, including WACS,
                    WAVES, and the Red Cross; nearly every rank from private to general; every theater of war; and the
                    entire period of the struggle from Pearl Harbor to the months following V-J Day.</p>
            <p>These letters are the authentic voice of the American civilian in uniform. Some of the writers are
                    masters of the telling phrase, and some are addicted to the cliche. Some voice prejudices which the
                    war did not wear away, and some reveal great insight. Here you can find some Americans in foreign
                    lands indulging in a complacent feeling of national superiority, some making bitter and unfair
                    generalizations about other peoples on the basis of limited personal experience, some expressing
                    warm admiration for the qualities of our allies, and some showing keen interest in and shrewd
                    appraisal of the strange societies into which they have fought their way.</p>
            <p>Despite these differences of personality, temperament, outlook, and education, a certain community of
                    experience <pb n="423" id="VAA4025-045-4-101"/> emerges. War is the ultimate in horror, and the
                    military way of life is a bad way of life. These letters build up a picture of war, piece by piece,
                    until the total effect is almost unbearable. Here you have the boredom, the drab cheer-lessness of
                    barracks, the resentment of the new soldier—and of the seasoned one, too, often
                    enough—against arbitrary, unreasonable, and sometimes incompetent non-coms and officers;
                    the depressing grind of sixteen-hour KP; the idiocy of "inspection," and the
                    tragedy of a stray grain of dust discovered by an officer's white glove; the blistered
                    feet, the dusty roads, the hot uniforms under a blazing sun; the everlasting
                    "shots" for tetanus, typhoid, and other possible ailments; the
                    "slop" served as food on overcrowded British transports; the seasickness aboard a
                    tossing landing craft as you approach an enemy beach; the blisters that form on the hands on the
                    first day of digging foxholes and break on the second day and bleed on the third day; the long
                    artillery barrages during which you hug the stony ground or lie in a water-filled hole while your
                    friends are blasted into unrecognizable messes; the endless rain that soaks your clothes, which dry
                    out a little from your body-warmth at night if you can find a sheltered place to sleep, but get
                    soaked again the next morning; the helplessness under the strafing of enemy planes; the numbing
                    hours of guard duty at a frigid post; the fatalism that makes a flier starting off on a mission
                    wonder whether his "number" is up this time; the tension with which infantrymen
                    watch one of their fliers, his parachute caught on the tail of a burning plane, struggle to get it
                    loose until the flame sweeps across the cords and he plummets through space; the all-pervasiveness
                    of mud; the K-rations, the D-rations, the dehydrated eggs, the grey dehydrated potatoes with their
                    curious taste of corruption, the Spam, the Spam, the Spam!</p>
            <p>Here, of course, you also have perseverance, amazing courage, gaiety, the ability to find wry humor
                    in the grimmest situation, the tenderness which finds an object in the company pup, more spoiled
                    than a colonel's mistress at the Hotel Aletti. Yet all the qualities which held our men
                    together and brought them—or the survivors—victory cannot make us forget the
                    unspeakable grimness of war. One of the most painfully realistic battle accounts I have ever read is
                    in this book: the simple story of a man caught with a few comrades in a small town during the Battle
                    of the <pb n="424" id="VAA4025-045-4-102"/> Bulge. His straightforward narrative is replete with
                    horrible details:</p>
            <p>"Two of the boys were still there, blown to Kingdom Come by an 88. I looked at them, but
                    didn't recognize either one. Tupper told me who they were. I still couldn't
                    recognize them. … I remember one rifle which had part of a man's forearm blown
                    into the stock. … The pig went a little farther and started munching on a German body.
                    … We went to sleep [in a basement] immediately and were awakened by Tupper who told us
                    before we were fully awake that we were going out and dig in in front of the town. I chocked back
                    some tears and told him this was suicide, but the officers were back in the town now and they wanted
                    a place to sleep. The basement we were in looked pretty good to them and they started gloating over
                    it before we were out."</p>
            <p>There is nothing specifically Hoosier about this book. It is a book about Americans, who might have
                    come from any state in the Union. They faced death, and some of them met death, with a courage which
                    knows no boundary. Every American should read them at least once a year, and should spend some time
                    contemplating the frontispiece, a superb photograph of a G. I. who combines the utter weariness of a
                    Bill Mauldin figure with the tragic dignity of a Rembrandt portrait. The book should be read, and
                    the portrait studied, with special intensity and prayerfulness by those persons who prate with
                    callous ease or even satisfaction about "the next war."</p>

            <p>This volume is, as its title suggests, a collection of documents which purport to illustrate the
                    first century of the history of Cahokia. The reason for its appearance is the desire "to
                    focus attention on Cahokia in commemoration of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its
                    founding." To attain this end, five different writers edited various <pb n="425" id="VAA4025-045-4-103"/> sections of the documents, while an introductory chapter by the editor
                    himself is devoted to a sketch of Cahokia and its people. In the body of the book, Joseph P.
                    Donnelly, S.J., treats material relating to the founding and history of the Holy Family Mission, the
                    church burial records from 1784 to 1794, and letters from Monk's Mound,
                    1809–1812; the section on life in Cahokia as illustrated by legal documents,
                    1772–1821, is the work of Rose Josephine Boylan; the balance of the book includes the
                    letters of Charles Gratiot, 1778–1779, edited by Brenda R. Gieseker; documents on Fort
                    Bowman, 1778–1780, Charles van Ravenswaay; and two nineteenth century law cases, Irving
                    Dilliard.</p>
            <p>The book is open to some criticism on several points. In the first place, it is marred by far, far
                    too many typographical errors, a shortcoming which arouses a sense of caution—perhaps
                    unwarranted—toward acceptance of the accuracy of the contents as a whole. Then, too, the
                    table of contents would be more useful if it were completely paged; and a more sharp distinction
                    between the text and the long quotations, particularly in the first chapter, would have been helpful
                    to the reader. As far as subject matter is concerned, the scholarship is uneven, for some sections
                    are edited with excessive minuteness, while others leave unexplained questionable points.
                    Furthermore some historians would have been happier had the French been included whenever a document
                    was originally written in that language. Finally, the material on Monk's Mound dates a
                    decade and more after the end of Cahokia's first century, while no really good reason is
                    given for this departure from self-imposed time limits.</p>
            <p>The value of the documents will necessarily vary with the needs of the person consulting them. Anyone
                    who plans to write a detailed history of Cahokia will of course find them indispensable. The
                    material edited by the Reverend Mr. Donnelly will appeal to those who are interested in
                    ecclesiastical history, while people attracted to social aspects will like Miss Boylan's
                    section. Military and economic historians might be able to use the documents on Fort Bowman as well
                    as the Gratiot letters, the correspondence of a trader at Cahokia during the American invasion. A
                    writer interested in an overall picture of the transition from French to American domination will
                    find material scattered throughout the book. In general, the documents add little of importance <pb n="426" id="VAA4025-045-4-104"/> to historical knowledge. Aside from their inherent interest and
                    the special uses pointed out above, perhaps the chief contributions of the book lie in its addition
                    to the total store of printed documents available to the historian and in the fact that it contains
                    in compact form Cahokian documents held in widely separated locations.</p>

            <p>The publication of this brochure marks the initial step in disseminating to the public a knowledge of
                    the rich special collections of the Indiana University Library. The proposed series, supervised by
                    Robert A. Miller and Cecil K. Byrd, is "designed to make better known to students the
                    source materials in the Library." The core of this pamphlet is a letter written by Jonathan
                    Williams, Benjamin Franklin's great-nephew, describing the debate in the House of Lords,
                    January 20, 1775, in which William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, proposed "that immediate orders
                    may be dispatched to General Gage for removing His Majestys Forces from the Town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>." In his introduction Bernhard Knollenberg describes the background of this
                    "crucial moment in British and American history" particularly as it relates to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Chatham.</p>
            <p>The letter is of interest to Anglo-American historians as a supplement to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "Account of Negotiations in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>" and as a capable report of the debate in which Chatham played the leading
                    role. Dr. Knollenberg's assertion that it is "superior in terseness and
                    vivacity" to the reports of Josiah Quincy, Jr., and Hugh Boyd is not necessarily proof of
                    its accuracy. The manuscript serves rather to strengthen the phraseology of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s report by linking it more closely with Boyd's thus lending more
                    authority to Chatham's comments on the Continental Congress and supplementing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s version of the opening sentences which Boyd missed. At the same time it
                    corroborates portions of the version printed by George Kearsley (<hi rend="i">The speech of the
                        right honourable the Earl of Chatham</hi>) which was withdrawn <pb n="427" id="VAA4025-045-4-105"/> at that speaker's request. Correlation and comparison of these
                    and several other extant reports will be of value in clarifying not only Chatham's
                    statements, but those of succeeding speakers in the debate.</p>
            <p>Dr. Knollenberg's introduction suffers in that he did not see fit to consider the problem in
                    the light of English politics. The significance of Chatham's actions should be read with an
                    eye to Horace Walpole's jibe of "ridiculous" and Edmund Burke's
                    judgment that "more would have been in the minority, if Lord Chatham had thought proper to
                    give notice of his motion to the proper people." The division on the motion is given as
                    18–77, an error possibly derived from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName> report. Similarly, the editor has retained the manuscript spelling of
                    "Shelden" for John Selden. A misplaced emphasis upon the danger in reporting
                    parliamentary debates is based upon references which do not apply to the period under discussion,
                    and in any case ignores the actual conditions in 1775.</p>
            <p>These minor flaws hardly detract from the interest and contribution of the manuscript here offered to
                    the academic world. With a wide variety of material to draw upon, further "Indiana
                    University Library Publications" will be awaited with anticipation.</p>

            <p>The author of the first volume of this ten-volume history of the South is a native Southerner, a

                    understanding the author's viewpoint. "To write <pb n="428" id="VAA4025-045-4-106"/> of the South when there was no South is a task not without difficulties. The men and women whose
                    story is recounted in the following pages were not Southerners; in fact, they did not think of
                    themselves even as Americans. They were Europeans and, for the most part, Englishmen."</p>
            <p>In the opening chapter, Craven points out that the Spanish were the pioneers who found the Southern
                    route across the Atlantic and whose occupation of the West Indies and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> established methods and techniques which others must follow to be successful in the New
                    World.</p>
            <p>Considerable emphasis is placed by the author upon the work of the elder Hakluyt in his
                    "Notes" on colonization as influencing the activities of the English throughout
                    the period. The younger Hakluyt is credited with having kept alive among Englishmen an interest in
                    the New World in the late years of the sixteenth century. In the founding of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, there were close connections with her sister colony of Bermuda. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> Company tried repeatedly to further the interests of its colony. It permitted the
                    establishment of a representative assembly and adopted an extensive economic program both of which
                    are closely associated with the name of Edwin Sandys. During the interregnum the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> assembly secured the power of the purse, while the development of local government gave
                    much influence to the leading planters in the county court and in the House of Burgesses.</p>
            <p>Although "the <placeName>

                    </placeName> charter entrusted to Lord Baltimore prerogatives that had been denied any one for
                    approximately a century," he prepared "a very fertile field indeed for the growth
                    of a political tradition emphasizing individual liberty."</p>
            <p>The founding of Carolina was closely associated with the desire of the English government to
                    diversify the products of the empire. The Fundamental Constitutions, although unsuited to America
                    included the ideas of practical political leaders of Seventeenth Century England.</p>
            <p>Bacon's Rebellion is presented as due to disregard of the problems of the people of the
                    backcountry particularly in matters of defense against the Indians, to the special privileges of the
                    ruling class, and to the impetuosity of Nathaniel Bacon. The strengthening of imperial and
                    proprietary controls and the unsolved Indian problem caused <pb n="429" id="VAA4025-045-4-107"/>
                    much discontent which extended to the other colonies and which prepared the way for the revolution
                    of 1689.</p>
            <p>The author does not neglect the influences of the American surroundings upon the colonists, but
                    balances them skillfully with English origins and heritages. The office of sheriff, which had a long
                    history in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, was not merely copied from English precedents but took character from conditions in
                    the New World. Even the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Virginia County</region>
                    </placeName> Court was as much American as it was English.</p>
            <p>This volume is a very creditable product of the historian's skill and the
                    bookmaker's art. There are useful illustrations and a helpful selective and critical
                    bibliography. It is an excellent first volume for the series.</p>

            <p>During the course of World War II literally scores of eye-witness stories and journalistic accounts
                    of campaigns, particular battles, or perhaps certain phases of civilian activity were produced for
                    popular consumption. Some deserve special praise for their merit, accuracy, and usefulness as
                    records of what happened. Following these, and after the war, came a number of personal accounts,
                    such as Dwight D. Eisenhower's <hi rend="i">Crusade in Europe</hi>, which, by virtue of
                    their narrators, were semi-official and authentic records of theaters of operation in which the
                    writers had served in primary roles.</p>
            <p>More ambitious and all-inclusive projects are now being undertaken to serve as official accounts of
                    the war as successfully waged by the major branches of the armed forces. These projected efforts
                    will be monumental in scope and service to the average layman whose access to military records and
                    documents is nil. Samuel Eliot Morison's <hi rend="i">History of United States Naval
                        Operations in World War II</hi> will reach thirteen volumes. The army's <hi rend="i">United States Army in World War II</hi> is scheduled for a stupendous undertaking that <pb n="430" id="VAA4025-045-4-108"/> will number nearly a hundred volumes. Of a similar nature is
                    the official chronicle of the army air forces, <hi rend="i">The Army Air Forces in World War
                    II</hi>. The latter will be recorded in seven volumes.</p>
            <p>In several respects there remains more virgin territory for the historian to explore in the realm of
                    military history than in many others. This is especially true in the field of military operations
                    conducted since the advent of the airplane. Though there are those who would take issue as to the
                    actual significance of the air arm of any military machine in modern warfare there is a distinct
                    need for someone to do for it what Karl von Clausewitz did for the ground forces in his <hi rend="i">Vom Kriege</hi>, and what Alfred Thayer Mahan did for naval forces in his <hi rend="i">The
                        Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783</hi>, and in subsequent works.
                    Meanwhile, however, such works as the one presently under consideration will present new vistas in
                    what is virtually a pioneer field for historians.</p>
            <p>The task of directing and editing these volumes was undertaken by Wesley Frank Craven of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> University, and James Lea Cate of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, both associated with the historical division of the air force, only with the
                    understanding that access to all necessary documents would be afforded the researchers and full
                    approval granted for their use and interpretation. This, obviously, was to prevent axe grinding,
                    biased interpretations, or glossing. The best tents of historical methodology have been observed in
                    its composition and construction. The book is "considered as a final report to the American
                    public on the activities of the AAF in World War II" (p. viii).</p>
            <p>The eighteen chapters of this volume are from the pens of ten authors all of whom were staff members
                    engaged in the air force historical program during the war. With a preface giving a brief
                    organizational account of the army's air branch following its establishment as the Aviation
                    Section of the Signal Corps in 1914, and a more detailed review of the 1939–1941 efforts
                    to make the air force ready for war, it deals primarily with the war in the air which began at Pearl
                    Harbor and Hickam Field. Richard L. Watson has written one of the best accounts on the Pearl Harbor
                    incident yet to appear. William A. Goss' chapter entitled "Air Defense of the
                    Western Hemisphere" is especially informational <pb n="431" id="VAA4025-045-4-109"/> on a
                    subject often otherwise slighted. After special chapters presenting problems on air defense in the
                    Netherlands East Indies, Australia, New Guinea, and China, the volume closes with preparations for
                    the air war against Germany and as such serves as an introduction for the second volume which is to
                    deal more specifically with that problem. The casual reader will not be able to enjoy this book as
                    easily as a best seller or as one done in a popular style, but if he is at all interested in air
                    force history he will find it readable, accurate, and interesting. After the first volume the
                    average reader will be more likely to be concerned with the one in which the story of his special
                    interest is presented. The editors and publishers are to be commended for an attractive,
                    informational, scholarly, and readable account.</p>

            <p>October 20, 1926, was a sad occasion for the working-man. ‘Gene Debs had died! No doubt
                    his many friends remember the words: "Let the people take heart and hope everywhere, for
                    the cross is bending, the midnight is passing, and joy cometh with the morning." Ray
                    Ginger, a candidate for the Ph.D. in American Culture at Western Reserve University, has written the
                    biography of Debs in accordance with the sympathy and sentiment expressed in the above question. The
                    title of the book is entirely appropriate, and it is illustrative of the colorful life of an
                    outstanding man.</p>
            <p>Ginger's life of Debs is an example of the new school of "scholarly"
                    writing for the general public. The advocates of this method of writing would seem to approve of a
                    semi-literary style which is all inclusive, with few or no footnotes to disturb the reader. The
                    author, in a typical mid-western spirit, uses first names indiscriminately, particularly of
                    Debs' parents, throughout the book. Moreover, numerous details garnered from documents,
                    letters, memories of those who knew Debs intimately or remotely have been <pb n="432" id="VAA4025-045-4-110"/> included in this biography. Unfortunately, the author is neither a
                    master of trivia nor adept at the art of subtly qualifying statements of judgment. The difficulty in
                    this kind of writing is, with its interminable data, in enticing the reader to stay to the end of
                    such a lengthy and often tedious book.</p>
            <p>The reader is obliged to search for the larger significances. The table of contents is non-revealing.
                    One might be inclined to ask: What are the relationships between each of the four topics listed in
                    the table of contents and the subject of the biography? These relationships could be clarified by
                    the use of chapter headings throughout the book.</p>
            <p>Actually, however, the biography is interesting—if one disregards the occasional illogical
                    paragraphs and inconsistencies in the style.</p>
            <p>Ginger's review of the entire labor situation in the crucial period of the 1880's
                    is informative. He explains in detail the reasons for the change in Debs' attitude toward
                    the use of strikes. Debs' managerial ability in the Great Northern Strike as well as his
                    skillful baiting of Governor Knut Nelson is well done by the author. Ginger has carefully evaluated
                    the significance of the Pullman strike and Debs' subsequent conflicts with the federal
                    authorities.</p>
            <p>Debs' part (1905–1907) in the radical organization of the I.W.W. and in the
                    dramatic struggles among the numerous leftists and labor leaders is related rather well. Some new
                    information is presented relative to the Haywood-Pettibone-Moyer <hi rend="i">vs</hi>. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="idu">Idaho</region>
                    </placeName> case. And the reasons given for Debs' espousal of the I.W.W. principles as
                    well as for his withdrawal from that organization in 1908 are worth noting. Contrary to
                    Ginger's idea, however, the manner in which Debs dropped his membership from the I.W.W.
                    seems to have been characteristic of the man. The latter never hated those who disagreed with him
                    but only the principles for which they stood. Yet, Ginger injudiciously affirms that Debs intensely
                    disliked not only Wilson but Samuel Gompers as well. The author, however, does not seem to think
                    that it is possible to separate hatred of personalities from hatred of their actions. Apparently
                    Eugene Debs' great love for humanity permitted him to do so.</p>
            <p>In contenting himself with sheer biographical narrative, Ginger falls somewhat short of the
                    scholars' goal. The book <pb n="433" id="VAA4025-045-4-111"/> is neither analytical in
                    quality nor judicious in quantity. The style is verbose, and in places it is colloquial and
                    ungrammatical. The author, however, shows that he is capable of being objective. One example of his
                    objectivity is shown by his portrayal of Mrs. Kate Debs. This is especially commendable in view of a
                    recent novel in which the wife of Debs is grossly misrepresented.</p>
            <p>A further criticism of the book is that by giving all available facts and impressions about Debs it
                    tends to obscure vital issues. There is no doubt, on the other hand, that this biography does supply
                    the data out of which balanced conclusions can be deduced. These possible conclusions would be
                    particularly relevant to present-day problems such as strikes, suppression of opinion, and
                    intolerance.</p>

            <p>The demand for textbooks in recent and contemporary history continues to challenge historians to keep
                    their writing up to the minute. Consequently the question arises as to whether such history can be
                    as objective as that which awaits further sources of information and the attainment of proper
                    perspective. Furthermore, by the time such a book is off the press new events often overshadow what
                    was the latest information at the time the writer completed his manuscript. Despite the criticism of
                    works in this category, it must be admitted that there is excellence in many of them, and that few
                    historians equal and none surpass Dr. Benns in his capacity to produce a text that is so up to date
                    and at the same time so free from bias.</p>
            <p>The seventh edition of <hi rend="i">Europe since 1914</hi> compares very favorably with the sixth.
                    For one thing, it is much better proportioned. With almost one hundred additional pages, the
                    revision begins on page 490 effecting a drastic reduction of about eighty-five pages in the story of
                    the second world war; this welcome change makes possible a much more comprehensive treatment of the
                    second postwar period without <pb n="434" id="VAA4025-045-4-112"/> making the book unwieldly. The
                    maps and illustrations are the same except for one picture and for some rearrangements and, of
                    course, for additions for the second postwar period; as in previous editions, they are very well
                    chosen. Two tables of questionable value have been omitted. The bibliographies for each chapter are
                    well selected; additional references have been inserted in the older chapters, and those in the new
                    chapters are of equal fitness. The problem of keeping up to date is illustrated in the omission of
                    the <hi rend="i">Goebbels Diaries</hi> in the section on Germany during the war—doubtless
                    this is a matter of the time of publication.</p>
            <p>The quality of the seventh edition is in keeping with that of the preceding ones. Dr. Benns'
                    lucidity of style has made the work understandable to an unusual degree. His freedom from bias, even
                    from undertones of prejudice, is more conspicious in this than in the preceding edition. Some might
                    find fault with the absence of any particular interpretation, on the ground that some students may
                    be lost in the array of facts that such a work must necessarily present. But from the viewpoint of
                    the reviewer, this policy increases the objectivity of the work.</p>
            <p>In fact, it would be difficult to take issue with Dr. Benns on either his selection or organization.
                    In the seventh edition he has made use of new sources of information to clear up such points as the
                    failure of Anglo-Russian conversations in 1939 and the full provisions of the Russo-German
                    agreements of that same summer. His attempt to keep up to the minute has quite naturally left some
                    generalizations up in the air, as on page 750 concerning the probable future status of India. His
                    topical arrangement of the second world war might be criticized: while undoubtedly the narrative of
                    the European phases through the surrender of Germany, followed by a history of the Far Eastern War
                    from 1941 to 1946, has the advantage of an unbroken and clear-cut treatment, cross currents are not
                    quite so clear. This task, however, may well be that of the instructor rather than the writer. Dr.
                    Benns' treatment of the controversial field of recent and contemporary European history has
                    again been very adequate; students and teachers will await with anticipation an eighth edition of
                        <hi rend="i">Europe since 1914</hi>.</p>

            <p>Anna Catharina Müllerin was born October 15, 1783, of Lutheran parents on the border
                    between France and Germany. The given names of her parents are not known. About 1805 she was married
                    to Johannes Hensel (or Henzel). The Johannes Hensel family resided in western Germany in the
                    Province of Hessen, village of Bergheim. They attended the Lutheran church in the village. Three
                    daughters were born to them during their residence at Bergheim: Anna in 1807, Elizabetha in 1810,
                    and Catharina in 1818.</p>
            <p>Sometime prior to 1834 Johannes Hensel died. By this time his family had received letters from German
                    and French immigrants who were residing in the United States. These friends from across the ocean
                    were writing back to their friends and relatives in Germany telling them of the vast resources in
                    their new home. Often the people in Germany had food shortages—some died from starvation.
                    These letters from the United States told of a land of plenty—where the thrifty could own
                    their own land and could raise more than enough for themselves.</p>
            <p>As more and more letters from the United States brought favorable reports of the living conditions
                    there, the three Hensel girls decided to leave their native land and immigrate to the United States.
                    By this time the two oldest girls had married and had families of their own. Anna, who had married
                    Conrad Bickel, was the mother of three children: Conrad, Johannes, and Anna. Elizabetha had married
                    Johannes Rupp and had one son, Heinrich. The youngest daughter was nineteen and unmarried. The three
                    girls persuaded their mother to make the trip to America with them. They disposed of what personal
                    property they could not take with them and had the necessary papers for the journey filled out by
                    August, 1837. Early the following <list type="footnotes">

                    the youngest daughter, Catharina Hensel, was married to Johannes Seitz. Elizabetha Hensel, who had
                    been married in Germany wanted her marriage recorded in this country and so appeared with her
                    husband Johannes Rupp before George Brandan, justice of the peace, and repeated her marriage vows.

                    </placeName>. This land had previously been settled by English people, but a few French and German
                    immigrants had bought farms in the neighborhood. The latter followed their own customs and spoke
                    their native tongue. This apparently annoyed the English and more and more of them offered their
                    farms for sale. These were immediately purchased by German immigrants. Thus during the period from

                    </placeName>, the Hensel daughters and their families attended the St. Paul Evangelical Lutheran
                    Church in western <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township. This church was better known as Siegwalds. Here they worshipped for almost a
                    decade until the pastor who was then serving the church wanted the congregation to change to another
                    denomination. These German settlers had been reared in Lutheran churches and were not to be easily
                    persuaded to change. So during the latter part of the 1840's the Bickel, Rupp, and Seitz
                    families and many of their friends withdrew their membership from the Siegwald Church and commenced
                    worshipping in homes throughout their community. These services were often conducted in the home of
                    Conrad and Anna Hensel Bickel or in the home of John Gimble. When no itinerant <pb n="437" id="VAA4025-045-4-115"/> Lutheran pastor was available, one of the men of the congregation would
                    read the scripture and conduct the service by reading from Arndt's True Christianity or
                    from one of Martin Luther's sermons. Soon this group organized themselves into a
                    congregation known as St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church, and plans were made to erect
                    a church building.</p>
            <p>On May 31, 1851, Thomas Enfield (or Infield) and wife, Sarah, deeded one acre of land to John Seitz,
                    John Rupp, and Frederick Ellwanger, trustees of the Evangelic Lutheran Church St. Peter. Henry Rupp,
                    son of John Rupp, went around the community to notify all the members of the log rolling for the new
                    church. With the help of a team of oxen, the trees were felled and logs rolled together to erect the
                    building which was 24 by 36 feet. This log structure remained standing until 1920. It was located
                    near the front or east of the present cemetery.</p>
            <p>Seven years later John Rupp and his wife deeded part of their farm for a parsonage. A further
                    purchase of land adjoining the cemetery was made on March 14, 1879, from Jacob Richert, Sr., and
                    wife. This was conveyed to Jacob Richert, Sr., John Richert, and John Bickel, Sr., trustees of the
                    church. This is the land on which the present brick church building was erected; this building was
                    dedicated on May 26, 1881.</p>
            <p>After the erection of the brick structure, the old log church continued to be used for school
                    purposes. Here the pastor taught the children to read and to write the German language. The children
                    also learned the catechism, songs, and scriptures in German. That language was used in the
                    confirmation service until about 1898. Preaching services continued in German until about 1917 when
                    the sentiment growing out of the First World War caused its discontinuance.</p>
            <p>This first log church was very plain and simple—no bell or belfry—one double
                    door but no windows in the front. There were three windows on each side. The ceiling was low and the
                    benches straight and plain. The backs of the benches had a drop-leaf table arrangement which could
                    be raised on school days so that the children would have a place to study and write. An isle led
                    down the middle of the church to the altar and pulpit which was on a low platform. <pb n="438" id="VAA4025-045-4-116"/> A little organ which was pumped by foot furnished the music.</p>
            <p>From the time the Hensels came to America, Anna Catharina Hensel, the mother, resided in the homes of
                    her daughters and sons-in-law. The major part of her time was spent with her daughter, Mrs. Conrad
                    Bickel. It was here that she died on February 7, 1862 in her 79th year. The stone on her grave, just
                    north of the first church building, was inscribed in German: "Hier Ruht Catharina John
                    Hen-sel's Ehe Frau Geboren Am 15 Oct. 1783 Gestorben Am 7 Feb. 1862."</p>
            <p>Although Catharina Müllerin Hensel died in 1862 her descendants have continued to
                    perpetuate St. Peter's Church. Through her three daughters, her descendants have increased
                    and multiplied until it would be safe to draw the conclusion that all during the history of St.
                    Peter's the majority of its members have been descendants of this Catharina
                    Müllerin and her husband Johannes Hensel. It is then quite proper that she lie buried in
                    the churchyard at St. Peter's where she has kept the spiritual light burning down through
                    many years through her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and those who follow after.</p>
