            <p>Richard W. Thompson was born in Culpepper County in the heart of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Piedmont on June 9, 1809. He grew up amid unusual surroundings, coming under the direct
                    influence of men of the Revolutionary period. It was his good fortune to see Jefferson, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>, whose homes were not distant from Culpepper. He was present at the inauguration of
                    Andrew Jackson in 1829. His father and many of his relatives were slave owners, but young Thompson
                    saw none of the harsher aspects of slavery. The system was to a large extent a patriarchal one in
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> of that period. This may account in part for his conservatism on the subject in later
                    life.</p>
            <p>Like hundreds of other young Virginians of the time his thoughts began to turn toward the great West.
                    In 1831 he set out on horseback through the wilderness for the country beyond the mountains. For a
                    short time he clerked in a store in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> from whence he removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Here he presided over the Lawrence County Seminary for a term and was then
                    employed in a store. Into his hands fell some law books which he diligently read. Charles Dewey, one
                    of the most prominent lawyers of southern Indiana of that day, was attracted to the young man and
                    loaned him more books. He was soon admitted to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> bar. In 1834 he was elected to the lower house of the General Assembly as a Whig, a
                    party name just coming into use. Here he served two terms and in 1836 was elected to the state
                    senate, where he was chosen president <hi rend="i">pro tern.</hi> In the state <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-027-3-002"/> legislature he became an ardent champion of internal improvements.</p>
            <p>Thompson was one of the original Harrison men in Indiana, and served as one of the galaxy of Whig
                    orators in the famous "log cabin and hard cider" campaign of 1840. The reputation
                    that he achieved in this contest led to his election to Congress from the second congressional
                    district in 1841.</p>
            <p>As a member of the twenty-seventh Congress, Thompson joined with the Whig majority in the war against
                    Tyler. He was one of the signers of the "Manifesto." He followed the leadership of
                    Henry Clay, supporting the bank bills, distribution, and a protective tariff. He likewise worked
                    earnestly for an appropriation to complete the Cumberland Road. The heated controversy over slavery
                    and the lack of interest manifested in matters of real importance to the country were strongly
                    condemned by Thompson. He was not a candidate for reelection. In 1843 he removed from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the growing town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he soon became one of the leading lawyers. In 1844 he served again as one of the
                    Whig presidential electors. Three years later, he was chosen a member of the national Hohe of
                    Representatives from the seventh district, defeating Joseph A. Wright.</p>
            <p>As a member of the thirtieth Congress, he formed a close friendship with Lincoln, the lone Whig
                    representative from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. He joined the Whig attack upon the Mexican War, claiming that Polk had forced the war
                    upon the country in an unconstitutional manner. At the same time, he became one of the outstanding
                    opponents among northern Whigs of anti-slavery agitation. He voted against the prohibition of
                    slavery as well as the prohibition of the slave trade in the District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1848 he favored the nomination of Henry Clay for president. However, following the
                    nomination of Zachary Taylor, he supported him. Tlie speech of Colonel Thompson which was received
                    with greatest enthusiasm during the campaign was delivered at a ratification meeting in Monument
                    Square, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for which the citizens of that city presented him with a silver goblet.</p>
            <p>Thompson early became one of the supporters of a railroad to the Pacific. He joined forces in Indiana
                    with the forward looking men in behalf of the movement for free public schools. His retirement from
                    Congress in 1849 marked <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-027-3-003"/> in no degree any slackening of interest
                    upon his part in the political issues of the day. He found himself in general agreement with
                    Presidect Taylor's views on the slavery question. The President recommended that Congress
                    await the action of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> in forming state governments for themselves. "We should abstain,"
                    Taylor declared, "from the introduction of these exciting topics of a sectional
                        character."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thompson wrote a series of articles for the <hi rend="i">National Intelligencer</hi>, one of the
                    leading Whig newspapers of the country which was published in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in support of Taylor's position. The articles appeared in February, 1850,
                    after <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s Compromise Measures had been introduced, and were signed
                    "Americus." The contributions were represented by the editors as coming from a
                    source so much entitled to respect that they felt bound to make room for them in their columns.</p>
            <p>The writer began by declaring that the debate in Congress had awakened in his mind "a most
                    painful anxiety" for the safety of the Union. Every man was justified in saying what he
                    could to quiet the tempest into which the public mind had been lashed. He hoped to be able to
                    contribute something "to that quiet and respose" which the country so much needed.
                    He was prompted only, he said, by a national spirit and by a fixed attachment to every part of the
                    Union. He had examined <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s proposals and had heard his speech in Congress. While commending <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s mighty effort to preserve and perpetuate the Union and to arouse the spirit
                    of compromise in both sections, he did not consider them as the most practicable method of adjusting
                    the difficulties. He considered the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> boundary question a judicial one which belonged to the Supreme Court. It was not the
                    time to bring up the question of slavery or the slave trade in the District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, nor the question of a fugitive slave law. He did not think it necessary to provide a
                    territorial government for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> at once, as this would only operate to widen the breach. He would admit <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> with her constitution as communicated to Congress by the President. As to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> and Deseret (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="utu">Utah</region>
                    </placeName>), he would adppt a policy of "hands off"—and await action
                    upon their part. <list type="footnotes">

                    acquire the necessary population and adopt a constitution. He believed that the people of a
                    territory should have the right to form a constitution prohibiting or recognizing slavery as they
                    pleased. The North held one view relative to the question of slavery in the territories, the South
                    held another. He would have Congress leave the question alone.</p>
            <p>"Americus" [Thompson] spoke as "a son of the South," as one who
                    first saw the light beneath her mild sky, the bones of whose fathers slept under her sod, and who
                    loved her with a devotion which neither age, nor time, nor absence, nor circumstances could abate.
                    Continuing, he declared: "Under the influence of all these emotions which crowd upon me I
                    solemnly aver that I would not counsel her to a deed that would sully that fame, or tarnish that
                    honor. When I speak of the fame and honor of the South, I speak of it as blended with the fame and
                    honor of the North."</p>
            <p>Concerning the Abolitionists, Thompson could not speak too bitterly, They were referred to as having
                    "assailed with a reckless malignity of heart the integrity of the Union. They have kept the
                    caulron of their passions boiling over by their treasonable design beneath the pretense of humanity
                    and philanthropy…. They have borne about with them the torch of the incendiary, with
                    which they would fire the Capitol from its basement to its dome. They would light up the fires of
                    civil discord all over the land and exult in the work of their desolation."</p>
            <p>The great body of the people in the North were conservative. They were as true to the impulses of a
                    lofty patriotism as the people of the South. They loved the Union. They would trust the South if the
                    South would trust them. The great majority of the people of the country he believed, were willing to
                    stand on the ground of compromise. Their patriotism was not bounded by geographical divisions nor
                    circumscribed by state lines.</p>
            <p>President Taylor's course was defended. "He has stood," declared the
                    writer, "like a faithful sentinel upon the watch towers guarding the rights of both the
                    North and the South and [is] determined to stand by the Union at all hazards."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On July 5, 1850, Thompson addressed a letter to the two Senators from Indiana, both Democrats, James
                    Whitcomb <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-027-3-005"/> and Jesse D. Bright, approving of their support of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s Compromise proposals. He still preferred Taylor's plan but thought
                    there was little chance of its being adopted. "Under this state of things," he
                    wrote, "I should consider it my duty to support any other proposition that would be likely
                    to restore peace, harmony, and quiet to the country. I would therefore vote without hesitation for
                    the bill reported by Mr. Clay from the select committee of thirteen. I would vote for it as a peace
                    offering upon the altar of the Union and with a conviction that it would restore concord to the
                    country while it would furnish to neither the North nor South any ground for exaltation."
                    He then entered into a lengthy defense of the Fugitive Slave Bill.</p>
            <p>Following the adoption of the Compromise proposals of 1850, Thompson upheld them. The main features
                    of the Compromise he regarded as being based upon the general principles avowed by General Taylor.</p>
            <p>Colonel Thompson attended the Whig convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1852 though not as a delegate. The balloting at this convention for a candidate for
                    president was prolonged. Becoming alarmed over the strong sectional feeling manifested and fearing
                    the break-up of the convention without nominating anyone, Thompson addressed a communication to the
                    Indiana delegates who had been voting as a unit for Scott, advising them to cast the vote of the
                    state for Fillmore. This action he believed would settle the controversy at once. It would be an
                    example of conciliation. It would be very appropriate because the Whig party in Indiana was
                    conservative, had full confidence in Fillmore, and approved of his administration.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thompson's views concerning the Whig nomination were shared by many conservative Whigs.
                    Fillmore was the logical candidate. Webster was willing to withdraw in his favor. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> declared from his death bed, "Fillmore by all means." Either Fillmore
                    or Webster could have been nominated had their supporters been able to unite on one or the other
                    candidate. Southern Whigs agreed at a conference to go over to Webster providing sufficient northern
                    votes could be pledged to the <placeName>

            <p>Many Southern Whigs, however, feared Scott's loyalty to the compromise measures. They
                    believed him to be under the influence of northern anti-slavery Whigs, such as Seward. "He
                    is the favorite candidate of the Free-Soil wing of the Whig Party," wrote Alexander H.
                    Stephens, "and as such, in my judgment, he is not entitled to the support of any Southern
                    man who looks to the protection of the rights of the South and the Union of the states."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>The Whigs were disastrously defeated in the election. Scott lost all of the states of the Old
                    Northwest. He carried, in fact, but four states in the Union. This proved to be the last battle
                    waged by the Whig Party under that name. When, two years later, as a result of the <placeName>

                    into that party. Thompson's conservatism led him to hold aloof from this new party in its
                    early years. He was an "old line Whig" who found it difficult to affiliate with
                    any sectional party.</p>
            <p>Many Whigs sought refuge in the American Party, commonly known as the
                    "Know-Nothing" Party. This party was quite generally regarded as the successor of
                    the Whig Party. In affiliating with it the old Whigs certainly surrendered none of their principles.
                    Some even believed that it would result in the resuscitation of the Whig Party itself.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> "The star of Whiggery must rise and its flame be rekindled," wrote the

            <p>The secrecy of the Know-Nothing movement and the anti-foreign, anti-Catholic activities of some of
                    its supporters in the larger cities, have received much attention. The more significant aspects of
                    the American Party as a conservative force in politics have been largely ignored. Yet it was this
                    phase of the movement that appealed to men of the character of Thompson, Fillmore, Bell, and
                    Crittenden. "I claim to be a Whig," declared Thompson in 1855. "I started
                    a Whig, I have always been a Whig without wavering or shadow of turning to the right or to the left.
                    I have served that party when I had the strength to serve it, and now though as a party it may not
                    exist, I cherish its principles with all the ardour of my nature."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Toward abolitionists Thompson's opinion had not changed. He exhausted his vocabulary in
                    denouncing them. "They snuff excitement from every breeze," he exclaimed,
                    "and go forth like a war horse always ready for battle, provided the rights of the negro
                    are assailed! They can listen perfectly unmoved to the wrongs of the white man, his cries and
                    agonies do not reach their ears. To his voice of supplication they are always deaf. Hundreds of
                    thousands of their own race may be slain upon the field of inglorious war, and their un-buried and
                    decaying bodies may turn whole plains and valleys into lazar-houses of the dead, yet no sympathetic
                    groan escapes from them. But if a single lash is drawn across the back of a disobedient slave, they
                    shrink with holy horror at the thought…. And these are the men with whom you and I are
                    asked to unite in political action. For one, I will not do it. The spirit of the departed dead
                    forbids it. The voice of my fathers crying to me from the tomb forbids it. All my past associations
                    forbid it. My devotion to Whig principles forbids it. My devotion to the Union forbids it. The
                    admonitions of the Father of his Country forbid it. My om heart and conscience forbid it. And come
                    what may I will not do it."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Concerning the sincerity of Thompson's motives there can be no question. He had no selfish
                    ends to serve. He was not a seeker for political preferment. "I care not what they call
                    me," he declared, "So long as I have the approval of my own conscience and feel
                    that I am right. As for their offices, I despise them. I would not exchange the quiet of my own home
                    here amongst you my neighbors and friends, for all the offices they can give or take away."</p>
            <p>The speech quoted from above was delivered in <placeName>

                    </placeName> on August 11, 1855. It resulted in a bitter controversy between Thompson and Horace

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> Greeley attempted to convict Thompson of inconsistency. He pointed out
                    that as a member of the thirtieth congress Thompson had supported a bill to organize the territory
                    acquired from Mexico with slavery excluded. This accusation was flatly denied by Colonel Thompson.
                    He had simply voted on one occasion against a motion to lay the bill on the table and on another
                    occasion in favor of reporting the bill to the House. He had no intention of voting for the measure
                    on its final passage. He declared that he would have voted also for a resolution, the Gott
                    Resolution, to report a bill providing for the abolition of slavery in the District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> but for a preamble which he regarded as offensive to the South. But this did not mean
                    that he would have supported a bill to abolish slavery in the District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the final vote. Members of Congress frequently voted in favor of reporting measures
                    to which they were absolutely opposed.</p>
            <p>The controversy proved that Thompson was perfectly able to take care of himself and that when aroused
                    he was as apt with the pen as was Greeley in the use of scathing invective. He concluded his letter
                    to Greeley as follows: "If you are resolved that I shall have no further space in the
                    Tribune I propose that you meet me upon the stump and discuss the questions at issue…. I

                    </placeName> to a large audience. The platform upon which Buchanan, the Democratic candidate for

                    Both factions were day by day "weakening the bonds that bound together in one common

                    </placeName> which is quoted in part: "We are peculiarly situated here. R. W. Thompson is

            <p>Before the campaign ended, Thompson took the place of one of the American electors who had withdrawn.

                    to Frémont. It was believed that this would increase the chances of throwing the election
                    into the House of Representatives, where Fillmore would probably be chosen as a compromise
                    candidate. This action was opposed by Thompson on the ground that it was too late to swing the vote
                    to Frémont. Fillmore received 22, 386 votes in Indiana, while Buchanan's
                    plurality over Frémont was 24, 295. Fillmore's total popular vote in the entire

                    During the succeeding two years Thompson and other American leaders in Indiana devoted their
                    energies to keeping alive the principles advocated by the party endeavoring to secure their
                    acceptance by other parties, more especially by the Republican Party.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Party names meant little to Thompson during this period of his life. It was principles that really
                    counted with him. He would "unite with any set of men or party," he declared in a
                    speech at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName> in September, 1857, "by whatever name, who would strive to bring back the
                    government to the good old way that would relieve it from its present downward and deplorable
                    condition and administer it in such a way to secure the constitutional rights of all

            </p>
            <p>Early in 1858, Colonel Thompson took occasion to restate his own views and those of the American
                    Party on the all-absorbing question of the hour, slavery. His article appeared in the <hi rend="i">Daily Union</hi> of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> and was reprinted in other newspapers. He was looking for a party which would consider
                    itself as having a higher mission than to excite hatred between the North and the South and would
                    invoke the spirit of concord, harmony, and good neighborliness in all intercourse between the two
                    sections. "We shall let slavery alone ourselves," he declared, "and
                    persuade others to do so still. We shall leave the states where slavery exists to do with it just as
                    they please, and to enjoy all the rights given by the Constitution. We shall leave the people of a
                    territory to form their own institutions and to have slavery or not as they please when they make a
                    constitution for admission into the Union." He was not in favor of popular sovereignty as
                    championed by Douglas, who maintained the right of the territorial legislatures either to establish
                    or exclude slavery. This meant continual agitation and he was opposed to it. "We shall
                    refuse to interfere with slavery in the District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>," he added. "We shall insist upon the faithful execution of the
                    Fugitive Slave Laws. Thus it will be our policy to take the question altogether out of Congress and
                    out of political contests—in other words to let it alone."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>The attempt to organize a strong conservative, nationwide party opposed to the agitation of the
                    slavery question was rendered more difficult by the events of Buchanan's administration.
                    The Dred Scott decision, the Lecompton struggle, John Brown's raid, and other exciting
                    incidents served only to increase the sectional strife. The American Party itself was disrupted by
                    the slavery issue. Many of its members in the north found their way into the Republican Party before
                    1860. Some of the more conservative members of the party made one more effort to form a conservative
                    party. The new party was given the name of the Constitutional Union Party.</p>

                    </placeName> who proposed three platforms. The first one was for the "harmonious

                    </placeName> Resolutions followed by two planks, one in favor of excluding slavery from the
                    territories, and the other in favor of forcing it in, both to be adopted unanimously by the
                    convention. The second platform was for the "irrepressible conflict gentlemen"
                    about to assemble at <placeName>

                    wife on Sunday and the second in reference to burning witches. For the Constitutional Union
                    Convention now in session he proposed a platform declaring in favor of "the constitution as

            <p>Great unanimity prevailed throughout the proceedings of the convention. A brief declaration of
                    principles was adopted favoring "the Constitution of the country, the union of the states,
                    and the enforcement of the laws." Ten persons received votes for the nomination for

                    "twin relics of barbarism." The desire to win the old Know Nothing and
                    conservative Whig vote in Indiana and thus assure Republican success there had been one of the main
                    pleas of Henry S. Lane and other leaders in favor of Lincoln's nomination at <placeName>

                    extent realized. Lincoln was considered so much more acceptable than Sward that many who had
                    refrained from affiliating with the Republican Party now went over to it. The chief problem in the

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on August 15. One hundred fifty delegates were present, most of them from the southern
                    portion of the state. The greater number were men who were not generally known. They were referred
                    to by the <placeName>

            <p>Colonel Thompson was one of the most prominent leaders in this convention. There was a rumor that he
                    was about to abandon the party. This arose because he had expressed confidence in Lincoln as a
                    conservative leader. Thompson emphatically denied that he intended to desert the party. He did
                    request that he should not be named as an elector on the Constitutional Union ticket on account of
                    business affairs which might take him out of the country. He was reluctantly excused from this
                    service. No state ticket was nominated.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>A few days after the adjournment of the convention, Thompson delivered an address in <placeName>

                    profound attention. The speaker declared that Douglas, the candidate of the Northern Democrats, and
                    Breckinridge, the candidate of the Southern Democrats, were both sectional candidates. The

                    being more national than either of the others. It was the only National Convention. The Republican
                    Party contained many radicals but Mr. Lincoln he believed to be a conservative on the slavery
                    question. Lincoln held that slavery was legal in the states where it then existed and was entitled
                    to protection there; that Congress had no right to abolish slavery in the District of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> without the consent of the owners, that the people of a state when they did come to
                    form their constitution were entitled to the right to decide whether the state should be slave or
                    free. Thompson maintained that Lincoln was chiefly indebted for his nomination to the conservatism
                    of Indiana Republicans. He admitted that he was gratified with the success of the conservative
                    element among the Republicans.</p>
            <p>Referring to the convention that nominated Bell, Thompson said; "I believe there were never
                    assembled in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> a body of men who for wisdom, calmness, disinterestedness, and sincerity, were their
                    superiors, unless it was some of those early assemblies of our forefathers who were without
                    equals." He had favored the nomination of Justice McLean who was an old Whig, a
                    conservative man, and one upon whom the Amreican, the Whig, and the Republican parties might have
                    united. The convention, however, had nominated Mr. Bell, who was known to the country as "a
                    conservative upright, and honest man, and an eminent statesman."</p>
            <p>"I wish," continued Thompson, "that all the people of the North and the
                    Union men of the South could look upon this thing as I do and see the necessity of uniting upon some
                    man for president, who, like Mr. Bell, stands upon a platform not sectional and not ultra, and who
                    would do his duty with an eye single to the welfare and honor of the whole nation." He saw
                    little prospect of this taking place. He did not believe that any candidate could command a majority
                    of the electors unless it should be Lincoln whose chances were increasing.</p>
            <p>"If Mr. Lincoln is elected to the presidency," Thompson added, "he will be
                    entitled to the respect of every man in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. His strength consists of his conservatism. His own principles we conservative. I know
                    him well. I served in Congress with him. I was upon very intimate terms with <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-027-3-019"/> him, and I know just how he felt about this question of slavery. During
                    the time we were there, with few exceptions, we voted together always."</p>
            <p>Referring to the wants of the South the speaker declared: "They want the fugitive slave law
                    executed. Mr. Lincoln says that it shall be executed. They want the right of the territories
                    recognized to come into the Union as slave states. Mr. Lincoln says it shall be recognized. They
                    want the rights of all the states preserved. Mr. Lincoln says they shall be preserved. He differs
                    with them on the question of the Wilmot Proviso. Lincoln says it should be passed to prohibit
                    slavery in the territories. But there cannot be any Wilmot Proviso during Lincoln's term,
                    if he is elected, because the Democrats will have a majority of the Senate until 1865 and they can
                    prevent the passage of such a measure."<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The speech throughout was the sincere utterance of a lover of the Union. His early associations with
                    the fathers of the Republic and with the great Whig leaders of the middle period of our history had
                    so profoundly influenced him that he could not be otherwise. With Webster he might have said,
                    "I speak today for the preservation of the Union."</p>
            <p>Though Thompson did not support Lincoln in 1860, he was not unfriendly toward hiin as the speech
                    quoted above clearly indicates. The two men understood one another. They corresponded during the
                    campaign. In a letter from Lincoln dated July 10 and marked "private" reference is
                    made to a letter received from Thompson on July 6. Then Lincoln adds: "I wish you would
                    watch <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    from me again."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> A few days later Lincoln dispatched his private

            <p>Thompson explained that Lincoln believed that if the Constitutional Union Party should disband many
                    of the Whigs affiliated with that party would go into the Democratic Party. This might result in the
                    loss of Indiana by Lincoln. Hence he <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Colonel Thompson had always been friendly toward Henry S. Lane the Republican candidate for governor
                    of Indiana in 1860, and now supported him in his campaign for the governorship. Early in September
                    Lane wrote to Thompson asking for his aid. The friends of Bell and Everett in the state were being
                    urged by various persons in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to support the Democratic state ticket at the October election in order that the state
                    might be carried by Douglas. This was very disturbing to Lane, who counted upon the support of the
                    Constitutional Unionists. "Now in the present position of our canvass," wrote
                    Lane, "if you can consistently with your sense of duty say a word in favor of our ticket in
                    public you will in my opinion confer a very great favor on the country and a personal obligation on
                    myself never to be forgotten."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the eve of the state election in October, Thompson seized the opportunity to speak out strongly
                    for Lane in a statement addressed "To the conservative men of Indiana." It was
                    written on the cars while traveling from <placeName>

                    chosen as governor, but Thompson thought not. "One of the great evils of the
                    time," he declared, "is that attention to national politics has destroyed the
                    dignity and lessened the importance of state governments. We should be greatly better off if we
                    looked less to the Federal government and more to the states."</p>
            <p>He was against giving way to disunionists in the South because of the possibility that they would
                    break up the Union if Lincoln were elected. Thompson declared that Breckenridge was nominated by a
                    convention as sectional as the one at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. "Our true position," he continued, "is midway between the
                    extreme parties. We should repudiate sectionalism at both extremes. We are bound to frown upon every
                    attempt at secession…. If our party shall prevail, I desire to see it do so by virtue of
                    its principles and not by becoming the all of Democracy…. If its principles are worth
                    anything they are worth maintaining through good and evil report. I helped to nominate Mr. Bell and
                    shall vote for him and nobody else."</p>
            <p>Concerning the state situation, Thompson said: "We do gain something by Lane's
                    election and therefore I shall vote for him. He is an old Whig educated in the faith taught by Henry
                    Clay. He and I have fought so many Whig battles together that I think I know all the impulses and
                    inclinations of his mind."</p>
            <p>If Lincoln should be elected, he felt confident that the present status of slavery could not be
                    changed during the next four years. There was no necessity for a Wilmot Proviso. Nobody supposed it
                    possible for slavery to go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Peak. "Stand our ground firmly," he concluded,
                    "and eschew all alliances with either party. Let either come to us without bargain or
                    barter, and thus let the world see that the integrity of our motives and the conservatism of our
                    principles have been vindicated."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>In the October election in Indiana most of the old Americans followed Thompson's advice and
                    voted for Lane for governor. He was successful. His vote in 1860 in those counties which had cast a

            </p>
            <p>Thompson's prediction concerning the outcome of the national election proved correct with
                    reference to the Constitutional Union Party. The party polled 588,879 votes in the nation and
                    carried <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    </placeName>. The vote for Bell in Indiana amounted to only 5, 306, about one fourth that received
                    by Fillmore in 1856. The greater part of the Know-Nothing vote in Indiana apparently went to
                    Lincoln. The Republican Party carried Indiana as well as the other states of the Old Northwest. The
                    more conservative men in the North who supported the Constitutional Union ticket in 1860 were now to
                    follow into the Republican ranks. Richard W. Thompson was one of these men.</p>
            <p>The attempt to form a strong national conservative party had failed. Yet it was worth the effort. Of
                    the sincerity of the leaders of the movement there can be no question. They had no selfish ends to
                    serve. Had they succeeded the terrible war might have been averted.</p>
            <p>With the old Union about to be broken into fragments, Thompson proposed a plan whereby a portion of
                    it might be saved. Two days after <placeName>

                    </placeName> adopted her ordinance of secession, he wrote to Governor John Letcher of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> concerning the formation of a closer union of the central belt of states and
                    territories extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Disclaiming any originality for the plan,
                    Thompson declared that he had long cherished the hope that some such arrangement might be
                    accomplished. He had been selected to lay the plan before the proper authorities.</p>
            <p>In the event of dissolution, he believed they would have no difficulty in forming a satisfactory
                    union, leaving the extreme north to indulge in its vagaries alone, and the extreme south to develop
                    its capacity and resources in its own way. He thought that Norfolk, <placeName>

            <p>No one had tried harder than Thompson during the ten years before the Civil War to prevent the great
                    catastrophe. But the war came. There was no hesitancy upon his part as to what course to follow.
                    Though he loved the South and his native state of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, he loved the Union more. The four years of the war were the busiest of his long life.
                    In 1862 he was appointed by Governor Oliver P. Morton as commandant of Camp Dick Thompson at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1863 he was appointed by President Lincoln to the post of Provost Marshal.</p>
            <p>The ten years following the Civil War were spent by Colonel Thompson in the comparative quiet of his
                    country home at <geogName>Spring Hill</geogName>. Here he devoted much time to reading and literary
                    pursuits. His interest in politics remained as keen as ever. He became a familiar figure in the
                    state and national conventions of the Republican Party. In 1868, as chairman of the committee on
                    resolutions, he wrote the national platform of the Republican Party. In 1877 Thompson became
                    Secretary of the Navy in the Cabinet of President Hayes, a cabinet noted for the ability of its
                    members. The navy was at that time weak but Thompson introduced many reforms which paved the way for
                    the development of the New Navy in later years.</p>
            <p>In 1880 Thompson was appointed chairman of the American Committee of the French Panama Canal Company,
                    a position which he held until 1889. The company became involved in financial difficulties which
                    called forth a congressional investigation. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>During the next two decades, as Harding was growing to maturity in southeastern Indiana, slavery,
                    instead of subsiding, continued to spread until the domestic slave system had firmly intrenched
                    itself in the economic life of the southern States. It was near the close of these two decades, or
                    in the fall of 1828, that young Harding dedicated his life to the abolition of domestic slavery in

                            occasion I should mentally quote the words of the author of American Independence,
                            "I tremble for my country when I consider that God is just, and that His justice

                    to the East, spending a part of the time among relatives at his former home in Palmyra, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> While in Palmyra, he met Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, in
                    whose home he was a guest over night and heard read the first four chapters of the Book of Mormon
                    which was at that very time in the process of being published in a Palmyra printing shop.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Smith tried to prevail upon Harding to remain in Palmyra until the Book of
                    Mormon was completed after which Harding would be sent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a missionary for the newly created Mormon church. This opportunity was rejected.
                    Just what influence this trip to the East had on Harding with respect to slavery is not known. Only
                    this is known, that, being widely traveled for a youth of his backward Indiana community, Harding at
                    once stood out among his neighbors as a leader.</p>
            <p>He began in 1830 to follow closely the trend of the slavery controversy. He subscribed to a number of
                    anti-slavery periodicals as well as other journals of his day. Almost from their first issue Harding
                    received the <hi rend="i">True American</hi>, published at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, by
                    Cassius M. Clay, and the <hi rend="i">Philanthropist</hi>, published at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, 1836-1847, by Gamaliel Bailey, Jr. From these papers he drew while yet a
                    young man ideas on universal liberty, gradual emancipation, and the elevation of labor morally and
                    politically. After 1840 Harding reached out beyond his own state and neighboring states for his
                    ideas, supporting such anti-slavery publications as the <hi rend="i">Liberator</hi>, William Lloyd
                    Garrison's publication, and the <hi rend="i">National Era</hi>, published by Dr. Gamaliel
                    Bailey. There is every evidence that Harding, because of his impetuous nature might have been as
                    radical as Garrison had he been reached by the Garrisonian literature soon after his return from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> when he was but twenty years old. But, as the following letter from Harding to Garrison
                    printed on the front page of the <hi rend="i">Liberator</hi> of April 7, 1843, will show, the
                    attention of Harding was not attracted to Garrison's paper before March, 1843.</p>

                                    We, in the Far West, are beginning to feel the vast importance attached to this
                                    question of slavery, and all admit that the question, however
                                    ‘exciting’ and ‘delicate’ it may be,
                                    cannot longer be stove off. The signs of the time are truly portentous as it regards
                                    this question; and that the American people should have tamely submitted to the
                                    ‘overseership’ which has heretofore been resorted to by the
                                    interested ‘clique’, in order to stifle the groans of millions
                                    in this ‘land of liberty’, is as astonishing to the reflecting
                                    man, as its tendency is alarming to the lover of his country. A week since, I
                                    learned the fate of the GREAT PETITION from your State, and noted especially the
                                    dignified epithets which a few slaveholding and soul-buying ruffians applied to it,
                                    and to that ‘wonderful man’ who had the honor of trying to
                                    present it. I have asked myself, what will the descendents of the Pilgrims say of
                                    the epithets, ‘nigger’, ‘slaves’,
                                    ‘runaway slaves’, ‘smut machine’,
                                    &amp;c, &amp;c. as applied to their Petition, bearing the humble requests of
                                    62, 000 of her ‘free sons and daughters’. Well, we shall see

            <p>Harding hearkened to the published opinions of prominent men on the subject of slavery and discovered
                    that even in the South abolition sentiment had been tolerated. Slaveholders and free farmers not
                    infrequently admitted that slavery was an evil.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> In an old leather law account
                    book, Harding pasted numerous newspaper clippings giving accounts of speeches on the slavery
                    question made by prominent southerners of Jackson's day.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Undoubtedly
                    these discussions influenced Harding to throw himself into the fight against slavery and helped him
                    to express in words some of the impressions of slavery which he had so recently formed during his
                    brief stay in the South. Among these was a part of a speech delivered by Hon. Charles James Faulkner

                    discussions.</p>
            <p>Determined that slavery was wrong and should be abolished, Harding flung himself into the abolition
                    movement with full force. His line of reasoning was simple, since to him slavery was wrong and a
                    wrong should be righted. It might have been, and probably was, "a gloomy time for the
                    little band of people who believed that slavery was poisonous to the south, hurtful to the north,
                    and dangerous to the Union."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Harding was especially qualified to be a leader in the abolition movement to which he dedicated
                    himself from 1830 forward, He was an omnivorous reader and an eloquent and utterly fearless speaker,
                    He possessed a deep, resounding voice and convincing manner of address.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> He
                    believed firmly in the cause of abolition and fearlessly espoused this cause in southern Indiana at
                    this early day when four-fifths of the people were in sympathy with slavery.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                    The greater portion of the inhabitants, having moved to southern Indiana from slaveholding states,
                    had been reared to regard the rights of the slave owner to his slave as sacred as his rights to his
                    horses, cattle, or any other property.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After 1833 Stephen S. Harding was called upon frequently to address public gatherings in southeastern
                    Indiana. The earliest one of his speeches which is extant was made in 1833 when he was twenty-five
                    years old. On this occasion, Harding addressed a Fourth of July gathering on the subject of
                    intemperance. He could not resist the temptation to introduce into this speech the evil of slavery,
                    and to link it with intemperance as one of the two great evils undermining the sacred principles of
                    the people of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Throughout the speech Harding graphically portrayed the ravages accompanying intemperance. It was
                    near the close that he introduced the subject of slavery: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Harding, as well as other anti-slavery leaders, "discovered the usefulness of organized

                    </placeName> which organized the Anti-Slavery Society of America. Certainly to connect himself with
                    such a convention would have been entirely in keeping with his belief in the policy of organized
                    effort. The following is from a speech of 1833: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Societies for the purpose of promoting these great causes of Benevolence (intemperance and
                            slavery reform) have already been formed not only in our own country but throughout
                            Christendom, and the great and good of both Hemispheres are concentrating their moral

            </p>
            <p>The next earliest preserved speech was made about 1834. This confines itself entirely to the subject
                    of slavery. In tune with the style of oratory of that day, this address is very flowery and draws a
                    fanciful picture of the horrors of an enslaved man. According to this speech, Harding's
                    cherished desire was to see the citizens of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> awakened and determined to bring about the eradication of this great evil of our
                    country. To him the fallacy of the framers of the Constitution in causing that document so to read
                    as to seem to recognized slavery in the states where it existed<hi rend="sup">30</hi> was a dark
                    blot on our history. He remembered, however, the circumstances under which the compromises of the
                    Constitution were made, and recalled Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s question, "Is it possible to deliberate between anarchy and
                    confusion on one side, and the chances of good on the other?", and mingled charity with his
                    censure.</p>
            <p>By 1842, Harding had joined the fight against the extension of slavery into the territories. The
                    ornate style of his former speeches was now replaced by a more practical treatment of the subject of
                    slavery. He advocated, on this occasion, free speech and open discussion of the subject of slavery.

                    death and an agreement with Hell involving both parties in atrocious criminality and should be

                    Harding voted with the Whig party, yet in this declaration we see a crystallization of
                    Harding's ideas as expressed in his speeches from 1840 to 1850.</p>
            <p>The ambiguities in the Constitution regarding slavery, Harding thought to be only a temporary
                    toleration by the framers as an expedient to bind together the thirteen colonies during the
                    formative period of the Union, with the expectation that in time the institution of slavery would
                    run its course in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and be automatically abandoned as an economically unsound institution. Harding always
                    spoke at length in driving home to his hearers the argument that slave labor was uneconomical, as
                    well as degrading to slave and master alike. As Harding's speech made in 1849 shows, he
                    followed the moderate abolitionists like Salmon P. Chase, William Jay, Joshua R. Giddings and James
                    G. Birney, as against extremists like William Lloyd Garrison.</p>
            <p>Over a period of fifteen years, from 1833 until 1849, Harding developed into an able anti-slavery
                    leader, lining up with representative men of the middle and western states, hoping to lead his
                    section of Indiana to victory over slavery. As a reward for this growth and leadership, Harding
                    became a leader in state politics on the tickets of the Liberty and Free- <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Proud, ambitious, a highly sensitive being, Harding knew to the fullest extent the unpopularity of
                    the cause he espoused. The space about the courthouse, where he was to speak, was filled with
                    auditors. Some were armed. There was a determination that Harding should not speak. Upon the
                    courthouse was painted on black muslin, "Treason, treason, the Union dissolved this day by
                    the abolitionists." Personal friends tried to dissuade Harding from speaking. According to
                    his own report, one friend said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </placeName> made converts of some of the strongest and most able men in southern Indiana, who
                    remained loyal to the cause of anti-slavery until slavery was abolished. At the time of this address
                    in 1844, Harding was undoubtedly one of the best informed men of Indiana upon the slavery question,
                    having followed closely the sentiments of the abolition and pro-slavery leaders since 1830. In
                    facing an Indiana audience in 1844, Harding had to bear in mind that his fellow citizens of Indiana
                    had but a superficial knowledge of the slavery question. To them it was an institution necessary and
                    natural. Any attempt to overthrow it was considered by them radical and even treasonable. They
                    believed it to bear the sanction of the American constitution. As a result of this feeling, founded
                    on sentiment rather than on logic, Harding by many of his public utterances, brought down on his own
                    head the ire of the people. He had high hopes that once the people of Indiana were informed on the
                    slavery question, they would rally to the cause of anti-slavery, the torch of which he held aloft
                    among his benighted neighbors.</p>
            <p>Slavery, in 1844, was still firmly upheld by both major political parties, Democrats and Whigs. On
                    the evening before Harding delivered his speech at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName> both the major parties held meetings and resolved that Harding should not be permitted

                    seemed to dominate all departments of the Federal Government.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Freedom of the
                    press and freedom of speech were but a mockery. Harding yielded to no party at the expense of his
                    code of ethics. He once advised: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            was introduced to the Rev. Mr. Kavanaugh,—He was a natural orator, and I was so
                            informed before I met him. At first I wished I had not gone there, but the more I thought
                            about it, the more my courage rose, and at last I felt eager for the fray to begin. The
                            Quakers there told me, ‘he is worthy of thy steel’, and I found him
                            so…. Kavanaugh was full of brilliant, dashing rhetoric. I closed the discussion.

                    with Stephen C. Stevens as the nominee for governor. Stevens also was a southern Indiana man. He had
                    served in both houses of the Legislature and on the supreme court of Indiana. In 1826 and 1828 he
                    was elected as senator from <placeName>

            <p>In the presidential campaign of 1852, Harding voted for the Free Soil candidates for President and
                    Vice-president. Indiana had become a more important factor in the General Free Soil movement by
                    1852. George W. Julian who had been elected to the national House by Free Soilers and Democrats in
                    1849 and who later became a Republican leader in Indiana was selected as the running mate of John
                    Parker Hale in the presidential campaign of 1852.</p>
            <p>Harding was one of the eleven presidential electors on the Free-Soil ticket in 1852 representing the
                    fourth congressional district. Stephen C. Stevens and James H. Cravens were the two electors at
                    large from the state.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

                    night of July 12 in order to perfect on organization which could handle the crowd which had
                    assembled. It was estimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 people, of all political affiliations,

            <p>As the October election in Indiana drew near, the People's Party (Republican) leaders in the
                    state were confident of success, but the returns showed a Democratic victory. When the November
                    election came on for presidential electors, Indiana went Democratic by about 20, 000. The
                    Republicans, however, did carry five of the eleven Congressional districts, all in the northern part
                    of the state. This seemed to draw a line in Indiana, making northern Indiana more anti-slavery than
                    southern Indiana.</p>
            <p>Harding saw in the birth of the new party a great possibility of stamping out slavery. He had been
                    prominently identified with the anti-slavery parties since 1840, when he had left the Whig party. He
                    had been a candidate for state offices on the Liberty Party ticket. He was devoted to the cause of
                    the destruction of the institution of slavery and was aware that he could not promote this cause by
                    further adherence to the old anti-slavery political organization. The platform opposing the
                    extension of slavery lured Harding into the Republican ranks, and made of him an active promoter of
                    the Republican cause in Indiana. From first to last, Harding changed his party allegiance only when
                    he saw a better chance to strike at slavery.</p>
            <p>The Republican national platform of 1856 opposed those "twin relics of
                    barbarism,—polygamy and slavery", and declared it to be the constitutional right
                    and imperative duty of Congress to prohibit these in the territories. On the subject of polygamy,
                    Harding was now rabid. He and Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, had been boys together in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> state. Harding believed Mormonism to be a hoax and welcomed the chance to vote against
                    polygamy in the election of 1856.</p>
            <p>In a speech made in the campaign of 1856, Harding divided the Democratic party into three classes:
                    office holders and office hunters and their dependents; the descendents of the so-called,
                    "F.F's" (first families) of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and other slave- <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-027-3-045"/> holding states; and a last group
                    of honest men, not yet aroused against slavery. In regard to the last two classes Harding remarked:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>To convince this [second] class of Democrats that there was anything wrong in the relation of

                            quite as hopeless a task as to convince a freezing man under a clear and frosty sky there is

            <p>Defeat in the state and national elections of 1856 did not discourage the members of the
                    People's Party (new Republican party). In 1857 and 1858 they strengthened their party
                    organization and succeeded in the state election of 1858 in winning seven of the eleven
                    Congressional districts in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>

            <p>From 1856 to 1860 the feeling of opposition to the extension of slavery remained strong, not only in
                    Indiana but throughout the North. One evidence of this growth was the Republican state nominating
                    convention held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    capital. So great was the crowd that it was decided to move to the state house yard. The state
                    ticket was selected and delegates were chosen for the national Republican convention at <placeName>

                            campaign of 1866. In this booklet Harding draws a comparison between the Democratic party of
                            1882 and that of 1866, arguing that the Democratic party had become a purely slave party as

            <p>A few years ago, when Pendleton, Indiana, held its Centennial Celebration and Home-coming, the story
                    of the massacre of Indians by some pioneer settlers of that locality was retold. Afterwards large
                    city papers presented the account as an historical news feature. Writers have a very impersonal way
                    of digging up these old tales and giving them out to a sensation-mad public, failing to realize that
                    all the people touched by the crime do not die with the perpetrators. The living generation is
                    frequently confronted with articles and pictures reviewing fully past crimes in their worst details.
                    Such publicity is often a source of great humiliation to many worthy persons. This article is
                    written with no intention to vindicate the murders of 1824, but it seems only fair when any crime of
                    a past period is being reviewed to make public all the things that have a bearing on the situation.
                    Often there are cases, as Sir Roger De Coverly was prone to hold, when "Much can be said on
                    both sides."</p>
            <p>The tale of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> massacre is more or less familiar to all who have read the old stories of Indiana.
                    There are enough thrills in it to last the average individual the rest of his natural lifetime.
                    Briefly stated, it is to the effect that, in February, 1824, a visiting citizen from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Thomas Harper, led three Indiana pioneers, James Hudson, Andrew Sawyer and John
                    Townsend Bridge, the group being accompanied by a son of the latter (John Bridge), to an Indian camp
                    on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> near Pendleton where they killed two adult Indian men, two squaws, two boys and two
                    small girls.</p>
            <p>Harper, who was the instigator of the crime escaped and was never apprehended. The others were
                    brought to trial. Hudson was tried, convicted in October and hanged in December, 1824, several
                    months before the others. Some days after conviction, in the spring of 1825, Sawyer and the two
                    Bridges were brought to the place of execution, where each awaited his turn seated on his own
                    coffin. Sawyer and the elder Bridge were disposed of in the presence of a great Crowd, including
                    Indians from far and near, and the noose was adjusted about the neck of the younger Bridge who was
                        <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-027-3-049"/> only eighteen years of age. The boy had the sympathy of the
                    assembled multitude. Having just witnessed the execution of his father and uncle, he was nearly
                    demented with grief and fear. At the last minute, Governor James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> Ray, after a most spectacular ride, arrived with a pardon for the youth.</p>
            <p>Although Indiana was undoubtedly right in the punishment meted out, still the details of a crime and
                    the fulfillment of legal justice do not constitute the entire story, no matter how thoroughly the
                    reading public may enjoy that part of the tale. An event of pioneer days should not be viewed
                    through the same lens that is used in the case of a modern racket war. To thoroughly understand
                    anything of an historical nature, it must be placed in the correct setting as to time, place,
                    persons, motives, and the customs of the day. So far, not much has been said about the personality
                    or motives of the men implicated, so that must be supplied by family tradition and verified as fully
                    as possible by various histories.</p>
            <p>Of the man Hudson, not much is known except that histories tell us he had "a mean
                    look", which may account for the fact that he was tried and hanged a few weeks before the
                    other men. An eye witness of the trial (Oliver H. Smith) says that the elder Bridge and Sawyer
                    looked like ordinary pioneer farmers, the former of whom served on the Grand Jury in 1823, and
                    frequently went into the settlement for supplies. His name was John Townsend Bridge. He was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the Revolutionary Wiir. His father was Samuel Bridge of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, who was a soldier of the Revolution. Hudson's <hi rend="i">History of <placeName>

               </hi> mentions the marriage of a Samuel Bridge and Hannah Townsend. If John Townsend

                    Bridge has never been found owing to the fact that many records were lost during the siege of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> Tragedy is mentioned in connection with a John Harper, and the statement is made that
                    it was in retaliation for the massacre of some of the Harper family years before. Also, during the
                    War of 1812, one of the Harpers was killed at the River Raisin. It will be recalled that General
                    Winchester (American) surrendered with the promise of British protection. General Proctor (British)
                    withdrew, however, leaving the American soldiers at the mercy of the Indian warriors who were allies
                    of the British. The redmen began their work with tomahawk and scalping-knife, fired the building
                    that housed the wounded, and hurled back into the flames all who tried to escape. So demoniac was
                    the slaughter that the words "Remember the Raisin", became a slogan of the
                    Americans. It was this stirring battle cry that spurred General Harrison's men to their
                    most determined effort.</p>
            <p>Another event that stirred the Harper family most profoundly was the kidnaping of a little girl whose
                    fate was still a matter of horrible conjecture at the time the settlers reeked their vengeance on
                    the Indians along <placeName>

                    three years old. It was maple sugar time and the Indians had come into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> settlement either to watch the boiling of the sap or to engage in making syrup for
                    themselves. One squaw in particular seemed to greatly fancy the little white girl. The next day
                    Elizabeth disappeared while following the older children who went forth to drive home the cows.
                    Moccasin tracks were seen near a stream, but although the settlers searched frantically, no trace of
                    Elizabeth was discovered. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that she was found forty years later,

                            that he married Mary Harper. Since Sawyer was a brother-in-law of Bridge, he probably
                            married a sister of Mary Harper. Thus both Sawyer and Bridge were relations of the Thomas

            <p>The Harpers "nursed their wrath to keep it warm" and a great hatred for the Indians
                    was developed in the breast of each member of the family. Such was the condition when the Thomas

                    ostensibly friendly, visit was paid to the camp. The tradition is that one of the Indians displayed
                    a number of white scalps.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> If so, this all too vividly recalled the fact that
                    some of the Harpers had suffered from savage scalping knives.</p>
            <p>There is also a tradition to the effect that a settler's wife had been attacked by an

                    pioneer's hospitality on such occasions was judged by the amount of whiskey dispensed, that
                    may account somewhat for the brutality of the crime. Whether right or wrong, there is no denying the
                    fact that whiskey, as well as quinine, played a part in the settlement of a new state.</p>

            <p>Anyone who loves and reads pioneer history has observed the fact that there were frequent massacres
                    of Indians by the Whites. A most notable case was the slaughter of nearly a hundred praying Indians
                    in a Moravian Church in Guadenheutten, <placeName>

                    terrible event, remarks that "It was thought no worse to slay an Indian than to shoot a
                    wolf, and the children of the redmen were but wolf cubs whose appetites and fangs were not yet

            <p>Indiana was a very young state, and mortally afraid of the Indians. She was also afraid of the Indian
                    Agents who were at last becoming very active in protecting the Indians in order to keep them
                    peaceful. It is a well known fact that redmen from all over the state were brought in by the
                    Government to witness the executions of 1824-5. The Agent pointed out to them repeatedly that it was
                    thus the Great White Father punished their enemies. An Indian's life was protected but it
                    was a long time before it was valued by anyone but himself. It seems to have been the irony of fate
                    that the men who were executed in 1825, were punished for a deed that had not before been considered
                    a crime by many pioneers, regardless of the laws.</p>

                    1855. About 200 of the letters, among them those by William Howard Taft, Albert J. Beveridge and a
                    few by Theodore Roosevelt, are to be sealed for a time. With this exception the collection is

                    </placeName>, had married her sister, Lydia Jane. When he was elected state treasurer he moved to
                    Corydon and to him fell the task of moving the stout treasury box and the other goods and chattels
                    of the government to the new capital. Mary Catherine and her brother, William Anderson, apparently
                    decided to share their sister's fortunes in the wilderness capital and so joined the little
                    party conducted by Mr. Merrill.</p>
            <p>Only two years later, in 1826, Mary Catherine married Isaac Naylor, a veteran of many Indian battles

                    </placeName> where Mr. Naylor quickly became active in civic affairs. A few years later he began his

                        us. Four of the horses were white, the fifth gray, called the lead horse. Mr. Siebert was proud
                        of his horses, well he might be. I have, I think, never seen as grand a team. Yet I could not
                        ride in the wagon, as it was covered, and made me sick; but my sister and her children rode all
                        the way to <placeName>

                        </placeName>. I walked the eleven miles of our first day's journey.</p>
                    <p>The house where we spent the first night was a good looking frame house. I think the landlord had
                        a saw mill near. Here I must digress a little. Mr. John Douglass was State Printer at that time
                        and they moved with us. Mrs. Douglass had three children. They rode in their wagon all the way.
                        Mr. Douglass had a horse that he rode. They had a cow tied to the back of the wagon. When the
                        roads became very bad, they loosed the cow, and she was sure to run to the woods. I would mount
                        his horse and ride for the cow, and bring her back. Well, I will return to that first night.</p>
                    <p>When we entered the house, Mrs. Douglass, being very tired, from holding her babe, laid him on
                        the bed. The woman screamed: "Take that child off my bed, for it has the
                        itch." We all felt indignant and yet felt funny, for Mrs. Douglass always kept her
                        little ones clean, of all skin diseases. Part of us slept on the floor.</p>
                    <p>The young lady of the house had a young man visiting her. They sat up late in the room that we
                        were huddled in. They sat by the fire all night on opposite sides of the fireplace, never moving
                        up. He wore a coon-skin [cap] with the tail attached, and little Jane Merrill thought he was a
                        bear. Not a word was spoken by either of the lovers; they only gazed at each other.</p>
                    <p>We were, I think, ten days on our way.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The treasury box was large and
                        strong. Whether there was much money in it, I cannot say; but I think not much. This box had to
                        have a place in this large wagon, indeed wherever we or the Merrill family went, this box was
                        sure to go. I do not remember about stopping at night after the first night. I presume we did. I
                        know my sister looked very tired. She had the care of the children in the wagon. The youngest
                        one, Catharine, whenever she would see me, would put out her hands for me to take her. I would
                        carry her awhile. She did not like the jolting, and she may have been sick. 1 was too sick when
                        riding to take any care of the children; but they were as good as could be. They did not cry.</p>
                    <p>The road was laid with rails or logs for miles, then covered with water that seemed bottomless.
                        When the horses and wagon would go down, it seemed they might have reached <placeName>

                        and a half only, The water lay in the road too deep to venture in and trees had to be felled to
                        make a road around. Once, Mr. Douglass's wagon stuck fast, and had to be pried out. The
                        next morning after traveling that short distance, Mr. Merrill said when we were ready to start;

                        </placeName>, as it was raining; which it did after the first day almost every day. When near <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                        </placeName>, Mr. Merrill insisted on my riding in the wagon; the first thing I knew he lifted
                        me into the wagon. I sat there until we reached the hotel, which looked fine with a handsome
                        sign. We had a tolerable supper. Mr. Siebert declared the tea was made of the water that eggs
                        had been cooked in.</p>
                    <p>I do not remember how we were dressed. I know we were quite decent looking when we reached <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                        </placeName>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Siebert had a fashion of putting bells on his horses whenever we came near a town. We begged
                        him to leave them off when he drove into <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                        </placeName>; but he wouldn't consent. So we went into the seat of government with
                        fine, large, strong horses strung will bells, all ringing. The sound brought the good people out
                        to stare at us. I was glad to be in a covered wagon at that time. We all stopped at Blake
                        &amp; Henderson's Hotel, where we had an excellent supper; and we certainly did
                        justice to it. We went that night to a room (frame) without lathing or plastering. The weather
                        had become cold, so that it was not easy to keep warm although we had a rousing fire.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Merrill had rented a cottage on West <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                        </placeName> street, but Mr. Calvin Fletcher was living in it, and couldn't move out
                        for some time; for he could not find an empty house. So he offered us a room, there being but
                        two rooms in the house. We took the one farthest from a summer kitchen. For us to get into this
                        kitchen we had to go out of the front door, and then either climb a rail fence or pass through
                        Mrs. Fletcher's room. In our room we had the treasury box. One morning my sister took
                        up the ashes from the fireplace in the kitchen, putting them in a barrel, embers being in the
                        ashes, burning slowly all day. In the night, I awoke from the light shining on me, and the
                        kitchen burned with its contents. Everything was carried out of the house into the middle of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                        </placeName> street with a clean deep snow to rest on while the fire was put out. However, in a
                        few weeks, Mr. Fletcher moved out, and we felt as if we were living in a mansion. I think we
                        were as happy with our surroundings as we are now.</p>

                    <p>The journey of about one hundred and sixty miles occupied two weeks. The best day's
                        travel was eleven miles. One day the wagons accomplished but two miles, passages through the
                        woods having to be cut on account of the impassable character of the road. Four four-horse
                        wagons and one or two saddle horses formed the means of conveyance for the two families,
                        consisting of about a dozen persons, and for a printing press and the state treasury of silver
                        in strong wooden boxes. The gentlemen slept in the wagons or on the ground to protect the
                        silver, the families found shelter at night in log cabins which stood along the road at rare
                        though not inconvenient intervals. The country people <pb n="243" id="VAA4025-027-3-061"/> were,
                        many of them, as rude as their dwellings, which usually consisted of but one room, serving for
                        all the purposes of domestic life,—cooking, eating, sleeping, spinning and weaving,
                        and the entertainment of company. At one place a young man, who perhaps had come miles to visit
                        his sweetheart, sat up with her all night on the only vacant space in the room, the hearth of
                        the big fireplace. He kept on his cap, which was of coonskin, the tail hanging down behind, and
                        gave the children the impression that he was a bear.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    </placeName>, where his father was a shoemaker and a small farmer. In the spring of 1853, when
                    twenty-three years of age, he set out for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> with the hope of making his fortune. An older brother, Edward Cook, who lived in the
                    new state, made that distant frontier seem less remote. The young adventurer, instead of making the
                    trip by land, chose the water route by way of the Isthmus of Panama, at that time very widely
                    advertised, although the isthmian railroad had not yet been built.</p>
            <p>No record of the trip remains save that his brother met him at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> and together they went to Stockton where the older brother had staked out a claim.
                    Evidently the gold did not "pan out" very well for the young fortune hunter. A
                    letter written to his father and mother on October 28, 1853, shows him somewhat disillusioned and
                    homesick but still hopeful of making his "pile".<hi rend="sup">2</hi> He then
                    expected to remain from two to five years, but he was back in his <geogName>Berkshire

                    desirable land and setting up for himself. He raised garden produce, small fruits and kept bees.</p>
            <p>Then came the Civil War. President Lincoln's call for volunteers, in July of 1862, met with
                    an indifferent response in some sections of Indiana and 3000 men remained to be drafted in order to
                    complete the quota for the state. Each township was apportioned its share with the provision that
                    further volunteers would reduce the number to be drafted. On August 11th, Charles N. Cook
                    volunteered and exchanged his overalls and hoe for the blue uniform and rifle of a private soldier.
                    Evenually he was assigned to the 99th Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, Company K. and served three
                    years in that regiment and company.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName> Ball. One day when Ball was writing to his sister Margaret, Cook expressed a wish to
                    write to her also although he had never met her. He was known to Miss Ball by reputation and the
                    request for permission to write to her was granted. His first message was a few lines written at the
                    end of the brother's next letter. This was answered promptly. There followed a long and,
                    most of the time, a very happy correspondence. The letters which were written in camp, while on the
                    march and even during quiet intervals on the battle field were preserved. The collection, now in the

                                    very good only I feel a little like the ague today, we have had some pretty frosty
                                    nights the past week &amp; we feel the need of beds, yet I suppose we will have
                                    to get used to it. I recd your letter yesterday &amp; was very glad to hear from
                                    home once more. Now Marg. cant you write a little oftener. I want you to write soon
                                    as you get this. Charles C. [Cook] has his bunk with me &amp; asks me [to] give
                                    his respects to my sister, &amp; says if he was acquainted he would put in a few
                                    lines. O Marg. you cannot think what a wicked place a camp is. it seems as if young
                                    men lose all respect [for] themselves &amp; their maker, at a time when they
                                    ought to reflect &amp; consider their ways &amp; have impressed on their
                                    minds the awful realities of an endless eternity, they are most reckless &amp;
                                    careless. O time what art thou &amp; Death what canst thou give that poor frail
                                    mortals like us should exchange for thee an inheritance incorruptible &amp; that
                                    fadeth not away. O that we might comprehend it &amp; learn to love &amp;
                                    adore the great creator, &amp; that I may never be led to profane his holy name
                                    but rather to speak his name in prayer &amp; praise. in camp one is surrounded
                                    by a great many temptations &amp; if he has not strength given from him on high
                                    it will be impossible <pb n="246" id="VAA4025-027-3-064"/> to resist. I have no more
                                    to write at present, please answer this soon as you can &amp; direct as before
                                    in care of Capt. Julian.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sister Marg.</salute>
                        <p>We are now in our winter quarters. still this does not imply that it is to be our
                                    home for the coming winter. I would it might. we left camp Joe Reynolds yesterday.
                                    this is a new camp situated on a beautiful rise of ground commanding a fine view of
                                    the city and surrounding country, the barracks are very comfortable, much more so
                                    than those we formerly occupied. they are divided into rooms about 16 feet square
                                    each of which are occupied by 25 men. there is also a stove for each room &amp;
                                    one window, the bunks are three deep and two sleep in each, we now have plenty of
                                    straw &amp; sleep very comfortable. how long we will stop is a matter of
                                    uncertainty. a soldier knows not the hour he may be called upon to strap his
                                    knapsack to his back &amp; take up a line of march. I feel more than ever a
                                    soldier's life is one of great sacrifice. still I cannot regret the step I
                                    have taken. if heaven born liberty is worth no self denial to maintain it it is
                                    worth nothing. I have no reason to complain we have not as yet been called upon to
                                    suffer much hardship. the weather still continues beautiful. it is very smoky. I
                                    think we may look for cold weather soon, our company is not yet full and nothing has
                                    been done since I returned. Bill Jones came into camp yesterday. last night two of
                                    the boys deserted &amp; if something is not done soon halfe of them will leave.
                                    I will stay here until the result is known. I wish I had some of those fine apples
                                    you spoke of. they would be quite a luxury in camp. we had a great time after the
                                    boys got back as starved set of mortals as you ever saw. the cook was too slow for
                                    their appetites so every one grabbed for himself. the cook got mad &amp;
                                    wouldn't serve &amp; each one turned cook for himself, you would have
                                    laughed to see the fun. some got double rations &amp; others none. I am happy to
                                    say our cook is reinstated in his laudable occupation &amp; in order that
                                    justice may be done each one draws his daily ration of bread. I hoped to have some
                                    encouraging news in reference to our company to write in this but have not. we will
                                    know in a few days what disposal is to be made with us. I think we will be disbanded
                                    &amp; go into other regiments or home at our own option. I will go home
                                    &amp; feel justified in it. we was deceived in the first place &amp; have
                                    been ever since &amp; now I think they have forfeited all claim to us. I have no
                                    more to write at present. you may expect to hear from me in a few days soon as our
                                    com[pany] is mustered or disbanded. write soon as you receive this, once more
                                    farewell from your affecate bro.</p>

                        <p>Shall I open the few words I desire to write &amp; send you with an apology? I
                                    trust your liberality of feeling will not demand it. we have hitherto been
                                    strangers. is that any reason why [we] should be so in the future ? I think not.
                                    perhaps I am breaking the ordinary rules of formalities. I hate formalities, give me
                                    the outgushings of an honest heart, give me a being whose soul is unblemished with
                                    vain pride and whose mind is pure &amp; who cares not for the scandal of the
                                    world. one who loves the works of nature &amp; loves to look up from nature to
                                    nature's God. there is such a friend I want.</p>
                        <p>Camp life does not suit we very well. I have not been used to hear so much profanity.
                                    to hear the name of Him who created us &amp; gives us our being in whom we are

                                    would be wrong to complain. Oh how dark &amp; fearful is the prospect of the new
                                    year that is soon to dawn upon us, how many of us will live to tell the sad tale of
                                    war &amp; desolation that threatens us, God only knows, we are in his hands, he

                                    the wicked kill the body they have no power harm the soul. Several hundred of
                                    paroled prisoners just went past our camp to camp Noble. they just arrived from the
                                    south. Our prospects for whipping the rebels is not very encouraging at present [end

                                    them were detected in a plot to take possession of our guns but the scamps are caged
                                    &amp; hope they will be severely dealt with. I wish this war might end and we be
                                    permitted to go to our homes. I am glad to say there is less profanity in our
                                    quarters than formerly as some of the worst of our company are absent and there are
                                    three or four that I never want to see again.</p>

                                    have no claims of the least notice on your part to my letters as I must plead guilty
                                    as an intruder yet my intentions are innocent from any dishonest purpose. Every
                                    thing comes from an honest heart.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Maggie:</salute>
                        <p>I am going to sit down this afternoon and enjoy the privelege of penning you a few
                                    lines. Oh it is so kind in you to notice my poor letters, my heart flows with
                                    gratitude. I want to thank you for the picture I think a great deal of it &amp;
                                    I would not part with it for anything. the other present was very acceptable we dont
                                    get such nice things in camp very often. I hope to be fortunate enough to get a wife
                                    that can make cakes &amp; pies as nice, but I want one that has a sweet
                                    &amp; lovely disposition for she will be my main dependence for society. when I
                                    was a boy under my father's roof I used to spend most of my time at home
                                    &amp; sought the enjoyments of home. now I am a thousand miles away from those
                                    familiar scenes. my only sister has long since been called to the skies, she had a
                                    lovely disposition. the elder of my only two brothers died in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                                    </placeName> in the spring of 1856, &amp; my only brother not quite two years
                                    older than myself joined the army on the Potomac &amp; has been lost to us since
                                    early in the month of March &amp; my dear parents have no child but me. Now
                                    Maggie you will not wonder I sometimes get lonely &amp; sad. you will not wonder
                                    I want to find "some kindred spirit fitly strung to echo back the tones of
                                    mine".</p>
                        <p>Maggie I want to see you very much &amp; if we stop here long enough I will try
                                    to get a furlough &amp; visit you. I came near going the last time, but thought
                                    it best to wait until I got well, my eyes are very weak yet, <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-027-3-067"/> otherwise I am well, I dont think we will leave here
                                    for some time, some troops are needed at home to keep down the traitors at home. I
                                    have an idea this war will be over soon. The boys got back safe &amp; sound only
                                    Carter. his mumps are not as well &amp; he went over to the hospital. Laf.
                                    [Ball] was rather tired when he got to camp he bunked with me last night…
                                    it is rather airey to sleep on a board with a small handful of straw &amp; only
                                    one thickness of blanket under you. you know we soldiers dont get things as nice
                                    here as at home. I shall want to hear you play some nice tunes on the accordion when
                                    I come to see you. you may depend I will come if I can. if any of the home guard
                                    should ask you to marry them, tell such ones that you are <hi rend="i">waiting for a
                                        soldier.</hi> forgive me for such an expression I mean no harm.</p>
                        <p>I want to hear from you again soon. you can find enough to write any thing from you
                                    will interest me. give my best respects to you father &amp; mother &amp;
                                    remember me.</p>

                        <salute>My Dear Friend</salute>
                        <p>Maggie It is with feelings of great pleasure I sit down to drop you a few lines this
                                    afternoon. yours of Jany <hi rend="i">30th</hi> was kindly recd today. I will try to
                                    tell you something of our prospects for the future. the dark clouds that have so
                                    long shut out the bright sunbeams of our once happy existence now and then nearly
                                    overwhelming us with a fearful forbodings of the future seems for the present to be
                                    gradually dispelled…</p>
                        <p>It is not natural for man to run into danger unless a sense of duty leads him to it,
                                    &amp; if Uncle Sam should conclude to keep our company here for the protection
                                    of our own homes it would be far better for us than the hardships of a southern
                                    campaign. I know that you would rejoice to hear that your dear brother had escaped
                                    the exposures of disease &amp; in a measure the bullets of southern traitors.</p>
                        <p>The reason that I have thus written is that at the present time there seems to be a
                                    little prospect that we will be assigned to the 63 d Regt &amp; kept here to
                                    guard rebel prisoners or government property. Yet it is a matter of uncertainity. we
                                    must wait &amp; time will soon reveal to us the future &amp; we must be
                                    prepared to for wherever duty calls.</p>
                        <p>Once more has our camp been called upon to be in readiness for an expected skirmish.
                                    last sunday night as I got home from church I found the boys all astir loading their
                                    guns, orders were given from head quarters for every man to sleep with his gun
                                    loaded &amp; his clothes on. the reason for this was the arrest of nine
                                    prisoners in Morgan Co. [Indiana] by a company of cavalry from our camp who went out
                                    there for the purpose of bringing back some 40 deserters of the 1st Cavalry who are
                                    traitors in principle &amp; had combined with some citizens of the same stamp
                                    for the purpose of resisting the laws. it was by some expected an attempt would be
                                    made to release the prisoners who were confined in the <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-027-3-068"/> guard house of this camp. squads of soldiers were
                                    stationed at the most accesible points of the camp on Sunday night, but no
                                    disturbance took place. another squad of Cavalry have gone to Morgan [Co.] to arrest
                                    the balance of the rebels.</p>
                        <p>I will not commence this last page with camp items. there are things I would like to
                                    write but do not feel at liberty. if we should happen to stop here any considerable
                                    length of time I may get a chance to go to Logan [<placeName>

                                    </placeName>] &amp; perhaps to make you a visit. I expect we will get our bounty
                                    soon. your brother will write soon.</p>

                        <p>I suppose you are looking for a letter from me by this time so I will sit down
                                    &amp; write you a few lines this afternoon. we are geting along very well
                                    &amp; are well suited with our new quarters. Our company are at premnt attached
                                    to the 71st Regt on guard duty. we did not go to the soldier's home as we
                                    expected. the duty assigned to us is the guarding of the rebel prisoners about 400
                                    in number. the guard is divided into nine reliefs each one being on duty two hours
                                    out of every 18 or one ninth of the time. I dont mind it in the daytime but to be
                                    called out of bed in the middle of the night is not very pleasant. yet we must look
                                    for some hardships. I recd your letter of the <hi rend="i">28th</hi> of Feby
                                    &amp; was glad to know you was all well. I was somewhat disappointed that Christ
                                    Lindament did not get back as I expected him to bring me something from home. I dont
                                    know but we will get furloughs before long. therefore I will not express any money
                                    at present until I assertain. we were paid off last friday. I think it will be some
                                    time before we leave here. I dont care how long for we are doing very well here. the
                                    weather is quite cool now I hope spring will soon open the bluebirds were singing
                                    this morning, which made it seem like spring.</p>
                        <p>We are not kept as close in camp as when at Camp Carrington the Col seems to be a
                                    nice man &amp; I think if we do right he will be good to us, he says so at any
                                    rate. we are over run with rats here in camp &amp; I dont [know] but they will
                                    take us prisoners our Lieut. caught four in an old boot. there is a bakery in camp
                                    so we get our bread fresh. all our grub is good &amp; we cant complain our
                                    company is in 4 messes &amp; we have two large stoves to cook by, which is much
                                    nicer than out door cooking. we have got a lovely place I know it is beautiful in
                                    summer when the leaves are on the trees. I dont know but I have told you all.
                                    Charley Cook wants to know if Christ. Lindament paid his tax yet he sent money by
                                    him if the boys see him tell them to ask him about it. I have no more at present to
                                    write. Write soon</p>

            <p>Private Cook wrote letters to Miss Margaret Ball from Camp Morton on April 2, April 14, April 25, and
                    May 5, 1863. While at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with little to break the monotony save guard duty and drill, life was rather dull. In
                    his letter of April 14, Cook registered this complaint: "If we ever get away from this dull
                    place, I will have something to write about that will interest you but here it is nothing but drill,
                    drill. I wonder why we must have to stay here while, many or most all of our fellow
                    soldiers… are allowed the privilege of drubing the rebels and the satisfaction of getting
                    their legs and heads shot off while we are bandboxed up here as if we were too nice an article for
                    common use…." Through these weary months but two companies of the 99th Indiana
                    were detained at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the ranks of one of these (Company K), were Privates Cook and Ball. During this
                    dreary period, the love affair between Cook and the girl at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> whom he had never seen progressed rapidly. By April 25, 1863, Cook had reached the
                    stage where he could say in all sincerity: "Maggie you are mine and I am yours and may the
                    attachment that has sprung up in each of our hearts one for the other be the germ that shall bud on
                    earth and blossom in heaven." Not long after this message was penned the two companies were
                    sent to join their regiment at Moscow, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, where they arrived on May 14.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> A little over a week later, Cook
                    wrote a long letter to Miss Ball in which he tried to find some comfort in calculating the time
                    until he should be free: "Only a few short weeks more to the 14th of Aug. and our time will
                    be one third past—only two more years then to serve—&amp; then [also] we
                    have the chance of sooner discharge."</p>
            <p>The last portion of this letter which was begun on May 23, was finished the next day. The young
                    soldier first saw Negro regiments at Moscow, and began to learn from personal observation something
                    about the destructiveness of war: "the devastations of war are visible on every side
                    &amp; the boys of our regt who have but a couple of weeks since returned from a campaign of 200
                    miles through Miss. say it is the case all through the country. farms are laid waste fences are
                    burned."</p>

                    Joseph E. Johnston might not be able to attack Grant's army in the rear and furnish General
                    Pemberton a chance to escape. By June 5th, the brigade to which the 99th Indiana belonged was making

                                    the river. The same evening I sent your last letter just one week ago today, several
                                    regts of infantry &amp; batterys came into Moscow from above &amp; started
                                    on with us the next morning for the river. we had to walk thru as there was not
                                    transportation for us. it took two days, Saturday and Sunday. &amp; it was the
                                    hottest Sunday's work I ever did. our feet were pretty lame when we got
                                    through. the distance we walked was 40 miles. we were fortunate enough to get our
                                    knapsacks hauled. on Sunday we camped on the edge of <placeName>

                                    </placeName> about a mile &amp; halfe from the river. we reached this camping
                                    ground in the middle of the afternoon &amp; remained there until one oclock on
                                    Monday when we marched on to the river &amp; went aboard the steam boat here we
                                    found Chris Lindament &amp; two other of our boys who had just come down the

                                    day about noon. the time seemed short as we had much to see that was interesting.

                                    we landed near where we are now. we are about 12 miles up the <geogName>Yazoo

                                    the timber but no rebels made their appearance. the scenery down the banks of the

                                    full growth. for a good portion of the way the banks are low &amp; sandy,
                                    &amp; the trees are small &amp; so thick that a man could hardly get through
                                    it. when the banks were high we would frequently pass large plantations apparently
                                    deserted. it is a common sight to see the naked chimnies of houses that have been

                                    get ready for picket duty. the notice was so short I did not get the letter mailed,
                                    so I will write a little more before I send it. there is 20 detailed out our company
                                    each day for guard duty. picketing is not here the same as at the north. we know not

                                    on his post the pickets are stationed near two miles out of camp &amp; 20 in a

                                    heaven for shelter. this does tolerable well in summer but in winter &amp; cold
                                    stormy weather I would not envy the berth. yesterday a new picket line was being

                                    able to tell you that it has fallen into our hands. Oh Maggie I carried your
                                    likeness in my bosom with the letter &amp; came near spoiling them with sweat
                                    but the inside of the likeness &amp; the lock of hair was unharmed. Well, I must
                                    close this &amp; get it in the mail. will you write me a long letter soon as you
                                    get this. I love to get just such letters as your last two was &amp; I want
                                    another. Mag. I want you to love me a little better &amp; more every day. I
                                    thank you for sending me that post stamp. I know you love to hear from me &amp;
                                    I do love to write to my love. I do not hear from home yet but hope to
                                    soon—no more but remain your until death. once more Goodbye Maggie</p>

                        <salute>My Dear beloved Maggie</salute>
                        <p>Only five days since I mailed my last letter to my love and find it now as always is
                                    to me a delightful task to take my portfolio on my lap &amp; study up something
                                    to write that I think will interest her. I want you to go in some nice pleasant
                                    place &amp; as you read this just imagine me by your side &amp; just as I
                                    write I would talk to you. as I came from picket duty today the joyful tiding,
                                    "a letter for you Chas. N." O how gladly did I grasp the ever
                                    welcome message for I knew before I opened it that it was from Maggie &amp; she
                                    never writes anything but what I love to read. I went down to the river bank or near
                                    it &amp; selected a shady spot all alone with none to molest me with their
                                    impudent inquisitiveness, a good stock of which some of the boys are possessed with.
                                    I sat there a long while reading your good long letter &amp; watching the
                                    steamboats as they plowed <pb n="255" id="VAA4025-027-3-073"/> their way up and down
                                    the river. while I sat there one boat came up with a regt of soldiers aboard. there
                                    were several boats at the landing being unloaded of army stores these too but a
                                    couple of days since came up the river [Yazoo] loaded down with soldiers wagons
                                    cannon ammunition etc—there has been about 18 boats up with soldiers
                                    since our flat of 13 boats came up. Uncle Samuel is just rushing the troops down
                                    [the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>] to this point &amp; great
                                    preparations are being made for the purpose of keeping the rebs from reinforcing
                                    Pemberton at Vicksburg. everyday we hear the booming of cannon at that place
                                    &amp; at night also. that the rebels are suffering in Vicksburg there can be no
                                    doubt we have them hemmed in and I hope soon to hear they have surrendered. squads
                                    of them come outside at night &amp; try to break through our lines but are drove
                                    back. if we get that place it will be a decisive blow towards closing up this
                                    rebellion. I wish you could look at the miles of breast works that are thrown up
                                    round the brows of the hills facing every point that would be possible for an enemy
                                    to get in at. deep ravines &amp; gullies jut down in every direction
                                    perpendicular precipices from 80 to 100 feet deep are to be seen. I have some
                                    opportunity of seeing some of the country yesterday a lot from our company was sent
                                    out among the advance pickets there were about 1000 all together &amp; we were
                                    put outside of the old line. the fartherest of all from camp it was three miles out
                                    &amp; that was the most fatigueing 3 miles march I ever took. you can hardly
                                    have an idea how oppresively hot it is here &amp; if it were not for an
                                    occasional thunder shower &amp; the refreshing breeze that blows from the river
                                    the heat would be intolerable, our camp is on a sidehill &amp; the sun strikes
                                    the tents so hot that we can hardly stay in them in the heat of the day. we have to
                                    spread our blankets on the grounds as there is not room for bunks we are so crowded.
                                    This is a great country for fruit as I ever saw as we were marching out on the
                                    picket line on both sides of the road we could see the blackberry bushes loaded down
                                    with ripe and red berries &amp; we could not get out to gratify our apetites,
                                    but this morning I managed to get behind &amp; feasted to my heart's
                                    content. yesterday I picked a fine lot of mulberries &amp; stewed them the
                                    country produces the finest quality of plums &amp; it is plum time here now I
                                    long for the peaches to get ripe I am very fond of them. Laf. came in from guard
                                    today he was with some others across the river guarding a lot of cattle that had
                                    been "drafted in", when Uncle Sam wants cattle or mules he sends
                                    his boys out into secessia &amp; they bring in a supply. they also brought in a
                                    lot of darkies. their masters were off fighting against their country, &amp;
                                    left them at home to take care of things &amp; the union boys press them into
                                    service. It is getting dark and I will say good night to you &amp; in the
                                    morning bright and early while it is cool I will write more unless I am called out
                                    on duty.</p>
                        <p>Saturday morning June <hi rend="i">20th.</hi> I have not been detailed for duty yet.
                                    we have had our breakfast the bill of fare was hard crackers, bacon &amp; tea.
                                    we have got so used to our rough fare that it tastes good to us, but I know what
                                    would be far better a slice of Maggie's good bread &amp; sweet butter
                                    &amp; a cup of her good coffee, then to enjoy her sweet smiles, &amp; listen
                                    to the sound of her voice, to get away from the cold unfeeling world &amp; all
                                    alone to enjoy each others love &amp; confidence—to get away from a
                                    set <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-027-3-074"/> of miserable beings whose life it is to
                                    make others miserable, but they are not worth minding—such people are low
                                    minded &amp; mean—they are quarrelsome &amp; peevish we have some
                                    in our company, some that you know &amp; they know you &amp; know that I
                                    correspond with you, &amp; were impudent enough to write a letter while we were
                                    at camp Morton imitating your hand writing &amp; signing your name to it
                                    &amp; directing it to me. it has not been done but once &amp; I feel
                                    thankful that all they can do or say cannot seperate me from my own sweet
                                    Maggie—who I love more &amp; more every kind letter I get from her O
                                    what joy it gives me to know that she loves me.</p>
                        <p>I expect we will have some important news to write before I send this there has been
                                    a most constant war of cannons at Vicksburg since three hours before day until
                                    within the last hour it has somewhat subsided. O how many poor souls have been
                                    ushered into eternity. there is a rebel force not a great distance from here
                                    &amp; if they attempt to reinforce the rebels at Vicksburg we will be apt to get
                                    into an engagement. I will not mail this until tomorrow evening &amp; perhaps I
                                    will have something interesting to write. When Laf. came in from duty last evening
                                    we went away alone &amp; I read most all of your kind letter to him &amp; it
                                    did him good to hear from home again Lafe says he will write soon &amp; write
                                    about what you requested to know. That sweet little rose came in good order
                                    &amp; I put it between my lips in token of my love to you. I think your cake
                                    will be nice trimmed with those sweet roses. There is a nice little book I would
                                    like you to have it is a small book &amp; will cost about 50 cts in blue
                                    &amp; gold, the title is "The language of flowers" when I get
                                    my money I will have you get it. we need our money very much but I know not when we
                                    will get any. we have a sutler &amp; he sells things at about three prices. the
                                    government authorizes him to issue two dollars each month to a man of his checks
                                    &amp; he draws his pay from the paymaster but it is optional with the men to
                                    draw the checks or not as they like. I suppose our sutler sells a thousand dollars
                                    worth of goods &amp; eatables a month &amp; will probably make his fortune.
                                    last evening at dusk a private of the <hi rend="i">90th</hi> Ill. was shot dead by
                                    one of his fellow soldiers while under the influence of liquor &amp; the same
                                    shot passed through the serjt's hand this murder occured only a short
                                    distance from our tent &amp; we heard the report of the gun. I felt very sorey
                                    to hear such sad news from your cousin it seems hard to think of but such are the
                                    vicissitudes of war. life is very uncertain with us all. I will be heartily glad
                                    when this dredful war is over. I am getting very anxious to hear from my native home
                                    once more I have not heard a word from there since we left Camp Morton. I miss my
                                    mother's good letters very much. I sometimes think it will not be my
                                    privelege to ever see my dear mother again in this world. I have not seen my parents
                                    for over seven years. I hope I hear from them soon. I suppose my mother is about 67
                                    years of age &amp; my father about 74. it makes me sad when I think of them in
                                    their old age all alone not a child to comfort them. Oh how I long to visit home
                                    sweet home. to breathe the pure air &amp; drink the pure cold water &amp;
                                    see those good old hills [Berkshires in Mass,] again but it will not do to build
                                    hopes for this world.</p>

                                    Maggie I will tell you how I spent the day. this morning just at five oclock most
                                    our company (including Laf &amp; me) were called into line with our guns
                                    &amp; equipments for duty they took us out together with others from other
                                    companies making in all 150 men (Monday morning June 22nd) we were supplied with 50
                                    chopping axes &amp; marched out to Uncle Sam's great clearing. there
                                    are thousands of acres of heavy timber in the ravines and hillsides that are being
                                    cut down to make a barrier against the approach of the enemy, instead of a shelter
                                    as it would be if left standing. the 180 men were divided into three reliefs each
                                    relief working one hour at a time, &amp; each man had only two hours work to do
                                    during the day. this was light on us &amp; we could not complain. the fortifying
                                    is progressing very fast the soldiers are taking the spikes out of the big guns that
                                    the rebs left there &amp; they are hauling them to the high points where they
                                    will be used in a better cause than formerly. it has been only a little over one
                                    month since the rebels occupied these bluffs &amp; it is astonishing to see the
                                    amount of work the Yankees have done in so short a time. Well Maggie I have got your
                                    letter most finished &amp; I know not how long it will be before it will reach

                                    untill the fall of Vicksburg. but mails from home will continue so we can hear from
                                    our loved ones. you were a good girl to send me such a kind letter I read them over
                                    many times &amp; think of my gentle confiding Maggie. we can think of each other
                                    now &amp; write often &amp; strengthen the cords of affection that is
                                    entwining itself closer &amp; nearer our hearts until it shall never no never be
                                    severed until death &amp; then to be reunited in a better world where partings
                                    are never known. Mag. I want after awhile when we get our money to get a good
                                    picture [of you] to send home to my mother &amp; I would like to have mine in
                                    the same case but dont know as I can arrange it. I think it is out of the question
                                    to get one taken here. Monday Evening. Mag. I have but a few minutes to finish this
                                    letter we are to leave here tomorrow morning at six they say &amp; we are
                                    drawing three days rations. where we are going it is impossible for me to say but I
                                    think up the river [Yazoo] again but I will close &amp; tell you all about it
                                    when time reveals it to us so good bye dear Maggie for a few days</p>

                        <p>On the morning of the 4th of July the joyful tidings of the surrender of Vicksburg
                                    fell upon our ears &amp; Oh what a thrill of joy it gave us all to hear such
                                    glorious news, to a soldier's ear such news is music, it makes him feel as
                                    if one step was taken towards the accomplishment of his desires &amp; his home
                                    &amp; friends seem a little nearer brought to the time when he is once more to
                                    enjoy their presence &amp; love. the same day at 4 P.M. we were under orders to
                                    proceed on [eastward] to black river &amp; at 5 we were on our way &amp; did
                                    not reach a camping ground until 10 at night, we were all tired &amp; sleep was
                                    a welcome guest to us. early Sunday morning we got our breakfast &amp; drew
                                    rations &amp; traveled until noon when we took refuge from the scorgeng
                                    [scorching sun] in the edge of a big cornfield which bordered on the river &amp;
                                    within halfe a mile of where we supposed Johnston to be fortified on the other side.
                                    we lay hid until dark when we were formed into line of battle &amp; marched
                                    across the field towards the river arriving close to the river we were ordered to
                                    lay down to rest with our guns by our sides, in the night one of our batteries
                                    commenced shelling the woods on opposite side &amp; the next day we lay there
                                    &amp; our skirmishers a short distance in our advance &amp; under shelter of
                                    the trees on the bank of the river kept up a brisk fire at the rebel pickets on the
                                    other side, &amp; they were so near each other we could hear our men curse them
                                    &amp; they would ask our men to go over &amp; get something to drink. well
                                    we did go over that evening about a fourth of a mile below we got a rope across
                                    &amp; crossed on a flat boat. by the time we were across the rebs were making a
                                    hasty retreat back to Jackson the capital &amp; we followed on. we passed the
                                    plantation &amp; mansion of Joe Davis a brother of Jeff's &amp; I
                                    will here mention on our return we found it burnt to ashes. there is the finest
                                    peach orchard on this place I ever saw &amp; I got some as we came back, some
                                    varities were nearly ripe &amp; of an enormous size. On Friday the 10th we came
                                    within 3 miles of Jackson &amp; were formed into a line of battle &amp; were
                                    moved in this way very cautious the skirmishers in advance feeling to find out the
                                    position of the enemy they were fortified close in the edge of town &amp; we met
                                    with no trouble that night but kept advancing until pretty close to their lines,
                                    &amp; about 10 oclock we camped with our guns at our sides. our company
                                    &amp; regt lay across a railroad &amp; next morning we were annoyed by the
                                    bullets of the rebel sharpshooters as they had a good range on us down the railroad.
                                    it got most too warm for us so the Colonel ordered us to take our guns &amp;
                                    move one side under shelter of the timber, while we were in the act of taking arms
                                    one man a member of Campany I received a ball which passed through his head killing
                                    his instantly. soon the rebs commenced throwing shell amongst us as we were under
                                    cover of the timber they passed harmless by yet some burst very close &amp; some
                                    of our men came close to getting hit. we soon changed our position &amp; were
                                    put in line of battle before the rebel works &amp; under cover of the oak grubs
                                    here we lay for three days exposed to the shot &amp; shell of the enemy
                                    &amp; living almost entirely on dry crackers as we dare not build a fire for it
                                    would show the rebs our position &amp; expose us to their shells. while we lay
                                    there they kept up an almost <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-027-3-077"/> constant fire
                                    &amp; several shells burst almost in our midst. on Wednesday we were moved to
                                    the rear a mile to forage &amp; recruit up the boys soon brought in a good
                                    supply of beef mutton &amp; pork, &amp; we got plenty of coffee, &amp;
                                    soon we began to get recruited. on Wednesday night the <hi rend="i">15th</hi> [July]
                                    the rebs probably finding the force against them was too great evacuated the place
                                    &amp; fled by railroad on the opposite side just in time to avoid being
                                    surrounded we were then ordered down the railroad to tear up the track, &amp;
                                    burn the ties &amp; bend the iron so as to make a good job of it we spent the
                                    remainder of the week at this work &amp; destroyed about ten miles of the road
                                    &amp; Sunday morning the <hi rend="i">19th</hi> were ordered back to camp where
                                    we remained next day. on Wednesday the Division with colors flying marched through
                                    the town &amp; the soldiers had one hour to stop &amp; bathe in the Pearl
                                    river this was intended for a pleasure excursion yet it did not seem much like it to
                                    us, as the sun was extremely hot &amp; it was very dusty. we were glad to get
                                    back to camp. the town is not near as large as <placeName>

                                    most desolating appearance. Thursday morning before daylight we left our camp before
                                    Jackson &amp; retraced our march to this place where we arrived last Saturday it
                                    is only about one quarter mile from black river where we are camped in the timber.
                                    it is a lovely place &amp; we get tolerable good water. our teams got back from
                                    the bluffs today with our knapsacks &amp; we were glad to get our blankets again
                                    &amp; I was glad to see my old portfolio again with my writing paper &amp;
                                    ink. Tuesday July 28th for want of time I did not finish this letter yesterday
                                    &amp; now I will tell you that the prospect is that we will stop here for
                                    several weeks, &amp; I feel glad for I can get the rest I need &amp; I can
                                    write to my true love &amp; read her kind letters….</p>

                    which was christened Camp Sherman. While here, Private Cook received a letter from his brother
                    Edward, whom he had long believed to be dead. This brother, now thirty-six years of age and two
                    years the senior of Charles N., who had gone to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> during the gold rush, joined the Army of the Potomac early in the War. When released

                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>. He had not been in touch with them for over a year and a half, and, like Charles, they
                    believed that he had lost his life soon after going to the front.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his letters to Margaret Ball, Private Cook continued to pour out his love, but he also described
                    quite minutely the life of the camp. He was very religious and older than most of his comrades in
                    the ranks. He was never able to accustom himself to the profanity and vulgar speech so often
                    indulged in by <list type="footnotes">

                    wander off by himself to re-read Margaret's letters, to write replies, to enjoy what nature
                    had to offer, or to commune with himself. It would seem that many of his companions in arms
                    developed a dislike for him. In a letter of August 6, 1863, he wrote: <text>

            <p>While in the South, Private Cook contracted chronic diarrhoea and rheumatism, ailments that were to
                    trouble him to the end of his life. While in the service, he frequently recovered from these
                    afflictions, for shorter or longer periods, so that in spite of them he was able to complete the
                    three years for which he had volunteered. Many times, he wrote "Maggie" that he
                    was anxious to obtain a furlough, that he might visit <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and possibly go to the Berkshires to see his father and mother. He was consumed with a
                    desire to visit "Maggie", whom, it will be recalled he had never seen. When he
                    finally obtained a furlough near the beginning of September, 1863, he was obliged to inform his
                    "sweetheart" that he felt it best not to make the long journey: "I
                    don't know Maggie but you will blame me if I tell you I had the chance to go north
                    &amp; did not improve it. You will remember it is a long trip from here to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> &amp; I have been sick for several weeks &amp; consequently am weak so I think
                    it better to remain here until I get another chance when I am in good health and in a condition to
                    enjoy the visit." The furlough was transferred to a comrade, and Private Cook did not reach <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> until two more years had passed.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Though thirty-four years of age,

            <p>In a letter of September 16, 1863, an attempt was made to explain fully the discipline and duties of
                    soldiers in camp. In another of the next day, also written at Camp Sherman near Vicksburg, the

                                    we don't care if he never comes back. there is a little too much poppy show
                                    about him for my use. We all like our Col. Fowler he is a whole souled man &amp;
                                    works for the well being of the men, but he is now acting as commander of the
                                    brigade so we have for the present lost him. he took a trip north a few weeks since.
                                    it was after dark when he arrived at the camp the report of his arrival soon spread
                                    out among the regt &amp; the boys flocked together at his tent like children
                                    welcoming a returned parent, the drums were brought out &amp; beat three times
                                    three cheers rent the air &amp; the old Col. had to come out so he told the boys
                                    he was as glad to see them as they were him &amp; requested them to go back to
                                    their quarters and <hi rend="i">make less noise.</hi> the next day the Col. had many
                                    a good shake of hands, that is the kind of an officer we want, not the little
                                    upstarts who make the men stand out on guard &amp; keep a man pacing before his
                                    quarters &amp; set the men to grubbing up big stumps &amp; usurping his
                                    authority to the discomfitllre of the men. give me an old patriot to serve under one
                                    that knows what active service is &amp; feels for his, men….</p>

            <p>For a number of weeks while on this march, Private Cook gained strength and seems really to have

                    getting excellent &amp; I have recovered from my lameness." This statement is somewhat
                    surprising as he had passed through a harrowing experience for a man with rheumatism, only a few
                    weeks before. In his own words the story runs: <text>

                                    by that time the regt was gone. Yet I was not able to walk even a common gait but

                    the end of September. If any were written, they are not preserved. The probability is that none were
                    mailed by Private Cook in that period. His letters to his parents generally included much about
                    "Maggie", but in one of April 8, 1864, he merely said: "I have given up
                    the idea of comiting the crime of Matrimony at present." On September 29, 1864, after
                    having heard from Margaret again, he opened his reply with these sentences: <text>

            <p>The cloud which arose to darken the hitherto bright path of love for these young people appeared in
                    February, 1864. Some acquaintance of Miss Ball, who was in camp with her lover, sent her an account
                    of him which gave her pause. She, however, wrote him the substance of the evil report that she had
                    heard which was that he was a man without moral character and an object of disgust covered with dirt
                    and vermin.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> His reply indicates an adequate amount of righteous indignation,
                    but is manly and sincere. He declared that he would not write to defend his character, that he had
                    no fears in regard to it, believing that by the help of God it would stand, since his life was, he
                    trusted, based on "principles firm as rock." In regard to the "dirt and
                    vermine", the much distressed and disturbed lover bravely told the truth and gave what
                    should have been an entirely satisfactory explanation.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The next letter from
                    "Maggie" was comforting to Private Cook, and the correspondence went on for a
                    short time much as before. It was not long, however, until the letters ceased to pass between them
                    for several months. The cause seems to have been that enemies of Private Cook continued to send evil
                    reports to Miss Ball, which led her to believe that her soldier lover had betrayed her confidence by
                    allowing others to see her letters to him. After the reconciliation, Cook made a statement relative
                    to this charge which he considered very serious: <text>

                                    was brought from the camp near Wilmington to that place last Thursday &amp;
                                    stoped in the Hospital there until the next day when we took the boat &amp; came
                                    down Fear river to this place which is situated at the mouth of Fear river &amp;
                                    near the ocean so we get a good bracing sea-breeze which is quite reviving, this
                                    seems to be a general Hospital, there are several hundred patience [patients] here.
                                    We are in large Hospital tents, have good matrass 1 wollen blanket &amp; good
                                    pillow &amp; linen sheets, with iron bedsteads, for "grub" we
                                    get pretty good tea 3 times a day with milk &amp; sugar, a slice of good bread
                                    &amp; butter &amp; sanitary stores such as Tomatoes blackberries &amp;c
                                    this is for light diet &amp; I am on that our food is scant but good but I must
                                    tell you how I came to get in to a hospital, for some time I have felt the rhumatism
                                    coming on &amp; of course it first took me in my lame side &amp; soon I got
                                    so that I was hardly able to walk about &amp; take care of myself so the Docktor
                                    sent me off to the Hosp. I will state since the rhumatism took hold of me my diahrea
                                    entirely left me &amp; I have a good apetite &amp; hope soon to be well, it
                                    is probable we will all be shiped north in a few days &amp; be discharged I am
                                    told that it is the order for all men in Hosp who are not under a phisicians care
                                    are to be discharged immediately. I hope to get home some time in June or July, so

                                    for dead or perhaps think I may have forgotten a certain light haired &amp; blue

                        <p>I think the last letter I sent you was written while in the convalesant camp near

                                    of my plans for the future. I will state that the latter part of April &amp;
                                    early in May I was taken down with the rhumatism which proceeded from the injury in
                                    my side which you will recollect I got a fall on the boat last winter. about the <hi rend="i">10th</hi> of May several of [us were] crowded into government wagons
                                    &amp; hauled to the city of Wilmington a distance of about 3 miles, &amp; it
                                    was the toughest ride I ever took. To my great joy we at length turned up to a good
                                    hospital in the city, a fine three story building here we got a good supper bed

                                    to say to each other I do believe our children are forgeting us in our old age. far
                                    as I am concerned you can rest assured that such is not the case, for I often think
                                    of you &amp; the scenes that used to surround my birthplace &amp; the many
                                    familiar faces, most of which are no more seen on earth. &amp; as often do I
                                    feel a longing to set my eyes on those grand old mountains &amp; have a ramble
                                    over them. but circumstances at present are rather unfavorable to realize anything
                                    of the kind my health all this winter has been very poor. for near all the time I
                                    have not been able to do even light work &amp; Margaret has done my feeding and
                                    built the fires most of the time and her brothers have cut my stove wood so you see
                                    we have had it rather rough. my trouble has been the old complaint with chills
                                    &amp; fever I have been having what is called third day ague, &amp; the most
                                    obstinate to get broke of all. &amp; I was reduced down &amp; very weak from
                                    the effects of diarahrea which made it still worse. I have applied for an increase
                                    in Pension with a fair prospect of geting it, was at Logan yestarday &amp; got
                                    examined. had another chill after geting home. although I have had it so rough the
                                    past few months my wife &amp; children have got along with less sickness than
                                    common &amp; Margaret has braved it through nobly. our two little [ones] are in
                                    good health. Willie is the picture of health he has been going to school has one
                                    more week his progress is good &amp; he is fond of reading but does not like to
                                    work except when he anticipates some pay after it is done, then he will work like a
                                    good fellow. Anabel is peiceing a quilt &amp; if she lives I think will be like
                                    her mother, a good seamstress. We have three cows to come in soon &amp; about 70
                                    hens &amp; pullets. so I will get a custard now &amp; then. no letter from
                                    Ed. do you hear from him. if possible let us hear from you soon write all about how

            <p>In 1830, Thomas Lincoln and family migrated from the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, neighborhood, where they had lived for fourteen years. The route which was
                    used has become a matter of controversy. A "Lincoln Highway Commission" appointed
                    by Governor Ralston in 1915 reported officially in 1916 that the route of 1830 led from the Lincoln
                    home near Gentry-ville through Dale, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Jasper</region>, <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>

                    </placeName> "by the most direct route". Governor Ralston submitted the findings
                    of his Commission to the Legislature (1917), but the report was not accepted. A new move to discover
                    the correct route was made by Governor Leslie in the appointment of the "Indiana Lincoln
                    Memorial Highway Commission". The members of this Commission have the problem before them
                    at present.</p>

                    William L. Barker, Philip Lutz, Jr., and Union W. Youngblood. The argument, supported by various
                    affidavits and other evidence, is to the effect that the Lincolns could not have gone northward
                    through Dale and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>

            <p>Frederick Jackson Turner, as he was when a young professor at the University of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the early nineties, is presented in a charming manner by Dr. Joseph Schafer,

                        </placeName> History Magazine.</hi> It was in 1893, that Turner read his famous essay,
                    "The Significance of the Frontier in American History," before the American
                    Historical Association. Schafer enrolled in Professor Turner's class in 1892. As a
                    matriculating freshman, he expected to take two years in the College of Liberal Arts and then enter
                    the Law School. Contact with Turner changed the life purpose of the student. He "promptly
                    forgot that such a study as the law existed", and "became wedded to
                    history". A student under the writer of "The Significance of the
                    Frontier" when that essay was in preparation, Dr. Schafer is able to
                    "present", <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-027-3-089"/> as he says, "a kind of

                    inception." All who know Dr. Turner or who have an interest in his interpretation of

            <head>Comment</head>
            <p>A panic would not be so bad were it not for the after effects. The crash on the stock market, the
                    immediate business failures, the stoppage of speculation, the sharp curtailment of credit, the slump
                    in ordering by retailers—all these phenomena that produce the first shocks of a panic are
                    exciting and stir the trading classes deeply, but they only mark the beginning of a long depression
                    in most instances. The motive power of business becomes gradually and persistently weaker. The
                    giants of the business world get caught in the whirlpool with smaller men and all seem helpless.
                    Those take care of themselves who can, while the rest suffer more or less heavily or completely
                    succumb.</p>
            <p>Americans, in times of prosperity, worship "hard-headed" business men and it is
                    extremely difficult for anyone else to get a hearing. A college professor is not deemed wise enough
                    in matters pertaining to economic affairs to come in out of a thunder shower unless warned by some
                    banker, manufacturer or merchant. In a time of stress and strain when bold men of affairs are
                    silent, the situation is different. With these prefatory remarks, let it be stated that history
                    seems to teach: that bankers lend far too much in periods of prosperity on valuations that are far
                    too high, a consequence being the lending of far too little in times of depression from necessity or
                    fear; that manufacturers expand much too extensively and too readily when business is good, thus
                    multiplying the number of idle plants and idle men in times of adversity; that merchants unduly
                    enlarge their establishments and unduly stimulate sales when customers are in a buying mood, only to
                    face uncalled for disaster with the coming of a great and prolonged lessening in the purchasing
                    power of consumers. The responsibility for the beginning crash may partly rest on speculators, but
                    the inability of the business world to stand the shock and the blame for the long depression that
                    usually follows a panic rests squarely on regular and supposedly sane business men who exercise
                    little restraint when production, buying and selling are on the up-grade. One sure way to aid in the
                    destruction of a reasonable and legitimate prosperity is for men absorbed <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-027-3-092"/> in industry and trade to allow themselves to be swept along by an
                    excessive and still growing current of expansion.</p>
            <p>The perfection of machines capable of producing an ever vaster quantity of goods, advertising on a
                    colossal scale, the development of high-powered salesmanship, the almost unlimited expansion of
                    credit—these factors cause trade and production to outrun the buying power of the public.
                    The theory that consumers persuaded to extend greatly their purchases can be led to expand
                    indefinitely is false. The soothing conception that instalment buying tends to stabilize business is
                    untrue. The "buy now" slogan used in a wide-spread effort to revive business after
                    the present depression had settled down on the country was of little avail for an obvious
                    reason—multitudes had bought <hi rend="i">then</hi> and could neither <hi rend="i">buy
                        now</hi> nor pay for what had been purchased <hi rend="i">then.</hi> Recurring business crises
                    teach emphatically the lesson that to eliminate them or minimize their effects periods of excessive
                    prosperity or "boom times" must be prevented.</p>
            <p>Men and women who remember the panic of 1893 and the prolonged depression that followed must be
                    impressed by striking contrasts, as well as similarities, between those dismal years and current
                    times. The "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> panic" truly had a setting different from that of the "Hoover
                    panic." The former arrived at the beginning of a Democratic and expected-to-be anti-tariff
                    administration, while the latter broke on the country in the midst of a Republican and less or more
                    pro-tariff administration. Gold was scarce in 1893, but plentiful in 1929. Hosts of laborers could
                    be influenced to vote by the promise of a "full dinner-pail" in 1896, but, while
                    dining is still a very necessary habit, the battle cry that was deemed so appropriate in the
                    presidential canvass of a generation ago will carry no party to victory in 1932.</p>
            <p>In those last years of the nineteenth century, there were no movies, no stadiums, no world series, no
                    radios, no filling stations, no <hi rend="i">automobiles</hi> (except the horseless buggy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elwood</settlement>
                    </placeName> Haynes, which the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> saw in operation on the streets of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the spring of 1898, and a few others that appeared before the dawn of the new
                    century). Livery stables were everywhere and bicycles infested the land. Great was the fear of the
                    "scorcher", who was regarded as a dangerous menace to <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-027-3-093"/> pedestrians. Manufacturers and merchants declared that business was
                    stagnant and, to one who visited factories and shopping centers, the evidence was fully apparent.
                    Industry and trade were dead indeed. All activities were reduced to the lowest terms. People who had
                    nothing to do and no reason for going anywhere usually stayed at home. Roads and streets were quiet.
                    Amusements and sports attracted limited numbers.</p>
            <p>Today streets and highways are congested with cars, buses and trucks. Everyone is doing something or
                    going somewhere, with or without reason. Colossal numbers attend the games between the Cardinals and
                    the Athletics in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, while gigantic stadiums are filled to capacity to witness football contests. People
                    buy cars, clothing, food, everything in fact, in vast quantities. Even so, they do not buy enough.
                    Unemployment exists on a scale never before equaled. Business failures occur with great frequency.
                    Unprecedented sums are being raised to care for the needy in every city. There are hosts that are
                    hungry and without fuel, while foodstuffs and coal are abundant and cheap on the farms and at the
                    mines. Man can not lift himself by his bootstraps. He can not ignore or violate the laws of
                    economics. But, within the circle to which he is limited, he can examine and greatly improve the
                    intricate systems of finance and distribution of income which serve the people so inadequately.
                    Whosoever does not recognize the responsibility to do just this is a menace to society.</p>
            <p>It is not possible to define exactly the term <hi rend="i">pioneer.</hi> Of Gecessity the word must
                    have considerable latitude in its application. Whose names have a right to be enrolled among the
                    pioneers of Indiana or among those of any county of the state? To apply the term to those who were
                    residents of any given area when organized as a county and to none who settled in such a county
                    afterwards is to restrict the application of the term too narrowly and even to lose sight of its
                    real meaning. For a state-wide society to settle on a single date for the whole of Indiana and deny
                    membership to all who are descended from persons who migrated to the state after that year, seems
                    likewise to miss the meaning of the term. In addition, to determine <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-027-3-094"/> the question in such a manner gives an undue advantage to a number of
                    counties while discriminating against many others.</p>
            <p>In general, pioneers would seem to include all who came to settle on lands never before occupied by
                    civilized men or to make new homes for themselves in villages or towns established in areas still in
                    process of colonization. As everyone knows, a belt near the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> plus
                    narrow strips bordering the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> on the East and lying along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> on the West were first colonized. As the years went by settlers occupied the New
                    Purchase and later central and northeastern Indiana. The prairie counties of the northwestern part
                    of the state were the last to be occupied. Men and women were pioneering in parts of northern
                    Indiana as late as 1850 and 1860, as truly as other settlers had done in the oldest parts of the
                    state in the territorial period.</p>
            <p>It seems that no local society of pioneers nor the Society of Indiana Pioneers should withhold
                    membership from any person whose family located at any time before the Civil War on land which never
                    before such occupation had been reduced to private ownership. For those who came to Indiana, when it
                    was a frontier territory or state, to build a home or start a business in any village or town during
                    its first ten years of existence, the term <hi rend="i">pioneer</hi> should certainly be applied.
                    Whether such a town or village was founded near the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> in 1810 or near
                        <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> in 1850, surely the necessity for pioneering was much the
                    same.</p>
