                                            madness, and ascribe it to religious doubts which seized
                                            on his mind at a time of great irritation and annoyance
                                            from various causes; but it is certain that Tasso
                                            himself connected his cruel detention with his love for
                                            the princess; that he addressed both her and her sister
                                            in an ode couched in the most moving and melancholy
                                            terms, and appealing to her pity; and that, in a letter
                                            to Scipio Gonzaga, describing his misery while in
                                            confinement, he expresses a bitter confidence that,
                                            could the princess behold with her own eyes the
                                            wretchedness to which he was reduced, she would âhave
                                            compassion on him.â</p></note>

                        <note anchored="true">[Among other relics preserved in the Cathedral at
                            Aix-la-Chapelle is the ivory hunting-horn of Charlemagne. It is massive
                            and heavy, and the attempt of the guide to sound it (for the amusement
                            of tourists and strangers) is singularly unsuccessful, the note produced
                            being the most faint and lugubrious which it is possible to
                            conceive.]</note>

                                    repeated, with most passionate lamentations, âO, friend!
                                    faithful friend!â Respecting his grief, I passed on, marvelling
