				<p>The object of this book is to place in the hands of workingmen, and those who are in
					sympathy with their ideals, information that is indispensable for a proper understanding
					of the problems of today. So far as the writer knows there is no other work published that
					attempts to trace the historic processes by which the millionaire rulers of America have
					succeeded to power and wealth greater than any class in history ever possessed. One
						writer<ref id="ref_001" target="note_001" rend="super">1</ref> has attempted such an
					outline, but as his book is a small one and covers a field much larger than my own, the
					result is a fleeting view that leaves much unexplained. However, as he has in mind a much
					larger work and as he has devoted years to gathering material for it, I am sure that, with
					his equipment, it will prove an indispensable work to those who would understand our
					past.</p>
				<p>In this work I have only considered the period from settlement times down to the
					nineteenth century. This has enabled me to use a great deal of material that could not be
					used at all in a book of this size had I attempted to include the period following the
					adoption of the Constitution of the United States. Even as presented the writer is
					conscious that his treatment of our past history is necessarily fleeting, but to have made
					it a larger work would have been to publish it at a price that would have restricted its
					sale among workingmen, and I am more anxious to get the information into their hands than
					to publish it at a price more remunerative to me.</p>
				<p>Some of the statements made in the following pages will come as a shock to those who have
					absorbed the current views of American history, and yet no important assertion is made
					without reference to standard authorities. The references will serve as a guide to those
					who would like to consult the original sources or pursue their investigations <note

						America," Chas H. Kerr &amp; Company, Chicago.</note>
					<pb id="VAC1311-006" n="vi"/> further. Most of the works quoted may be found in any fairly
					well-equipped public library.</p>
				<p>We may briefly summarize the important factors or events that led to the control of
					government and wealth productive resources by a small class, and their relation to the
					workers, past and present, as follows:</p>
				<list type="ordered" rend="decimal">
					<item>The discovery of America followed by the landing of a horde of adventurers drawn by
						the lure of gold.</item>
					<item>The confiscation of immense tracts of land by foreign princes who gave them to
						favorites, including in the grants extensive powers of rulership over these
						domains.</item>
					<item>Luring beggared workers of Europe to the New World with deceptive promises and
						selling them into temporary slavery on their arrival. Kidnaping whites in Europe and
						raiding Africa for blacks and selling both in America.</item>
					<item>Enactment by the land aristocracy of penal codes and fugitive slave laws applying to
						black and white slaves.</item>
					<item>Withholding political privileges from all those not belonging to the property-owning
						classes.</item>
					<item>Breaking of ties binding the American aristocracy to their brethren of the Old World
						through the American Revolution.</item>
					<item>The Constitutional Convention, a secret conspiratory body and counter-revolution
						against poor debtors, representing a usurping minority of aristocrats, who secured by
						force, fraud and deception a strong government giving them more efficient legislative,
						police and military power over the workers.</item>
					<item>This ruling class later dividing into the owners of blacks in the South and sweaters
						of whites in the North, resulting in a struggle that ended by extending the sway of the
						Northern exploiters to the gulf and to both seas.</item>
					<item>The rise of the labor movement in the first quarter of the nineteenth century
						gradually extending its organization until today the most advanced of this army
						challenge the masters of America for control of its wealth-producing and governing
						powers.</item>

					<pb id="VAC1311-007" n="vii"/>
					<item>The future triumph of the workers by conquering the governing and wealth-producing
						powers and managing them for the common good of all.</item>
				</list>
				<p>The last three stages mentioned are scarcely considered at all in this work, as they are
					more familiar to the people today and to review them would make this book a larger one
					than the author planned. Besides, there are many works accessible to workingmen where
					these stages are discussed at length.</p>
				<p>The writer may here anticipate some criticisms that may be made regarding what is said of
					Penn, Washington, Hamilton, Madison and other "heroic" figures in American history. Those
					who profit by the miserable mismanagement of society today use the "great men" of the past
					as a valuable asset in appeals for support of their rule. The distorted "history" which
					our school books present has also given us some historical traditions that have no basis
					in fact. To topple both over and present these men and these traditions in their true
					perspective is a service in behalf of the sweated millions of today. In this connection we
					may here quote what Wendell Phillips said of Webster, in 1853, as it applies to this hero
					worship which is so much cultivated by the masters who rule:</p>
				<p>"We seek only to be honest men, and speak the same of the dead as of the living. If the
					graves that hide their bodies could swallow also the evil they have done and the example
					they leave, we might enjoy at least the luxury of forgetting them. But the evil that men
					do lives after them, and example acquires tenfold authority when it speaks from the grave.
					How shall we make way against the overwhelming weight of some colossal reputation, if we
					do not turn from the idolatrous present, and appeal to the human race? saying to your
					idols of today, 'Here we are defeated; but we will write our judgment with the iron pen of
					a century to come, and it shall never be forgotten that you were false in your generation
					to the claims of the slave' . . . . We warn the living that we have terrible memories, and
					that their sins are never to be forgotten. <pb id="VAC1311-008" n="viii"/> We will gibbet
					the name of every apostate so black and high that his children's children shall blush to
					bear it."<ref id="ref_002" target="note_002" rend="super">2</ref></p>
				<p>Of course, we do not hold individuals responsible for social or economic evils, but when
					"great men" profit by oppressive institutions or by their acts add to the abuses and
					grievances of the workers, we protest against placing them on pedestals to be worshiped as
					many of them are. They are products of their age and environment and naturally followed
					courses dictated by their material gains. Their incomes were derived from holding labor in
					subjection, whether white or black, and establishing laws that enabled them to enforce
					their class domination against the protests of the laborers.</p>
				<p>I have allowed competent authorities to speak as often as possible in the following
					pages. To do this I have found it difficult to avoid making the book a larger one than I
					send out. Much interesting material has been sacrificed in this effort, but enough is
					presented to indicate some of the main outlines and important institutions that form the
					background of civilization in America.</p>
				<p>The writer makes no pretense at literary style and any criticism from this point of view
					will be lost on him. His observation has been that most bourgeois writers today pen
					beautiful inanities in flowing English that charm and soothe jaded idlers or suspend the
					thinking faculties of workingmen. Empty platitudes and "blessed words" are their stock in
					trade. The writer has no wish to indulge in them. He has tried to deal with some forgotten
					or suppressed facts of American history, and if what he has written arms thinking
					workingmen with some knowledge that will render them immune to the arts of vulgar
					politicians, he will feel repaid for the labor of writing this small volume.</p>

					<head rend="center b">The European Background</head>
					<p>To understand the history of America it is necessary to review briefly the main events
						in Europe which had a marked influence in shaping our destiny here. Masses of men do not
						emigrate to another continent merely for the love of adventure, especially when such
						emigration implies a hazardous sea voyage and the hardships of a wilderness inhabited by
						savage tribes. Influences more effective and less romantic brought hordes of workingmen
						to people the New World; influences that make one of the blackest pages in history, for
						they include the crucifixion and spoliation of a wealth-producing class. They led not
						only to the forcible exportation of pauperized workers, but inaugurated a slave traffic
						in white laborers that included kidnaping of men, women and children in European ports
						and selling them into temporary slavery in every American colony.</p>
					<p>We may trace the beginning of this process with the year 1348, when the Black Death
						swept over Europe. It is estimated that fully one-third of the population perished of
						the plague. With the scarcity of laborers wages naturally began to rise. They rose
						thirty and even fifty per cent. Parliament, under the control of the ruling class,
						attempted to interfere with the "law of supply and demand." The famous Statute of
						Laborers provided that wages should be the same as two years before the plague, but the
						laborers succeeded in evading the law. The scarcity of laborers made higher wages
						inevitable and the employer connived with the laborer to violate the statutes as he
						considered himself fortunate to have any laborers at all. Conditions for the workers
						became so improved that this period came to be known, in England, as the Golden Age of
						Labor, an age when the highest well-being known to the poor was enjoyed. The old
						chroniclers frequently refer to it as "Merrie England." From the point of view <pb
							id="VAC1311-010" n="10"/> of the hours worked and the purchasing power of the wages
						received, the income of these workers was the highest ever realized. Professor Rogers
						asserts that "The artisan who is demanding at this time an eight-hour day in the
						building trades is simply striving to recover what his ancestors worked by four or five
						centuries ago." The highest point reached was in the closing years of the fifteenth
						century. The sixteenth century brought with it the Reformation and the beginning of a
						series of acts that robbed the laborers of their advantages and forcibly transformed
						them into beggars and outcasts.<ref id="ref_003" target="note_003" rend="super"
						>1</ref></p>
					<p>The Catholic church was proprietor of a great part of the land of Great Britain. In
						fact, "The Church had become the largest land owner in all Western Christendom, nearly
						one-third of all the land in Germany, France and England belonging to her."<ref
							id="ref_004" target="note_004" rend="super">2</ref> The suppression of the
						monasteries, which had been a refuge for the laborers in times of distress, threw masses
						of them on the market, helpless and dependent. The Reformation brought with it pillage
						and spoliation of church property. The estates of the church were given away to
						favorites of the court or sold to speculators who drove away the tenants. Seizure after
						seizure of lands was made. It was the beginning of an era of conquest which was to have
						the New World as its greatest prize. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
						parliament continued the process of pauperizing the masses by enclosing the common lands
						which had been at the disposal of the poor. These acts simply legalized the thefts, the
						ruling classes merely voting to themselves what they wanted.</p>
					<p>There was the further process known as "the clearing of estates" which extended into
						the nineteenth century. Marx gives one classic example where the Dutchess of Sutherland,
						in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, with the aid of British soldiers, rooted
						out 15,000 people and took possession of nearly 800,000 acres of land <note
							id="note_003"><ref target="ref_003" rend="super">1</ref> See Rogers, "Six Centuries of
							Work and Wages."</note>
						<note id="note_004"><ref target="ref_004" rend="super">2</ref> Kautsky, "Communism in
							Central Europe in the Time of the Reformation," p. 30.</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-011" n="11"/> and transformed them into a sheepwalk. The good lady later
						entertained Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," by way of showing her
						sympathy with the abolition movement in America!</p>
					<p>This driving of the workers off the land to wander as vagabonds on the highways had its
						counterpart in other countries. In 1452 "A similar though less influential part was
						played in many districts of Bohemia by the fishponds constructed by the landlords. If,
						as Thomas More said, the sheep ate up the peasants of England, those of Bohemia were
						equally devoured by carp."<ref id="ref_005" target="note_005" rend="super">3</ref></p>
					<p>The ruling class, having reduced the workers to beggars and outcasts, began the bloody
						legislation on which rests many of the fortunes of British "gentlemen" today. A few
						examples from English history will suffice. A statute of Henry VIII in 1530 provided
						that beggars old and unable to work should receive a license. Whipping and imprisonment
						were provided for the able-bodied. They were to be "tied to the cart-tail and whipped
						till the blood streams down their bodies then to swear on oath to go back to their birth
						place" and work. The oath they could not keep as the lands were confiscated and
						manufacture, then in its infancy, could not employ them. "For the second arrest for
						vagabondage the whipping is to be repeated and half the ear sliced off; but for the
						third relapse the offender is to be executed as a hardened criminal and an enemy of the
						common weal." The baptism of blood and fire continues for a statute of Edward VI,
						nineteen years later (1549), gives power to the masters to enslave any worker whom they
						denounce as an idler. The master may force him to any work with whip or chains. If the
						worker absents himself for a fortnight he is to be branded on the forehead with a letter
						S and be a slave for life. The master can sell him or bequeath him to others. If the
						slave revolts he is to be executed. Anyone can take away the children of vagabonds and
						keep them as apprentices. Similar laws were enacted in France, Holland, and the
						Netherlands. Organizations of laborers to improve their<note id="note_005"><ref
								target="ref_005" rend="super">3</ref> Ibid, p. 77.</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-012" n="12"/> conditions were, in England, outlawed from the fourteenth
						century to 1825. The break-up of Feudalism and the Reformation, coming in the name of
						"freedom of conscience," released all the vilest passions of the dormant commercial
						classes who started their career of conquest and plunder with the methods briefly
						outlined above. They brought a scourge to the back of the laborer. The generation that
						came after the Golden Age was a landless, pauperized, vagabond host of beggars, crowding
						the highways of England, branded with irons for their poverty by the class that had
						reduced them to want, and "Merrie England" became only a memory.</p>
					<p>Luther incarnated the interests of this pitiless ruling class. "He resisted every
						attempt of the lower classes to derive material benefit from the Reformation, by
						favoring each step taken by the Princes in this direction. <hi rend="i">They</hi> were
						to become the owners of the Church property, not the peasants. 'It is not our business
						to attack the monasteries,' he writes (1524), 'but to, draw hearts away from them. When,
						then, churches and monasteries are lying deserted, let the reigning princes do with them
						what they please.'"<ref id="ref_006" target="note_006" rend="super">4</ref></p>
					<p>It is not our purpose to attack Protestantism or its opponent, but merely to show that
						the "liberty" the former brought into the world was not for the workers. Their liberty,
						like their "salvation," was relegated to the "other world." Luther's crusade was the
						championship of a new ruling class that wished to throw off the old feudal restrictions.
						It stood for a new ruling class and its opponent defended an old one. "The religious
						reformation of the sixteenth century was not the cause, but the effect, of the social
						reformation that followed upon the shifting of the economic center from the manor to the
						city. And that was preceded by the rise of navigation and the discovery of the New World
						and new trade routes, which indicate the rise of manufacture."<ref id="ref_007"
							target="note_007" rend="super">5</ref></p>
					<p>In France the reduction of the workers to beggary is <note id="note_006"><ref

						<note id="note_007"><ref target="ref_007" rend="super">5</ref> Dietzgen, "Philosophical
							Essays," p. 87.</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-013" n="13"/> a grim record of horrors. The frightful poverty of the
						peasants and laborers reached a depth perhaps unknown to any other country. Taine quotes
						La Bruyere who wrote in 1689: "Certain savage-looking beings, male and female, are seen
						in the country, black, livid, and sunburnt, and belonging to the soil which they dig and
						grub with invincible stubbornness. They seem capable of articulation, and, when they
						stand erect, they display human lineaments. They are, in fact, men. They retire at night
						into their dens where they live on black bread, water and roots. They . . . should not
						be in want of the bread they have planted." Taine adds: "They continue in want of it
						during twenty-five years after this and die in herds. I estimate that <hi rend="i">in
							1715 more than one-third of the population, six millions, perished with hunger and of
							destitution."</hi><ref id="ref_008" target="note_008" rend="super">6</ref></p>
					<p>By 1727 many live on the grass in the fields, which provokes St. Simon to declare that
						"The first king in Europe is great simply by being a king of beggars of all conditions."
						Another writer in 1739 mentions three famine insurrections. The Bishop of Chartres told
						the king that "the famine and the mortality were such that men ate grass like sheep and
						died like so many flies." Two years later one town of four thousand people has eighteen
						hundred poor. "The clothes of the poor are seized and the last measure of flour, the
						latches on their doors," etc.<ref id="ref_009" target="note_009" rend="super"
						>7</ref></p>
					<p>In Germany the thirty years' war, 1618-48, wrought terrible havoc, the peasants and
						laborers being reduced to conditions of suffering that words cannot exaggerate. Whole
						provinces were laid waste and transformed into deserts. "Friend could not be
						distinguished from foe, and men would wrest from their starving neighbors a crust of
						bread. It has been recorded that not even human flesh was sacred, that the gallows, and
						church-yards were <hi rend="i">put under guard to protect them against theft by
							desperate, famine-stricken people.</hi> Incredible as it may seem, in some instances
						even murder and cannibalism were resorted to. The neighborhood of the city of Worms . .

						<pb id="VAC1311-014" n="14"/> afforded cover for a group of beggars, who fell upon
						passers-by and devoured their bodies for sustenance."<ref id="ref_010" target="note_010"
							rend="super">8</ref></p>
					<p>The wars waged by Louis XIV on the Rhenish Palatinate, in 1674 and 1688, devastated
						that beautiful country to such an extent that it required two generations to restore it
						to its normal condition. Cities and villages were burnt, thousands were beggared, and
						lands were confiscated by the French king. Famine and pestilence were added to the other
						miseries of the unfortunate inhabitants. The invasions seemed to follow a settled
						policy. The people would no sooner recover from one than another would follow, with the
						customary pillage of crops and thefts of property. One French army gave seeds to the
						farmers for another harvest after having robbed the district.<ref id="ref_011"
							target="note_011" rend="super">9</ref> The peasants, filled with despair, ceased to
						till the soil which only increased the general wretchedness. They were saddled with
						heavy taxes "levied to support an extravagant court that hunted, feasted and reveled
						until bankruptcy or revolution put an end to their riotous living."<ref id="ref_012"
							target="note_012" rend="super">10</ref></p>
					<p>All this made the victims an easy prey to the emigration agents of William Penn who
						were in Germany engaged in an enthusiastic crusade in behalf of emigration to
						Pennsylvania. Penn had also won the admiration of Queen Anne, who was interested in his
						colonization plans so that "systematic effort was made to induce them (the Germans) to
						come to England in order to be shipped to America. Thus in the years 1708 and 1709 more
						than thirty thousand Germans crossed the Channel, and were soon afterward brought in
						English ships to New York and the Carolinas, but, above all, to Pennsylvania."<ref
							id="ref_013" target="note_013" rend="super">11</ref></p>
					<p>It will be seen from this brief survey that all Europe was undergoing changes that

					<p>A glamour of romance has grown up about the persons and deeds of navigators like
						Columbus, so that today they seem to tower above the rest of humanity in courage,
						endurance of hardships and sacrifice for ideals. They are regarded as disinterested
						pioneers prompted by the highest motives and inspired with the lofty desire of carrying
						civilization to barbarian peoples. Nothing is farther from the truth than this. "It is
						but a survival of the barbarian past to regard great historic names, not only as
						brilliant leaders, but also as demigods, though such opinions are still prevalent among
						many learned as well as ignorant men."<ref id="ref_014" target="note_014" rend="super"
							>1</ref> Columbus was only one of a number of navigators who were seeking a new trade
						route to India. The march of the Mohammedan hordes to the north out of Africa had been
						going on for more than two centuries, when finally in the middle of the fifteenth
						century Constantinople fell into their hands and blocked the trade routes to India. The
						merchant traders had to seek new trade routes for their merchandise, and it was while
						seeking a westward route that Columbus made his discovery. The lure of profits, not the
						love of adventure, was the primal cause of the navigators venturing out into unknown
						seas.</p>
					<p>Events that followed the landing of the white man on the American continent also
						confirm this view. The era of colonization is an era of conquest, pillage, enslavement
						and robbery, the victims being the Indians and the great mass of pauperized workers
						crowding European shores. Columbus himself bears testimony to the sordid motives that
						guided his policies in the New World. Writing of the natives of one of the Bahama group
						of islands he informs the king that "Their conversation is the sweetest <note

						so affectionate are they that I swear to your highness there is not a better people in
						the world."<ref id="ref_015" target="note_015" rend="super">2</ref> Yet in his memorial
						of the second voyage to the Indies, dated January 30, 1494, and addressed to Ferdinand
						and Isabella, Columbus called attention to the prospects for gold in the island and to
						the Indians as a good source of slave labor. He asks for "cattle, provisions and other
						articles" which may be "sold at moderate prices for account of the bearers; and the
						latter might be paid with slaves, taken from among the Caribbees, who are a wild people
						fit for any work, . . . who will be better than any other kind of slaves."<ref
							id="ref_016" target="note_016" rend="super">3</ref> The advice did not fall on deaf

					<p>However, in colonizing new countries, a ruling class is face to face with a problem
						that forces this conquest of barbarous peoples. The capitalist system can only gain a
						foothold in any new country by compulsory labor of one form or another. In the home
						countries the ruling classes are in possession of institutions based on thousands of
						years of history. Land and other forms of production are in the hands of the ruling
						classes and there is no alternative for the workers but to work and produce surplus
						incomes for others. Custom, tradition, the schoolmaster and the church have in the
						meantime played their part in making these workers resigned to their fate, either as one
						that is the decree of an all-wise providence, or of natural laws which to oppose would
						be folly. Their fathers had been poor, law and religion sanctioned it, and every
						educational agency had so perverted their perception of their interests that they not
						only accepted their fate but shed their blood in behalf of those who lived on their
						toil. The workers were conquered, intellectually and morally.</p>

					<p>But in new countries the institutions of class rule are absent. What exists is a virgin
						island or continent with natural resources awaiting the skill of men to transform them
						into the forms that serve the wants of mankind. The rivers and lakes, forests and
						harbors, fields and deposits lack the basic character of civilization: that is, they are
						not the property of a class. Hence, if wealth is to be accumulated in such countries the
						possessor thereof must acquire it by toil. If accumulation through ownership is to be
						realized&mdash;and this is the "ideal" of capitalist society&mdash; the land must be
						seized and thus, by abolishing self-employment, enforced labor will be secured. "Law and
						order," with all its accessories, such as police, judges, armies, etc., will naturally
						follow to guard the conquest against the protests of the propertyless. This has been the
						historic process in every new country, including America.</p>
					<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that advance agents of the merchant fleecers of
						Europe, like Columbus, facing the alternative of either working themselves or enslaving
						others, should choose the latter course. Besides, they left the old world with other
						visions than a life of hardship and wealth acquired by hazardous toil. "Most of them
						were adventurers, who had embarked with no other expectation than that of getting
						together a fortune as speedily as possible in the Golden Indies. . . From the first
						moment of their landing in Hispainiola they indulged the most wanton license in regard
						to the unoffending natives, who in the simplicity of their hearts received the white men
						as messengers from heaven. In less than four years . . . one-third of its population,
						amounting probably to several hundred thousands, were sacrificed! Such were the

						man and the simple natives of the Western world."<ref id="ref_018" target="note_018"

					<p>Unless the worker is enslaved or the masters make it difficult for him to have access
						to natural resources he will occupy the land, which costs nothing, rather than hire out
						to others and produce a surplus for them. If the capitalist could export all his
						institutions to the colonies, if he could call into existence almost over night private
						possession of resources and have police and military power to enforce obedience, he
						could start with what he calls "free labor"&mdash;that is, labor dependent on him in the
						beginning. This being impossible all the twaddle about "free labor," which his
						intellectual police chant, is abandoned and the land is forcibly taken and slavery is
						introduced. These economic difficulties that faced the merchant adventurers in
						colonizing the New World, started them on their career of plunder. "The discovery of
						gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement, and entombment in mines of the
						aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the
						turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signalized
						the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production."<ref id="ref_020" target="note_020"

					<p>The rulers of the Old World solved the question of conquering the New and securing
						slave labor in a characteristic fashion. They simply granted great tracts of land to
						broken-down court favorites and adventurers, transported their helpless paupers as
						slaves to America, and early in the seventeenth century began to raid Africa,
						transforming that country into a bloody shambles to secure further supplies of slave
						labor. We will notice the land policy first. It was easy to deprive the workers of the
						soil and make them dependent by giving the land outright to chartered companies of
						speculators. The charters usually gave exclusive powers of sovereignty over the domains
						within the royal grants and rendered workmen dependent vassals. All of the colonies were
						settled by these chartered monopolies. Just as the English ruling class confiscated the
						common lands and enclosed vast estates and transformed the laborers into vagabonds, so
						the land was <note id="note_020"><ref target="ref_020" rend="super">7</ref> Marx,
							"Capital," Vol. I, p. 479, Humbolt Edition.</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-020" n="20"/> taken from beneath the feet of the workers here. Many of
						the fortunes of settlement times came from these monopolies. The first charter of
						Virginia, granted by King James in 1606, may be cited as an example of the exclusive
						powers and privileges given to these adventurers.</p>
					<p>This grant included an extensive domain along the Atlantic coast for over two hundred
						miles and inland one hundred miles, as well as the islands within one hundred miles of
						the coast. The grant provided that the adventurers should have "all the lands, woods,
						soil, grounds, havens, ports, rivers, mines, marshes, waters, fishings, commodities, and
						hereditaments whatsoever." It further provided that no others would be permitted "to
						plant or inhabit behind, or on the back side of them, toward the main land, without the
						express license or consent of the Council of that Colony." They are granted the right to
						fortify their territory; to resist and expel on sea or land any person or persons who
						attempt to inhabit their domains or to annoy them in any way. They are empowered to
						confiscate any person or persons, ship or ships, vessels, goods and other furniture,
						which shall be found trading or trafficking in any harbor, creek or place within the
						limits of the plantation until they pay two and a half upon every hundred of anything by
						them trafficked, bought or sold. The loot realized from this legalized piracy went to
						the adventurers for the first twenty-one years; after that they sent it to the king.
						They were also exempted from paying any duties levied by the home government.<ref
							id="ref_021" target="note_021" rend="super">8</ref> Corporate privileges more sweeping
						than these can scarcely be imagined.</p>
					<p>The empire of these favorites extended from the mouth of the Hudson river to the
						southern boundary of North Carolina. John Smith catalogues those going to Virginia as
						"poor gentlemen, tradesmen, serving-men, and libertines." The workers, of course, were
						not included in the grant of privileges, as they invariably came as bond slaves of the
						"idle and dissolute adventurers, attracted <note id="note_021"><ref target="ref_021"

						World and share in the task of clearing the wilderness and making civilization possible.
						They left their wives and children at home in the expectation of returning soon with
						sufficient wealth to live a life of ease. The company was simply a commercial
						corporation, the main object of its existence being to swell the incomes of the
						shareholders. Much is said by historians regarding the religious ideals which they
						assume inspired many to come to America. But whatever religious motives may have
						possessed the ruling classes and the adventurers it is certain that these served as a
						convenient shield for the visions of plunder that dominated their lives. Thirteen years
						after the founding of the colony a Dutch ship sailed into Jamestown and sold the first
						black slaves to Virginia planters. The same year, 1619, young girls were shipped from
						England and sold as wives in Jamestown for 120 pounds of tobacco, or about $80 each. A
						load of convicts also came and were sold into servitude. In 1692 an incident occurred
						that throws some light on the holy aspirations of the land conquerors. "When a
						delegation from Virginia were soliciting a charter for the College of William and Mary,
						on the ground that a higher education was necessary as a step towards the salvation of
						souls by the clergy, he (Attorney General Seymour) blurted out: 'Souls! Damn your souls!
						grow tobacco!' "<ref id="ref_023" target="note_023" rend="super">10</ref></p>
					<p>Virginia became a class aristocracy, composed of an idle, fox-chasing, cock-fighting,
						gambling, drinking, ruling class; served by black and white servile labor, controlling
						church and state, establishing customs, forming current opinions and ruling all classes
						below it; a society that had little to command our admiration and still less to elicit
						the praise of historians.</p>
					<p>In 1681 Charles II gave William Penn a proprietary charter of 40,000 square miles in
						America to liquidate a claim Penn's father, an admiral in the British navy, held against
						the government. It was a habit in those days for <note id="note_022"><ref

						friends by extensive grants of land and these grants sometimes included land already
						given to other Englishmen. These conflicting grants frequently caused endless quarreling
						between rival claimants. It was an easy method of paying debts or advancing royal
						favorites. It cost kings nothing and only placed the poor, who emigrated to the New
						World, into the hands of the land kings. Penn proved to be one of the world's greatest
						land speculators and a promoter of trade in white slaves on a colossal scale, as we
						shall see in another chapter. Although the rule of Penn was mild compared with the
						southern colonies, the conditions under which the vagrant poor made the voyage to the
						colony were in some respects more inhuman than that which developed with the black slave
							trade.<ref id="ref_024" target="note_024" rend="super">11</ref></p>
					<p>In 1682 a pamphlet, the authoriship of which is ascribed to Penn, appeared. This was
						followed by many others, all of them being distributed throughout Europe, but especially
						in Germany. One authority passes the following judgment on the first document mentioned:
						"The scheme here proposed is to induce men of wealth to take up large tracts of land,
						and to encourage those of little or no means <hi rend="i">to settle thereon for the
							benefit of the rich."</hi><ref id="ref_025" target="note_025" rend="super">12</ref>
						The pamphlet was carefully written and the terms of settlement for the poor stated in
						language that would appeal to them. The emigrant was given to understand that here was a
						rare opportunity to escape the oppression of the Old World and win economic
						independence. "The dark side of colonial life&mdash;subduing the forest, the constant
						fear of savages, the want of facilities incident to a sparse population&mdash;was not
						represented to them in the mass of literature which advertised the new colonies. For
						unfavorable reports were carefully suppressed by those whose interests lay in the

						the scheme because of the large profits in it. The agents were known as "Neulanders"
						(Newlanders), who received a commission for every one they induced to make the voyage.
						They resorted to many tricks and devices to increase their incomes. They dressed well
						and paraded gaudy jewelry to impress their victims with the belief that gold and
						opulence were easily obtained in America. Letters entrusted to the Neulanders to friends
						in Europe were opened and if they contained the truth as to conditions in the colonies
						they were rewritten by the sharks. Abbe Raynal, writing of these infamous practices,
						said: "Simple men seduced by these magnificent promises blindly follow these infamous
						brokers engaged in this scandalous commerce."<ref id="ref_027" target="note_027"
							rend="super">14</ref></p>
					<p>The drain on the population of Germany became large enough to rouse the resentment of
						the ruling classes who feared an undersupply of laborers and a rise in wages as a
						consequence. Literature giving a more accurate account of conditions in America was
						spread broadcast and laws passed prohibiting the trade of the emigration agents. A
						colonial newspaper in 1751 contained the following announcement: "The Elector Palatine

					<p>New Netherlands (later New York) was perhaps the nearest approach to the establishment
						of a feudal regime in America, and remnants of the feudal privileges granted early in
						the seventeenth century survived the first quarter of the nineteenth century. This
						province, like Virginia, became a class aristocracy, though, unlike the latter, black
						slaves did not play any large part in its history. New Netherlands constituted the
						section of land that the ruling class of Holland, through its States General, took for
						itself. The Dutch West India company, a chartered corporation of Holland, decided in
						1629 to give "any member of the company founding a colony of fifty persons the right to
						an estate with a river frontage of sixteen miles, and of otherwise indefinite extent,
						while with these estates went every sort of feudal right, including manorial courts and
						the privilege of trading within the dominions of the company."<ref id="ref_030"
							target="note_030" rend="super">17</ref> The title was made perpetual and the monopoly
						of trade exclusive except that in furs. . . . In these grants the resources of wealth
						and political power are given with a stroke of the pen to the proprietors. It required
						no iron collar about the neck of the worker to emphasize his status as a serf under
						these grants. Out of these little land kingdoms sprang a powerful landed class with
						mighty estates along the banks of the Hudson, surrounding themselves with courts in
						imitation of the ruling princes of the Old World.</p>
					<p>Six years later still greater privileges are granted to the adventurers. Anyone
						establishing a colony of forty-eight adults is given six years to pay. No one could
						approach within eight miles of the grant without the proprietor's consent. "He and he
						only was the court with summary powers . . . which were harshly or capriciously
						exercised. Not only did he impose sentence for violation of laws, but he, himself,

						of policing his domain."<ref id="ref_031" target="note_031" rend="super">18</ref></p>
					<p>The only redress the workers on these domains had was to appeal to the New Netherlands
						Council, but the adventurers generally succeeded in avoiding this by binding the
						settlers before starting out not to exercise this right.<ref id="ref_032"
							target="note_032" rend="super">19</ref> It is not surprising, therefore, that the land
						kings "encased themselves in an environment of pomp and awe. Like so many petty monarchs
						each had his distinct flag and insignia; each fortified his domain with fortresses,
						armed with cannon and manned by his paid soldiery."<ref id="ref_033" target="note_033"
							rend="super">20</ref> Neither are we surprised that any man or woman servant could not
						leave the master if the latter violated the terms of the contract, or that the master
						"forced his tenants to sign covenants that they should trade in nothing than the produce

						grind their flour at his mill, and buy bread at his bakery, lumber at his sawmills and
						liquor at his brewery."<ref id="ref_034" target="note_034" rend="super">21</ref></p>
					<p>This work of seizing the land as fast as the laborers could be shipped to America
						placed the latter as securely in the grasp of a colonial ruling class as the evictions
						from the common lands in Europe did the workers there. In addition to the confiscation
						was the bond slavery of thousands enforced by the voyage to the colonies. We reserve the
						discussion of this white slavery for another chapter. It remains for us to briefly
						consider a few of the other royal grants that established broken libertines,
						adventurers, and speculators as masters over the workers.</p>
					<p>In 1629 Charles I granted to Lord Baltimore and his heirs the present state of

						<pb id="VAC1311-026" n="26"/> Maryland society became similar to Virginia, though it may
						be said that the ruling class of both colonies did not make any pretensions of democracy
						such as the Puritan aristocracy of New England did. In Maryland there was a savage law
						code against the black slaves while the white slaves included imported convicts who
						worked on the roads in gangs, loaded with irons, and were frequently employed in
						building houses for the great planters. The other white slaves were kidnaped in Europe,
						a "business" which we will discuss later. Those who made the voyage to Maryland of their
						own accord, were usually the victims of the emigration agents who falsified the
						contracts and added to the terms of servitude.<ref id="ref_036" target="note_036"

					<p>The Maryland clergy aped and served the ruling class with a degree of servility perhaps
						unequaled in any other colony. It was no uncommon thing for them to be found drunk or to
						extort marriage fees from the poor and refusing to go on with the ceremony until their
						demands were granted. They "set decency and public opinion at defiance. They hunted,
						raced horses, drank, gambled, and were the boon companions of the wealthy planters. . .
						. They became a by-word in the other colonies, and every itinerant clergyman who was a
						low fellow and a disgrace to his profession passed under the cant name of a 'Maryland
							parson.'"<ref id="ref_037" target="note_037" rend="super">24</ref> With land and

						were not in a species of slavery yet to be discussed.</p>
					<p>In 1629 Charles I granted North Carolina to his attorney general, as "the province of
						Carolana," on condition that he should colonize it within a reasonable time. The
						condition was not complied with, but settlers, who by 1663 had purchased land from
						Indians, were robbed by Charles II, who gave the territory to eight royal favorites,
						"gentlemen who had done him inestimable services." The following year the speculators

						west as the Pacific.<ref id="ref_038" target="note_038" rend="super">25</ref> This
						colony developed the most atrocious type of slavery, a type that scarcely had a
						redeeming feature. The cultivation of rice and indigo in the swamp lands of the colony
						proved deadly to white men, so that early in the eighteenth century the demand for black
						slaves was enormous. By 1765 they numbered more than 100,000. In one year the slave
						would produce more rice than sufficed to pay his value. In other words, <hi rend="i">it
							became profitable to work the slaves to death.</hi> The rich planters did not live on
						the plantations in the swamps, but retired to Charleston, leaving overseers in charge.
						The slaves became prematurely old, presenting a marked contrast to the slaves of the
						other colonies. In Charleston the masters lived a life of ease attended by slaves,
						drinking, gambling, and attending dinners, balls and concerts. Their lives were

					<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century land speculating companies came into existence.

						land and transforming great estates of fertile soil into sheep pastures. The gulf

					<p>There were several classes of these slaves and<note id="note_048"><ref target="ref_048"

						<pb id="VAC1311-032" n="32"/> perhaps the best general description of their servitude is
						given by the historian, McMaster. After describing the status of the black slaves he
						says:</p>
					<p>"One step above the slaves were the convict bond-servants, or men and women in a state
						of temporary involuntary servitude. These people were either political offenders or
						felon convicts. Those guilty of political offenses, as the Scots taken in battle in
						1650, the prisoners captured at the battle of Worcester in 1651. Monmouth's men, 1685,
						the Scots concerned in the uprising of 1678, the Jacobins of 1716, the Scots who went
						out in 1745, were, of course, of this class of offenders; and during that period,
						between 1650 and 1745, as many as four thousand are known to have been sent over to this
						country.</p>
					<p>"The felons formed the great source of supply, and had been sent over in very
						considerable numbers from the earliest days of colonization. . . . One historian of
						Maryland declares that up to the Revolution twenty thousand came to that colony and half
						of them after 1750. Another authority . . . asserts that between 1715 and 1775, ten
						thousand felons were exported from the Old Bailey Prison in London. . . .</p>
					<p>"But the indentured servant and redemptioner did not cease to come when the colonies
						became the United States. Speaking generally, the indentured servants were men, women
						and even children, who, unable to pay their passage, signed a contract called an
							indenture<ref id="ref_050" target="note_050" rend="super">3</ref> before leaving the
						Old World. This indenture bound the owner or master of the ship to transport them to
						America, and bound the emigrant after arrival in America to serve the owner, or their
						assigns, for a certain number of years. On reaching port the owner or master, whose
						servants they then became, <hi rend="i">sold them for their passage to the highest
							bidder, or for what he could get.</hi></p>
					<p>"The redemptioner, on the other hand, was an immigrant who signed no indenture before
						embarking, but agreed<note id="note_050"><ref target="ref_050" rend="super">3</ref> The
							name comes from the practice of tearing the contract into two halves, with jagged
							edges; the master kept one and the slave the other.</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-033" n="33"/> with the shipping merchant that after reaching America he
						should be given a certain time (generally a month) in which to find somebody to redeem
						him by paying the passage money, or freight, as it was called. Should he fail to find a
						redeemer within a specified time, <hi rend="i">the ship captain was at liberty to sell
							him to the highest bidder....</hi></p>
					<p>"When a ship laden with one to three hundred such persons arrived, we will say at
						Philadelphia, the immigrants, arranged in a long line, were marched at once to a
						magistrate and forced to take an oath of allegiance to the king or, later, to the United
						States, and then marched back to the ship to be sold. If a purchaser was not forthcoming
						. . . <hi rend="i">they were frequently sold to speculators<ref id="ref_051"
								target="note_051" rend="super">4</ref> who drove them, chained together sometimes
							through the country, from farm to farm, in search of a purchaser.</hi></p>
					<p>"The contract signed, the newcomer became in the eyes of the law a slave, and in both
						the civil and criminal code was classed with negro slaves and Indians. None could marry
						without consent of the master or mistress under penalty of an addition of one year's
						service to the time set forth in the indenture. They were worked hard, were dressed in
						the cast-off clothes of their owners, <hi rend="i">and might be flogged as often as the
							master or mistress thought necessary. . . . Father, mother and children could be sold
							to different buyers."</hi><ref id="ref_052" target="note_052" rend="super">5</ref></p>
					<p>The only difference between these white slaves, sold in American ports, and the blacks
						was that the slavery of the whites was limited and the blacks were slaves for life. The
						white slaves were sold in all the colonies, though New England's supply was smaller than
						the middle and southern colonies. It may be said with truth that both black and white
						slaves formed the basis of the landed aristocracy <note id="note_051"><ref

						this fact is suppressed by most historians in order that historic figures, who witnessed
						the auction of white laborers without a protest, and some of whom were interested in the
						traffic, might be glorified. It was a modified form of chattel slavery and admirably
						served the purposes of the classes who confiscated the land or inherited it from those
						who did. With the resources of life in their hands and whites and blacks held in
						servitude, the ruling classes had all the advantages that the masters of any age might
						wish.</p>
					<p>But we have not exhausted our review of the life of these forgotten white slaves in

						"Boston, Sept. 26, 1642," and gives an account of the experience and needs of the

						and transport over poore children, Boyes and Girles, which may be a great mercy to their
						bodies and soules."<ref id="ref_053" target="note_053" rend="super">6</ref> It would

					<p>To be sure that "democracy" was securely established in Massachusetts the colonial

						that "There shall be no bond slaverie (!) Villinage of Captivitie amongst us unless it
						be lawfull captives taken in just warres, and such strangers as willingly (!!) selle

						appreciate these "liberties."</p>
					<p>The fact that white servitude was not as general in New England as in the colonies, to
						the south, does not necessarily mean that "free labor" was allowed to reap the reward of
						high wages that usually comes of a scarcity of labor. <hi rend="i">The Puritan
							aristocracy met this scarcity by fixing wages by law.</hi> As early as 1633
						Massachusetts Bay colony adopted a statute commanding that carpenters, sawyers, masons,
						bricklayers, tilers, joiners, wheelwrights, mowers and other workmen were not to receive
						more than two shillings per day, each paying his own board, or if furnished with living
						they might receive fourteen pence per day. The constable and two others associated with
						him was to fix the rates of pay of inferior workmen in the same occupations. Other
						classes of workmen also had their wages fixed by law. An employer who paid more than the
						legal rates, as he would be tempted to do during a brisk demand for labor, or the
						workman who accepted wages higher than the legal rate, were both subjected to penalties
						for violating the law. Lest these regulations might provoke <note id="note_057"><ref

						<pb id="VAC1311-036" n="36"/> the workers to refuse to work at all the "virtues" of
						thrift and industry were encouraged by providing that there should be no idleness, and
						the workman who indulged in this peculiar privilege of the aristocracy was subjected to
						a penalty fixed by law.</p>
					<p>One year after the passage of this act there was an increase in the demand for labor
						and the clause penalizing the employers for paying wages higher than the legal rates was
						repealed. The towns were then authorized to appoint a board of three men to fix wages
						when the employers and workmen failed to agree. As the workers had no political power it
						is evident that the town boards always represented the masters and any interference was
						seldom to their disadvantage. While the employers were exempt from penalties for
						violating the act <hi rend="i">the workmen continued to be fined.</hi> The law was later
						repealed, but another took its place in 1636 giving towns jurisdiction in fixing wages.
						But in 1640 prices collapsed and there was danger of the workers reaping some benefits
						from the lower prices. The colonial legislature then went over the heads of the towns
						and <hi rend="i">commanded the workmen to reduce wages to correspond with reduced
							prices</hi> and those who failed to respond were fined as usual.<ref id="ref_059"
							target="note_059" rend="super">12</ref></p>
					<p>Work was plenty in New England and laborers were not sufficient to serve the needs of
						the employing class. The real wage was low as "the workingman was obliged to pay
						comparatively high prices"<ref id="ref_060" target="note_060" rend="super">13</ref> for
						everything. Agricultural laborers received wages from 1752 to 1760 averaging thirty-one

						On the eve of the Revolution (1774) the wages in the colonies were about seven

					<p>Although black and white slave labor were not abundant in New England, the policy of
						fixing wages by law gave the ruling classes all the cheap labor they desired. These
						facts compel one conservative historian to admit that "An aristocracy unquestionably
						existed in New England from the beginning, always possessing great power, and fully
							recognized."<ref id="ref_062" target="note_062" rend="super">15</ref> Yet Carroll D.
						Wright asserts that "The colonists secured one thing which the workingman appreciated.
						They were free (?) men; they were not tied to the soil, such servitude which had wrought
						great evil under the feudal system being utterly forbidden."<ref id="ref_063"
							target="note_063" rend="super">16</ref> He also regards this legislation as a sort of
						mania rather than an example of class rule by the wealthy. Yet this mania for keeping
						down the wages of the workers through the agency of courts, constables, fines and foul
						prisons did not extend to a like regulation of the incomes of the wealthy classes. On
						this point the aristocracy was perfectly "sane." The "mania" in this instance was "get
						all you can." But this fact has no significance for the late labor commissioner of the
						United States.</p>
					<p>What has been said of "free labor" in New England is true in large measure of the same
						class of workmen in the other colonies. We have dwelt upon it at some length because of
						the persistent advertising of New England as "the cradle of democracy in America." We
						shall later see these Puritan upstarts engaging in the slave trade while denouncing
						slavery; developing smuggling as a fine art, and establishing vile prisons for poor
						laborers unable to pay their debts. For the present we return to a consideration of the
						unfortunate white laborers who were bought and sold in the colonies.</p>
					<p>There is abundant evidence to show that the life of the indentured slaves was hard and
						cruel. In fact, some of the legislation applying to them recalls the bloody legislation
						against the poor in the Old World. There are, of course, some works that have come down
						to us that give a favorable picture of the life of these slaves, but in most <note

						<pb id="VAC1311-038" n="38"/> cases these works were written by those interested in the
						white slave trade or their agents and are, therefore, untrustworthy. Lucy Maynard Salmon
						in her excellent book<ref id="ref_064" target="note_064" rend="super">17</ref> mentions
						a number of these works. The fact that today glowing accounts are sent by ship agents
						and capitalist firms to European countries advertising alleged opportunities in America,
						indicates that modern sweaters are merely following the example of the Puritan slavers
						of two centuries ago.</p>
					<p>The laws directed against disobedience and misdemeanors of white slaves were rigorous.
						Those calling for the severest punishments were generally offenses against
						property&mdash;the God of capitalist civilization. In Virginia, in 1610, pilfering on
						the part of launderers, laundresses, bakers, cooks and dressers of fish is punished with
						whipping and imprisonment; for purloining flour and meal given out for baking purposes,
							<hi rend="i">offenders have their ears sliced off;</hi> for the second offense a year
						imprisonment and for the third offense, three years. This brutal treatment produced a
						reaction and by 1700 laws were being enacted prescribing limits to the punishment
						allowed and in some cases providing penalties for violation of the acts. The laws
						included better provision for their food, clothing, shelter and medical attendance;
						against bodily maiming, whipping without the consent of the proper authorities and other
						regulations which throw considerable light on the treatment they were subjected to.</p>
					<p>Fugitive slave laws as applied to these slaves were a part of the legislation in all
						colonies. The laws generally provided penalties for both fugitives and those who gave
						them shelter or aided them in any way to escape. The penalty for fugitives generally
						included an addition to their terms of servitude which varied in each colony.
						Advertisements appear in all the colonial newspapers. The following from the Virginia
							<hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> (Williamsburg), July 14, 1737, may be cited as an example of
						hundreds:</p>
					<p>"Ran away some time in June last from William <note id="note_064"><ref target="ref_064"

					<p>It will be noted that this woman serf had her initials and the date when she was
						purchased branded on her right arm.</p>
					<p>There was always the temptation for masters to harbor runaway slaves because of the
						scarcity of labor and each colony prescribed penalties&mdash;generally fines&mdash;for
						offenders. Maryland punished slaves, who aided fugitives, with lashes, not to exceed
						thirty-nine, on the bare back. The colonial legislatures also provided standing rewards,
						some payable in cash, others in cloth or tobacco, to those who aided in the capture of
						runaways. Fugitive and disobedient servants, as they were usually called, suffered
						humiliating corporal punishment prescribed by law. This generally took the form of
						public whipping, the number of lashes being prescribed as in the case of North Carolina
						where the justice of the peace directs the constable to give strokes "not exceeding the

					<p>We have already mentioned that these bond slaves worked on the highways of Maryland in

						this colony they were generally worked without mercy. A document written in 1679 states

						surprising that runaways were numerous. In fact, they became so frequent that it became
						hazardous for anyone to venture on a journey, especially if poorly clothed, as it was
						the custom of sheriffs to lock such suspicious characters up. They were then advertised
						in the papers and in some cases if no owner was found within a certain time, <hi

					<p>We shall later see a similar clause in the Constitution of the United States which we
						have every reason to believe applied to white as well as black slaves.</p>
					<p>There is abundant testimony to indicate that the aristocracy in many respects not only
						regarded some classes of white slaves as beneath the blacks, but that the latter also,
						in some cases, felt a sense of superiority. One authority says: "The negro slave might

					<p>In Pennsylvania fugitives received five days additional servitude for every day of

						provided for marrying without the master's consent, and women having illegitimate

					<p>For trifling offences the masters were able to prolong the period of servitude fixed in

					<p>In Georgia the slave code was similar to North Carolina and Virginia. The white slaves
						of Georgia and other colonies frequently escaped to the Spanish border and led a wild
						barbarous life, repaying their former masters with brigandage and robbery. When these
						vagabonds were captured whipping, branding irons, and the pillory were employed to teach
						them the error of their ways. But the Georgia border continued to be a turbulent section
						even after the Revolution. It was from these white bond slaves that the mass of "poor
						whites" in the mountain districts of the South were recruited. Owing to the existence of
						negro slavery to work for a living became a badge of shame and the "poor whites," long
						after the redemptionist and indentured system disappeared, were still regarded as
						mudsills by the slave-owning aristocracy and were shunned as though they were beasts. In
						fact, before the Civil war, it was no unusual thing for a slave owner to hire out his
						negroes to other employers for <hi rend="i">terms much higher than what the poor whites
							could get.</hi> A few examples will suffice. "Sober, energetic white men, engaged in

						without ever owning so much as five dollars. "Thousands of them die at an advanced age,

						the nineteenth century by the "fathers" of the American government.</p>
					<p>It may not be amiss here to state that many men who were prominent in the Revolution
						profited from this system of servile white labor. For example, George Washington, in
						1774, wrote a ship captain expressing his desire for a supply of servants to place on
						his Ohio lands. He writes of his desire to import them at his expense, "where they are
						unable to transport themselves, into the Potomac river, and from hence to the Ohio; to
						have them, in the first case, engaged to me under indenture, in the second, by some
						other contract equally valid, to become tenants upon the terms hereafter mentioned." <hi
							rend="i">The terms suggested are that the slaves jointly bind themselves to reimburse
							Washington for any losses he might sustain by deaths or accidents.</hi><ref
							id="ref_077" target="note_077" rend="super">30</ref> This proposed toll of death or
						disease was probably suggested by the inhuman practices of the ship captains engaged in
						the white slave trade, which is reviewed in the next chapter. The most grasping of
						modern sweaters could not ask for more iron-clad terms from his victims than those

						something in the world. The period of slavery, carrying with it the shame and
						humiliation of a subject class, left most of them dull and shiftless when they were
						released. Out of their sufferings and those of the blacks arose the aristocracy of
						Southern planters, the New York land kings, and the fishing, commercial and

					<p>Prof. Marion Dexter Learned of the University of Pennsylvania in his book, "Abraham

					<p>During the American Revolution the white slaves as well as the blacks were a source of

						times the slaves would desert their owners and fight with the British. The officers of
						the British army were not slow to take advantage of the situation and offer inducements
						to the servile population to join in the struggle to subdue the colonial masters. Lord
						Dunmore, governor of Virginia, in 1775, published a proclamation declaring martial law

					<p>No doubt many took advantage of the British offer of freedom, but thousands also joined
						the American forces to escape the service of their masters, believing that independence
						would also bring freedom. A law of Virginia was enacted&mdash;perhaps to counteract the
						effect of Dunmore's proclamation&mdash;providing that all white servants would be freed

							>37</ref> It was the farmers, laborers and bond slaves who made up the bulk of the
						fighting forces under Washington and his generals. Ida M. Tarbell, in her story of "The
						American Woman,"<ref id="ref_085" target="note_085" rend="super">38</ref> tells of a
						"bound girl," Deborah Sampson Gannett, who used the first money she earned at teaching
						to buy cloth with which she made herself a suit of men's clothing and enlisted in the
						army under the name of Robert Shurtleff. Wounded twice, her sex was not discovered until

					<p>The Revolution brought few changes for the better for white slaves. The traffic in them
						continued and the laws affecting them remained on the whole about the same. What few

					<p>The general character of this white bond service may be seen from the following written
						in 1770 by William Eddis an English traveler in America and for eight years a
						resident:</p>
					<p>"Negroes," he writes, "being a property for life, the death of slaves, in the prime of
						youth or strength, is a material loss to the proprietor; they are, therefore, almost in

						(immigrant) over whom the rigid planter exercises an inflexible severity. They are
						strained to the utmost to perform their allotted labour; and, from a prepossession in
						many cases too justly founded, they are supposed to be receiving only the just reward
						which is due to repeated offenses. There are doubtless many exceptions to this
						observation, yet, generally speaking, they groan beneath a worse than Egyptian bondage.
						By attempting to lighten the intolerable burthen, they often render it more
						insupportable. For real or imaginary causes, these frequently attempt to escape, but
						very few are successful; the country being intersected with rivers, and the utmost
						vigilance observed in detecting persons under suspicious circumstances, who, when

						incurred, and supposed inconveniences resulting from a desertion of duty."<ref
							id="ref_090" target="note_090" rend="super">43</ref></p>
					<p>This general subjection of white immigrant laborers, together with the kidnaped blacks,
						was a factor second in importance to the conquest of natural resources in making a
						ruling class possible. Both gave wealth, power and influence to an aristocracy in all
						the colonies and, together with political privileges based on the ownership of property,
						placed the governing powers in the hands of the masters so that the legislation of the
						colonial period reflects the property interests that ruled. Cheap slave labor was
						essential to the continuance of class rule until the control of natural resources had
						extended far enough to permit the system of indentured service to die. With such control
						the masters could gradually release white slaves in a market fairly well stocked with
						"free laborers" compelled to compete with each other for employment.</p>
					<p>Of course, there was the western frontier for the oppressed to move to, but here also
						there were two factors at work, after the passing of indentured service as well as
						before it, which made the free lands of the West largely a myth of the historians. One
						was the continued confiscation or acquirement by fraud or bribery of the western lands
						by land speculators and land corporations and the consequent exploitation of the more
						daring and rebellious who advanced into the wilderness. The second was the policy of the
						colonial rulers in dealing with the Indians. The frontier settlements were continually
						exposed to attacks by Indians and massacres frequently took place. The aristocracy
						controlling the legislatures, before and after the Revolution, seldom provided the
						military protection these settlements required. In 1794 the settlers at Lexington,
						Kentucky, adopted revolutionary resolutions, <note id="note_090"><ref target="ref_090"

						of the United States government."<ref id="ref_091" target="note_091" rend="super"
							>44</ref> Early in the same year a debate in congress disclosed the miserable wages
						paid even those who engaged in protecting the frontier. "Each private at that time

							rend="i">His hire was three dollars a month."</hi><ref id="ref_092" target="note_092"
							rend="super">45</ref></p>
					<p>This wretched remuneration was calculated to discourage enlistments for frontier duty.
						The "free laborer," therefore, had the alternative of staying within reach of the
						masters and working for them, or moving out into the forests to incur the danger of
						massacre by savage foes. In other words, <hi rend="i">the ruling classes preferred to

							scarcely guaranteed subsistence.</hi> This frontier policy was one cause of "Bacon's
						Rebellion" in 1676, which we will consider in another chapter.</p>
					<p>The conquest of land and laborers, together with this military policy, made the triumph
						of the ruling classes nearly complete. Before leaving the subject it is necessary to

						the slavers brought negroes to America and one as atrocious as the commerce in these

					<head rend="center b">The White Slave Trade</head>
					<p>Few people today know or even suspect that a slave trade in white men, transported to
						America, reached large proportions in our early history. It is one of those unpleasant
						facts which historians prefer to dwell on briefly or not at all, so that he who wishes
						to know the extent and character of this commerce must consult a dreary mass of
						historical documents and even then must piece together the fragments of information
						which his research reveals. And yet any view of our history, including the colonial era
						and the half century that followed independence, that does not include a knowledge of
						the gains of this traffic; the sufferings of the victims in the voyage to America; the
						methods employed to induce them to emigrate; the brutality of the slavers who engaged in
						it, and the servitude the workers endured in America, is a view as distorted as though
						one were to describe the wealthy residence section of New York today and hand this view
						on to posterity as a faithful picture of present civilization. This latter view would
						leave out of consideration the East Side with its millions in tenement hells and
						sweatshops, the bread lines, the unemployed, and the hand-to-mouth existence that other
						multitudes are forced to live.</p>
					<p>The historian is invariably a man whose associations and environment have formed an
						aristocratic type of mind which shrinks from revealing anything that reflects discredit
						on the "great men" of the past. The past must be vindicated in the interests of the
						class that today possesses resources originally secured by force, fraud and the
						servitude of workingmen. And it must be confessed that the writer who would tell the
						whole truth would pay the penalty by having his work killed by the literary police who
						pass judgment on current literature. It, therefore, happens that in addition to the
						habits, associations and training <pb id="VAC1311-051" n="51"/> which give a
						conservative cast to the mind of the historian, there is the safeguard that he will not
						become "sensational,"&mdash;that is to say, truthful&mdash;because of the penalty his
						folly would invite. Hence the history of colonial society has been written with one
						chapter usually left out, and that one more important than the silly gossip of some
						"statesman" or the love affairs of a colonial flirt. In considering the slave trade it
						has been the fashion to dwell entirely on the traffic in negroes, and as this traffic at
						one time or another was indulged in by the ruling classes of most modern nations, no
						special discredit attaches to America and its rulers. In fact, one may easily find
						graphic descriptions of the horrors of this trade. It is certainly revolting to know of
						the slave raids in Africa by men trained for their work; of the crowding of vessels with
						slaves to the limit of their capacity; how the stronger strangled the weaker to get more
						air; how the stench from below was so great that the slavers could not stand near the

					<p>The London company of adventurers who settled Virginia was eager to employ child labor

					<p>We have already mentioned the Neulanders and their work in Europe in stimulating
						emigration. Though they circulated stories of opportunities to be had in America they

						Advertising of various kinds was distributed broadcast and the emigration from Germany
						threatened to depopulate the provinces. The Neulanders received a commission for every
						person they pursuaded to emigrate, generally three florins or a ducat in Holland, while
						the merchant in Philadelphia sold them for sixty or eighty florins each in proportion to
						the debt incurred by the emigrant on the voyage. One Scotchman, in the middle of the

					<p>The atrocities which developed with the transportation of emigrants would be incredible
						were it not for the unimpeachable evidence collected in a few works. We have shown the
						kidnaping of blacks in Africa duplicated by the kidnaping of whites in Europe. The
						overcrowding of ships in the African slave trade, with its consequent horrors of
						epidemics of scurvy and small pox, deaths by starvation, smothering and violence, also
						had their counterpart in the white slave trade of American ship masters with Europe. In
						fact, some of the details of this traffic are sickening and are scarcely exceeded in
						cruelty by the deeds of barbarous peoples who lack the culture of civilization. The
						death of a black slave on the voyage to America meant a distinct loss to the slaver; but
						death did not always rob the ship captain of his profits on the white slave trade. The
						white slavers managed to collect a toll of death by providing that <hi rend="i"

							one-half of the journey, were held responsible for the debts of the
							deceased.''</hi><ref id="ref_102" target="note_102" rend="super">10</ref></p>
					<p>Not all those who left Europe did so with the intention of serving a period of years in
						the colonies to pay for their passage. Many of them after many sacrifices saved
						sufficient sums to pay the expense of the voyage. But ship captains, co-operating with
						Neulanders, contrived methods by which they robbed emigrants of their money and sold
						them into servitude to pay debts contracted on the voyage. In the journey from their
						homes to the ships tolls, fees and <note id="note_101"><ref target="ref_101"

						<pb id="VAC1311-055" n="55"/> duties were exacted on their baggage. The baggage itself,
						often containing money or valuables, was either stolen or sent by another boat leaving
						the emigrant at the mercy of the ship master. Enormous prices were also charged for
						meals so that the poor wretches thus swindled were sold on their arrival in America to
						pay for debts forced upon them. Even those whose funds were not exhausted by these
						practices had no guarantee that they would not be sold. <hi rend="i">"The well-to-do
							would have to pay for those who could not, or be themselves sold as
							redemptioners.</hi> This arrangement protected the captain against loss, in case a
						large number of redemptioners died on the way, and also gave him an excuse for
						extortions. The Germans of Philadelphia attempted to legislate against these abuses,
						beginning in 1750, but were for a long time unsuccessful, <hi rend="i">because of the

							>11</ref> It may be said in passing, in that day the payment of fare did not include
						board, and as the immigrant's provisions were often with his baggage, the theft of these
						left him at the mercy of his exploiters.</p>
					<p>However, this robbery, bad as it is, is humane compared with the terrible experience of
						these unfortunates on board the ships. Here the wretchedness growing out of the avarice
						of the slavers runs the gamut of human suffering. The large profits to be obtained from
						the traffic led to overcrowding. Almshouses and prisons were emptied to secure human
						merchandise for American employers. "The crowded exportation of Irish Catholics,"
						Bancroft writes, "was a frequent event, and was attended by aggravations hardly inferior
						to the usual atrocities of the African slave trade."<ref id="ref_104" target="note_104"
							rend="super">12</ref> Starvation and death from thirst were common occurrences. Ship

					<p>(The space allotted to the emigrants on board ship accounts for the frightful mortality

						spider's nests, are served to the starving. Hunger on one boat drove the starving men to
						break into the food apartment for which all the passengers were punished. The men
						received no bread and the women only one biscuit. Twenty men, women and children died of
						hunger. "The hunger was so great on board that all the bones about the ship . . . were

					<p>When these slave ships landed at Philadelphia or other ports the scenes were pathetic
						in the extreme. The immigrants are examined before the ship casts anchor. Those not

						packing cloth. . . . When they saw at our departure that we had not purchased, their
						countenances fell to that standard of stupid gloom which seemed to place them a link
						below rational beings."<ref id="ref_110" target="note_110" rend="super">18</ref></p>
					<p>As though the frightful conditions of the voyage were not sufficient to break the
						spirit of the victims of the slave trade, corporal punishment was administered for many
						offenses. Just how widespread this practice was cannot be determined with certainty, but
						that it prevailed there can be no doubt. John Harrower, a redemptioner, kept a diary
						from 1773 to 1776. He relates, among other things, the experience of a servant, Daniel
						Turner, who returned to the ship drunk, and for using abusive language toward two
						officers he was horsewhipped, "put in irons and thumb-screwed." One hour later he was
						released from the screws, taken out of the irons and bound and gagged for the remainder
						of the night.<ref id="ref_111" target="note_111" rend="super">19</ref></p>
					<p>The diseases contracted on the voyage by those whose destination was Philadelphia
						alarmed the inhabitants of that city. On the recommendation of Governor Thomas of
						Pennsylvania in 1742, an act was passed providing for the purchase of a site for a
						pest-house. Laws had been passed at an earlier period prohibiting the landing of
						convicts, lunatics and those infected with contagious diseases, but ship captains
						managed to smuggle these classes ashore during the night. <hi rend="i">Ship masters also

						wander from one place to another, without care, and to the manifest danger of the
						inhabitants." From this we would judge that the "grafters in high places" were still on
						good terms with the slavers and shared in the latter's spoils. More acts were passed,
						but were easily evaded or not enforced. "In the act of 1749, for example, which was
						primarily intended to prevent the importation of passengers in too great numbers in a
						single vessel by specifying the space that each passenger should have, no provision was
						made for the height of each berth. <hi rend="i">Vessels were still crowded as much as
							before the act was passed.</hi> To comply with the two dimensions specified by law,
						the berths were so constructed as to reduce the former height, thus giving no increase
						in the number of cubic feet per capita. On the whole the conditions through the middle
						of the century were bad. The increase of immigration brought with it an increase of
						disorder. <hi rend="i">The sick were neglected; contracts made in Europe between
							importers and passengers were disregarded; immigrants were sold into service to pay

					<head rend="center b">Rebellions of the Poor</head>
					<p>It need occasion no surprise if the economic, social and political status of the
						working people in our early history provoked revolts of both individuals and masses of
						the poor. Their lot on the whole was a desperate one and though rebellion generally
						brought savage retaliation, this knowledge did not deter them from hazarding an
						occasional blow at their exploiters. Deprived of education and lacking knowledge of the
						powers they had to contend with, these revolts were generally ineffective in securing
						any changes for the better until the dawn of the nineteenth century. The rebellions
						included all classes of workers such as the indentured servants, the redemptioners, the
						black slaves, the so-called "free laborers," poor farmers and, in some cases, small shop
						keepers and petty tradesmen who felt the heavy burden of taxation imposed by grafting
						colonial governors and their fellow pilferers. Where masses of these rebelled they
						always lacked any definite plan of action. They were blind uprisings striking against
						economic, political and social rulers and the latter, possessing the coercive powers of
						government, were able to suppress them.</p>
					<p>The intolerable conditions of the blacks provoked at least twenty-five rebellions of
						these slaves in the United States before the American Revolution. The fear of these
						slave insurrections gave rise to the atrocious slave codes of the southern states.
						Rebellions on the slave ships were put down by applying the thumb-screws, chaining
						slaves together, or shooting down the leaders and casting the dead into the sea. To
						reduce the danger of revolts slaves were generally prohibited from meeting together
						without a white man being present or to leave the plantation without a permit. A free
						man could lash disobedient slaves and could kill them if they struck in self-defense. To
						take the <pb id="VAC1311-062" n="62"/> life of a slave was no crime. Some offenses were
						punished by cropping the ears or branding the cheek; cutting off the right hand,
						severing the head from the trunk, dismembering the body and hanging the pieces up to
						public view.<ref id="ref_116" target="note_116" rend="super">1</ref> One rebellious
						slave in the Bermudas had his right hand chopped off at the wrist and the bleeding stump
						thrust into boiling pitch. After suffering excruciating agony he was immersed and burned
						to death.</p>
					<p>During Governor Hunter's administration of New York in 1712, a party of negroes, armed
						with guns, knives and hatchets, fired a building and shot and slashed those who ran to
						the spot. Soldiers captured the slaves and twenty-one were executed. "One was broken on
						the wheel, and several were burned alive at the stake, while the rest were hanged."<ref
							id="ref_117" target="note_117" rend="super">2</ref> In 1774 a revolt in Georgia was
						suppressed and two leaders burned at the stake after having murdered four and injured as
						many more. About one thousand blacks revolted in Virginia in 1800 and marched on the
						city of Richmond. A swollen stream interfered with their march; the leaders were
						captured and executed. The rebellion under the leadership of Nat Turner in the same
						state, in 1831, terrorized the haughty planters. Local militia co-operating with United
						States troops crushed the uprising after the blacks had killed sixty white people.
						Twelve of them were sold out of the state and twenty, including Turner were hanged.</p>
					<p>In 1792 the slave insurrection under Toussaint L' Ouverture took place in St. Domingo.
						As this rebellion was the most notable one of the blacks and had considerable influence
						on the agitation against slavery, we will notice it here. The island had a population of
						30,000 whites, 30,000 mulattoes and 500,000 slaves. Sugar culture killed the slaves off
						so rapidly that 25,000 negroes were imported annually. The mulattoes were children of
						the slave owners and their fathers, as a rule, did not forget them because their mothers
						were slaves. The mulattoes <note id="note_116"><ref target="ref_116" rend="super"

					<p>St. Domingo was a colony of France. When the Revolution broke in that country and the

					<p>In Virginia a rebellion of poor whites took place in 1676 that startled the planter
						aristocracy. Roughly speaking, there were four classes in the colony; the great planters
						below tide water on the main rivers who lived in luxury and possessed the governing
						power; the middle class of small planters and farmers who aped the manners of the ruling
						class; the poor whites and indentured slaves, and the blacks. The frontier was peopled
						by the poorer classes of farmers and frequent Indian raids had destroyed crops and many
						families were massacred. Appeals for protection repeatedly made to Governor Berkeley,
						one of the many colonial grafters of that time, met with little encouragement. <hi
							rend="i">Berkeley was interested in the fur trade with the Indians who were making war
							on the settlers and to recruit sufficient militia to protect the latter would have
							meant a loss of his profits in the traffic.</hi> The governor had also failed to
						convene the House of Burgesses (legislative assembly) for years and in 1670 increased
						property qualifications for the franchise increased discontent among the poorer classes.
						All these factors contributed to what has come to be known as "Bacon's Rebellion."</p>
					<p>Nathaniel Bacon was a young man of 28 and a descendant of the great Lord Bacon. He was
						a land owner, a member of the council, a pursuasive speaker and sympathetic with the
						struggles of the poor. His land was in the zone of the warring Indians and he asked for
						a commission against them. Receiving an evasive answer from the governor he took the
						field at the head of the distressed settlers. Having defeated the Indians he was
						arrested on his return to Jamestown, but after giving promise of good behavior was
						released.</p>
					<p>In the elections to the House of Burgesses which shortly followed, many ignored the new
						property qualifications and voted. Bacon was elected a member by a large majority. Under
						his leadership the house restored the old basis for the suffrage, some trade monopolies
						were overthrown and two magistrates disfranchised for misconduct in office. All these
						popular measures were enacted over the opposition of the aristocratic members of the
						house <pb id="VAC1311-065" n="65"/> and Bacon was cordially hated by Berkeley and the
						aristocracy. Fearing that his life was in danger the rebel left Jamestown, but returned
						in a few days.</p>
					<p>He then charged the governor with having imposed unjust taxes "for the advancement of
						private favorites and other sinister ends," for "having rendered contemptible the
						majesty of justice, of advancing . . . scandalous and ignorant favorites," for having
						assumed "the monopoly of the beaver trade," and failure to "give protection against the
						assaults of the Indians." He also denounced the aristocracy, the "juggling parasites
						whose tottering fortunes have been repaired at the public charge." These charges
						committed Bacon to open revolt against the governor and the ruling class.</p>
					<p>He again entered the field against the Indians and on the return march the rebels
						burned Jamestown. But his radical utterances and general policy frightened some of his
						well-to-do followers who deserted him&mdash;a treachery for which the middle class is
						noted in all countries and at all times. The poorer classes were left to form the ranks
						of his small force and the struggle assumed the character of a class war with all the
						elements of the aristocracy arrayed against the rebels. Shortly after the burning of
						Jamestown, while marching north, Bacon fell a victim of malaria fever. His death brought
						the collapse of the rebellion, though small groups held out for some time. Berkeley
						punished the rebels with such ferocity as to call forth the protest of the king who
						said, <hi rend="i">"the old fool has put to death more people in that naked country than
							I did here for the murder of my father"</hi><ref id="ref_119" target="note_119"
							rend="super">4</ref></p>
					<p>It was the leading families who had large estates and made up the wealthy aristocracy
						of Virginia that supported the grafting governor in the rebellion. This class had
						gradually usurped powers in the government and restricted the privileges of the poorer
						classes. A great section of the population was also in the direst poverty so that the
						economic and political conditions favoring revolt <note id="note_119"><ref
								target="ref_119" rend="super">4</ref> Fiske, "Old Virginia and Her Neighbors," Vol.
							II, p. 95. See also Thwaites, "The Colonies," pp. 78-79.</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-066" n="66"/> were abundant. William Sherwood, who later became attorney
						general of Virginia, referred to the rebels as "ye scum of the country." A member of the
						council says that Bacon "gathers about him <hi rend="i">a Rabble of the basest sort of
							people, whose Condicion was such, as by a change could not admitt of worse,</hi> . . .
						who for ye ease of the poore will have noe taxes paied, . . . but would have all
						magistracie &amp; Governm'nt taken away &amp; Sett up one themselves, &amp; to make
						their Good Intentions more manifest <hi rend="i">stick not to talk openly of sharing
							men's estates among themselves."</hi></p>
					<p>This testimony comes from the aristocrats, and indicates that they regarded the
						rebellion as a revolt of the poorer classes to secure equality of political rights and
						economic opportunities. The rebels are even charged with having communistic
						aspirations&mdash;with the desire "of sharing men's estates" in common. It is probable
						that Bacon may have had a communistic program in mind. It would have served to unite the
						poor against the landed aristocracy. They also knew that early in the history of
						Virginia the planting of corn, clearing the wilderness, fortifying the settlement and
						work in general was performed, for a time, on a communistic basis. The charge against
						Bacon then was that he promised a return to this early stage in the history of the
						colony.</p>
					<p>Bacon was driven to this radicalism in order to hold the loyalty of the poor after the
						desertion of the better-situated elements and also because of the knowledge that should
						he fail he would probably be hanged or shot. The causes of the revolt are well
						summarized by the historian Fiske.</p>
					<p>"The years preceding the rebellion," he writes, "were such as are commonly called 'hard
						times.' People felt poor and saw fortunes made by corrupt officials; the fault was with
						the Navigation Act and with the debauched civil service of Charles II and Berkeley.
						Besides these troubles, which were common to all, the poorer people felt oppressed by
						taxation in regard to which they were not consulted and for which they seemed to get no
						service in return. <pb id="VAC1311-067" n="67"/> The distribution of taxation by polls,
						equal amounts for rich and poor, was resented as a cruel injustice. The subject of
						taxation was clearly connected with the Indian troubles, for people paid large sums for
						military defense and nevertheless saw their houses burned and their families
							massacred."<ref id="ref_120" target="note_120" rend="super">5</ref> We have seen in a
						previous chapter that lack of protection for the frontier was generally the policy of
						the colonial rulers, and Bacon's Rebellion is a noted example of the discontent this
						policy provoked. Had Bacon proved successful he would have become noted as a pioneer in
						the struggle for popular rule.</p>
					<p>The next revolt of importance was that of Leisler's Rebellion in New York twelve years
						later. As already noted<ref id="ref_121" target="note_121" rend="super">6</ref> New York
						was the nearest approach to the establishment of feudalism in America. The sweeping
						powers and privileges given the manor lords created discontent from the beginning of
						colonization. Their descendants claimed feudal rights well into the nineteenth century
						and on the great Van Rensselaer estate an attempt to collect long arrears of rents
						developed an anti-rent movement (1839-1846) which resulted in bloody riots.<ref
							id="ref_122" target="note_122" rend="super">7</ref></p>
					<p>Coupled with the existence of an overbearing, wealthy, ruling class, was the usual
						administration of grafting governors. Fletcher, we have seen, had a close alliance with
						the pirates and shared in their loot. The pirates were underselling the regular
						merchants which added this class to the mass of the discontented. This pirate commerce
						was enormous and for a time New York resembled an oriental city. "For a dozen years or
						more the streets of New York might have reminded one of Teheran or Bassora, with their
						shops displaying rugs of Anatolia or Daghestan, tables of carved teak-wood, vases of
						hammered brass or silver, Bagdad portiers, fans of ivory or sandalwood, soft shawls of
						myriad gorgeous hues and white crape."<ref id="ref_123" target="note_123" rend="super"

					<p>The landed aristocracy shared some of their power with rich fur traders, lawyers and

						artisans and indentured slaves who were viewed with contempt by the aristocracy.</p>
					<p>Jacob Leisler, who gave his name to the rebellion, was a German of humble origin, born
						at Frankfort-on-the-Main. He had married a daughter of a rich family, but was not
						accepted on terms of equality with the ruling class. He was lacking in the education and
						polish that distinguished the wealthy idlers. His sympathy with the poor was expressed
						in deeds. In 1689 he bought a piece of land for Huguenots and at another time when a
						poor Huguenot family were to be sold as redemptioners, he delivered them from servitude
						by paying their passage money.<ref id="ref_124" target="note_124" rend="super">9</ref>
						He was admired by the poor for his honesty and unselfishness, which made him the logical
						leader of the discontent that had been long gathering in the city.</p>
					<p>King James II had consolidated New England, New York and New Jersey under Governor
						Andros. The latter went to New England leaving Francis Nicholson as lieutenant governor
						when news came of the flight of King James and the landing of William of Orange in
						England. Nicholson withheld the news and Leisler, hearing of the event, made it public.
						The latter also refused to pay duty on a cargo of wine on the ground that the collector
						was a Catholic and since King James' flight no legal government existed in New York.
						There was also the popular belief that Governor Nicholson had gone over to Louis XIV and
						an invasion by a French fleet was feared.</p>
					<p>An insolent remark of the governor released the pent up forces of revolt. A militia
						company representing the popular party, seized the fort and Leisler, after repeated
						solicitations, took command. A committee of public safety, elected by popular vote,
						turned the aristocratic government out and proclaimed Jacob Leisler commander in chief
						of the fort and city. At another election the aristocracy was completely routed and
						Leisler was proclaimed supreme commander of the province. The defeated masters
						endeavored to stir up discord. "The name of Leisler was <note id="note_124"><ref
								target="ref_124" rend="super">9</ref> Faust, "The German Element in the United
							States," Vol. I, p. 14.</note>

						usurper, demagogue, even as a Papist and Jacobite, by the very persons who had proved
						their disloyalty to the new dynasty."<ref id="ref_125" target="note_125" rend="super"
							>10</ref></p>
					<p>The aristocrats tried to kidnap the popular commander, but failed and three of them
						were themselves imprisoned. Leisler held power for several years during which the first
						American congress of the colonies met in New York at his call in May, 1690. But his rule
						was not to endure long. Discontent over taxes, the refusal of William to recognize his
						agent, the timidity and lack of concerted plans of his followers, the plotting and
						bitter antagonism of his enemies, contributed to his overthrow. The arrival of Governor
						Sloughter was followed by the seizure of Leisler and his son-in-law, Milborne. <hi
							rend="i">"A sham trial was instituted, in which Sloughter appointed Leisler's personal
							enemies as his judges."</hi><ref id="ref_126" target="note_126" rend="super">11</ref>
						The councilors arrested with him were released; Leisler was charged with rebellion,
						confiscation of property, and the illegal levying of taxes. He and Milborne refused to
						defend themselves against the charges and both were sentenced to death. Both were hanged
						May 16, 1691, near the present site of the World building in Park Row.</p>
					<p>Sloughter was reluctant to sign the death warrant and tradition has it that at a
						wedding feast of one of the aristocrats, the governor was induced to sign the paper
						while drunk. Leisler made a pathetic speech just before the bandage was applied to his
						eyes and thus died one of the early popular revolts against class rule in America.</p>
					<p>A later governor, Lord Bellomont, a man of democratic tastes, who detested the landed
						parasites, <hi rend="i">declared the execution of Leisler and Milborne was a judicial
							murder</hi> and their estates were restored to their heirs. Though the leaders of the

					<p>The records regarding revolts of indentured whites are scanty, but that they took place
						is certain. The white bondman, like the black slave, frequently acting under the spur of
						brutal treatment, would murder his master. One redemptioner who was hung in chains in
						Virginia, in August, 1678, for murdering his owner, mistress and her maid, has left a

					<p>Bernard Romans' "Concise Natural History of East and West Florida" (New York, 1776),
						records a rebellion of white slaves about 35 miles south of St. Augustine, on St. John's

					<p>"About 1,500 people, men, women and children," he writes, "were deluded away from their

					<p>"O Florida! were this the only instance of similar barbarity which thou hast seen, we

						usage, and that at a period of life when health and strength generally maintain the
						human frame in its greatest vigor, and seem to insure longevity. Rolles Town in
						particular has been the sepulchre of above four hundred such victims."</p>
					<p>He then relates the story of an insurrection of these slaves "which the great ones
						stile rebellion." The poor wretches driven to despair in 1769, by these intolerable
						conditions, entered some provision stores and seized some boats lying in the harbor.
						Like the other revolts we have reviewed, the rebels acted without any careful planning
						and the leadership fell to an Italian whose reputation was not of the best. While hiding
						in the harbor a regiment of troops arrived to whom they surrendered, with the exception
						of one boat which escaped to the Florida Keys. Romans, the historian of the affair, was
						one of the grand jury to investigate the rebellion and states "we only found five
						bills." One was found against a rebel who had maimed one Cutter, "who had been made a
						justice of the peace, with no other view than to enable him to execute his barbarities
						to a larger extent." Here, as in Pennsylvania, we find "grafters in high places"

					<p>The jury room was crowded with masters whose scowls indicated the sentences they

						are informed that it "disappointed the expectations of more than one great man. Governor
						Grant pardoned two, <hi rend="i">and a third who was obliged to be the executioner of
							the remaining two."</hi> We feel some elation to be informed that the grafting justice
						of the peace "some time after died a lingering death, having experienced, besides his
						wounds, the terrors of a coward in power, overtaken by vengeance."<ref id="ref_129"

					<p>These revolts are generally stigmatized as "rebellions" in the popular histories and
						are usually damned as unreasoning acts prompted by demagogues and agitators. However,
						they redound to the glory of the workers for a contented, unresisting, servile class is
						the most melancholy aspect of any age ruled by a privileged class. We shall not quarrel
						over words. Whether these uprisings were rebellions, insurrections, strikes, revolts or
						civil wars, matters little. That they incarnated the spirit of rebellion against the
						colonial slavers and rulers is of interest to us. The subject classes that are capable
						of turning on those who profit by their subjection&mdash;and do turn&mdash;are worthy of
						our admiration and esteem. <hi rend="i">It is this spirit of revolt among the poor, not
							the intrigues and "statesmanship" of the "great men" of the past, that we regard as
							glorious in American history.</hi></p>
					<p>We shall see in another chapter how one rebellion drove the ruling classes to

					<head rend="center b">General Status of the Workers</head>
					<p>In reviewing the general economic and social conditions of the workers we are aware
						that it would be a false judgment to base our estimate on twentieth century standards.
						The degree of material comfort possible before the age of machinery was necessarily less
						than now. The capacity for producing wealth was small owing to the crude forms of
						production that prevailed. Yet with this reservation only one with a bias favoring
						aristocracy can give the appreciative view of the past that is usually found in the
						school books and histories. It is no exaggeration to say that the society of colonial
						times, and long after the Revolution, regarded labor as a badge of shame. It was because
						of this view held by the wealthy classes that all the colonies, and later the states,
						withheld the franchise from those not possessing a certain amount of property. The
						possession of property was a passport to the "best society" and enabled the holder to
						share in political and other privileges. If a poor farmer or laborer by some stroke of
						good fortune came into possession of wealth, it removed the social and economic curse
						under which he previously lived.</p>
					<p>Massachusetts, in 1691, restricted the franchise to possessors of an estate of freehold
						in land or other estate to the value of 40 pounds per annum. A Maryland law (1681)
						limited the suffrage to those having freeholds of fifty acres or other property worth 40
						pounds. In New Jersey (1688) it was 200 acres of land or 50 pounds. New York (1665)
						provided for town meetings and election of a constable and eight overseers by a
						"plurality of the voices of the freeholders." In 1680 an assembly was formed composed of
						eighteen deputies elected by freeholders. In Connecticut (1639) the governor and six
						magistrates were to be elected by a majority of the freemen. In Virginia the suffrage
						had been restricted to freemen, but in 1670 it <pb id="VAC1311-074" n="74"/> was further
						restricted to "such as by their estates, real or personall, have interest enough to tye
						them to the endeavor of the publique good."<ref id="ref_130" target="note_130"
							rend="super">1</ref> This law was one of the causes contributing to Bacon's
						Rebellion.</p>
					<p>In South Carolina (1765) members of the assembly must own 500 acres of land and ten
						slaves or possess 1,000 pounds in land, houses and other property. In Georgia delegates
						to the assembly are required to own 500 acres of land and suffrage was restricted to
						those who owned 50 acres or a town lot. In North Carolina one must own land to hold
						office, and only freeholders could vote. "This system was ingrafted on the constitution
						adopted when North Carolina became a state, and by which senators were obliged to own
						300 acres of land, and representatives 100, while the suffrage was restricted to
						freeholders of 50 acres."<ref id="ref_131" target="note_131" rend="super">2</ref></p>
					<p>The Declaration of Independence and the triumph of the Revolution brought few changes
						in the property qualifications for the franchise. Nearly all the state constitutions
						adopted at this time repeated the assertion of the Declaration that "all men are created
						equal," but "an examination of these state constitutions reveals the fact that in their
						formation very little regard was paid to the self-evident truths, and that <hi rend="i"
							>the very men who were loudly asserting the political equality of man went on and set
							up governments under which political equality had no existence."</hi><ref id="ref_132"
							target="note_132" rend="super">3</ref> The suffrage laws in the states after the
						Revolution confirm this judgment. Massachusetts required the voter to have an income of
						three pounds a year from a freehold estate or personal estate worth sixty pounds. In
						Connecticut he must have a similar income of seven dollars or real estate worth $134. In
						New Jersey his real estate must be worth fifty pounds and Maryland the same, or personal
						property of thirty pounds. In Virginia he must own "twenty-five acres of land, properly
						planted, with a house thereon at least twelve feet square on the foundation," <note

						Carolina he must be a free white man owning fifty acres or a town lot.</p>
					<p>To hold office the property qualifications were still higher, ranging from 100 pounds
						to 500, or land or slaves, and generally including a belief in the Christian religion.
						Everywhere the basis of office holding and the suffrage was property. "It was indeed
						true that all governments derived their just powers from the consent of the governed;
						yet under these early state constitutions, none but tax-paying, property-owning men
						could give that consent from which government derives its just powers. . . . <hi
							rend="i">The poor man counted for nothing.</hi> He was governed, but not with his
						consent, by his property-owning Christian neighbors. . . . In short, the broad doctrine
						that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, was not
						accepted by the 'Fathers.'"<ref id="ref_133" target="note_133" rend="super">4</ref></p>
					<p>Exclusion of masses of workingmen from the ballot continued till the middle of the
						nineteenth century and in 1842 it caused an armed uprising in Rhode Island, known as
						"Dorr's Rebellion." This revolt temporarily seated Thomas Dorr in the governor's chair,
						but he was finally ousted, the rebellion put down with troops, and a price was placed on
						the head of the fugitive governor. <hi rend="i">He was captured and sentenced to prison
							for life for the "crime" of endeavoring to establish popular rule.</hi> In 1845 a
						"liberation" governor was elected, Dorr was set free, and the clerk of the supreme court
						was ordered to write across the record of his sentence the words "REVERSED AND ANNULLED
						BY ORDER OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY."<ref id="ref_134" target="note_134" rend="super"

					<p>A study of the official declarations of the dominant political parties down to this
						time <hi rend="i">reveals the fact that all of them were silent regarding this policy of

						offense should have their tongues pierced with red-hot irons. The following year the

					<p>Even in the church the workers were made to understand their servile status. The

						the tithing man collected fees, the constable arrested the ungodly if they remained away
						and reported them if they were merry. In short, it was a time when it was impious to be
						happy and a virtue to be morose.</p>
					<p>Perhaps the debtors' prison was the most atrocious institution provided for the
						unfortunate of colonial times, and this, like restricted suffrage and indentured
						service, survived well into the first half of the nineteenth century. The administration
						of these prisons and the treatment accorded workingmen reads like a chapter from
						Stepniak's "Russia Under the Czars." In fact, one gets the impression that the Russian

						up a total of $14.54, for which he was held responsible. In Boston&mdash;"the cradle of

					<head rend="center b">Causes of the American Revolution</head>

					<p>Our survey of historical conditions in the colonies gives us a fairly accurate idea of
						the society out of which came the movement that resulted in breaking the ties of
						dependence on Great Britain. If our account is a correct one, we can only retain the
						general belief that the American Revolution was a popular uprising of the whole people
						by assuming that there was a sudden change of heart on the part of the great planters,
						the traders in black and white slaves, and other sections of the aristocracy. But this
						assumption is shattered by the facts which our investigation has revealed; namely, that
						the political disfranchisement of the workers, the auction of indentured whites and the
						traffic in them, the horrors of the debtors' prisons, and conspiracy laws against
						organizations of labor, <hi rend="i">survived long after the Revolution was fought and
							won.</hi></p>
					<p>This consideration also disposes of the historical traditions that are taught children
						in the schools and suggests that another explanation must be found for the causes of the
						American Revolution. Fortunately, evidence exists in abundance to show that <hi rend="i"
							>it was a revolt of the aristocracy fought by the workers under the delusion that the
							grandiloquent phrases of the Declaration of Independence implied greater opportunities
							and liberties for the long-suffering laborers.</hi> This war, like most wars in
						history, was "a rich man's war and a poor man's fight." Ruling classes always represent
						a minority of society and they never, as a whole, risk their lives on the battlefield.
						Unless they can get their slaves to fight for them, wars are impossible. The workers
						have, thus far, fought the battles of every class but their own. To induce them to do so
						it is necessary to disguise the real issue under glittering phrases like those of the
						Declaration which asserts that "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by
						their Creator with certain <pb id="VAC1311-086" n="86"/> inalienable rights," etc. Such
						statements are calculated to stir the blood of men who are regarded by their masters as
						unequal and who are deprived of the rights declared to be inalienable.</p>
					<p>But the civilization of that day was such a shameless and naked system of class
						domination that the Revolution, as we shall see, was far from being a popular or
						unanimous uprising, and so suspicious were the workers of the real designs of the
						leaders that, with all the pleadings of the latter, great difficulty was encountered in
						getting enough enlistments in the Continental army to present a fighting force to the
						British invaders. Many who did enlist did so only after promises of certain rewards. But
						even promised rewards did not prevent constant desertions which provoked the despair of
						Washington revealed by him in his correspondence with congress and with personal
						friends.</p>
					<p>The causes of the Revolution may be traced to the attitude of the ruling classes of
						Great Britain toward the colonies. From the time of the discovery of America these
						classes regarded the New World as a place of investment. As early as 1651 a navigation
						act was passed forbidding importation of goods into England except in English ships, or
						ships of the colony exporting the goods, and another act provided that no goods should
						be shipped to countries other than England and her colonies. This aroused the resentment
						of the trading classes of the colonies and gave a strong impulse to smuggling which
						later became a profitable calling for many of these traders.</p>
					<p>More drastic laws were passed one hundred years later. In 1750 Parliament passed acts
						prohibiting the erection of any mill or engine for slitting or rolling iron, or any
						plating forge or any steel furnace. Hatters were not allowed to take more than two
						apprentices at a time or any for more than seven years. It was made illegal to
						manufacture hats or woolens in one colony and sell in another. These laws were generally
						violated by resorting to smuggling.</p>
					<p>In 1764 further laws were enacted restricting <pb id="VAC1311-087" n="87"/> commerce
						and manufacture. The imposition of duties aroused the ire of the commercial class, but
						the method of punishing violation of the acts increased discontent. The smuggler was
						tried in the courts of admiralty and deprived of trial by jury. The judge, who was a
						creature of the crown, was paid out of the fines which he himself assessed and so had
						every reason to convict upon the slightest evidence. The wealthy smugglers were thus the
						victims of a repressive policy, the spirit of which they rigidly observed in their
						treatment of the poor classes. It may be said, too, that the British government was
						forced to abolish trial by jury and substitute admiralty courts <hi rend="i">because the
							wealthy smugglers exercised such power, influence and terrorism that few juries dared
							to convict them.</hi></p>
					<p>In spite of the growing discontent of the influential classes, the British government
						continued its policy. Navigation laws closed colonial ports against foreign vessels and
						allowed them to only export to other British colonies. Duties were also levied on trade
						between the colonies. <hi rend="i">The British capitalists, sweating fortunes out of
							their working class victims, wanted no competitors in the colonies to challenge their
							commerce on the seas. American employers and traders wanted the unrestricted
							opportunities to exploit their workers which British capitalists were enjoying.</hi>
						It was a quarrel between two ruling classes divided by a vast expanse of water, and each
						envying the opportunities of the other. Commerce, ship building, industry and
						agriculture had developed to such an extent at the dawn of the Revolution that these
						acts of Parliament became a serious menace to the incomes of the colonial masters.</p>
					<p>Smuggling was developed to a fine art. A pamphlet written in 1774 asserts that nearly
						all merchants were smugglers and perjurers and "that such a system was ruining the
						morals of the country."<ref id="ref_149" target="note_149" rend="super">1</ref> In fact,
						smuggling became so popular with merchants and shippers that they lost all sense of
						gratitude toward Great Britain when France was endeavoring to annex the colonies to
						Canada&mdash; <note id="note_149"><ref target="ref_149" rend="super">1</ref> Fisher,
							"True History of the Revolution," p. 42.</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-088" n="88"/> an event which the colonial aristocracy dreaded. While
						Great Britain was spending large sums in defending the colonies against French
						aggression, "it was found that the French fleets, the French garrisons, and the French
						West India islands, were systematically supplied with large quantities of provisions by
						the New England colonies. . . . The smuggling was even defended with a wonderful
						cynicism on the ground that it was good policy to make as much money as possible out of
						the enemy."<ref id="ref_150" target="note_150" rend="super">2</ref> The enormous extent
						of this illicit trade with the enemy is shown by the fact that the total revenue
						collected in the colonial custom houses amounted to between 1,000 and 2,000 pounds a
						year, and the cost of collecting this revenue was between 7,000 and 8,000 pounds.<ref
							id="ref_151" target="note_151" rend="super">3</ref> To add to this ingratitude, the
						French were no sooner expelled from Canada till the smuggling traders openly joined in
						the chorus for separation from their protector.</p>
					<p>Buckle's judgment of the vices of smuggling and the general tendency of this traffic,
						though directed against the European type, applies to these revolutionary "patriots." He
						says "they contaminated the surrounding population; introduced into peaceful villages

					<p>The Boston Tea Party which has inspired so much patriotic oratory can be traced to the
						practice of smuggling. The tax on tea made it very profitable for smugglers to deal in
						this commodity. The trade in tea was largely in the hands of the East India company, a
						chartered corporation of Great Britain. John Hancock and other tea merchants had
						smuggled large quantities of tea into Boston and were doing a large business. In the

						that the collapse of the company would bring on a panic in England. There were
						17,000,000 pounds of the East India company's tea in British warehouses for which there
						was no demand, because of the large quantities smuggled into the colonies from Holland.
						Parliament decided to repeal the tax on tea and the New England smugglers became panic
						stricken. But the masses of the people "were pleased at the prospect of drinking tea at
						less expense than ever." The repeal of the tax meant that the East India company would
						be able to sell tea at much smaller prices than Hancock and his fellow smugglers could.

					<p>Smuggling, of course, was not confined to tea alone, for in all forms of trade it
						"proved a sure road to wealth. In every town prominent characters could be pointed out,
						who, when the states were under British rule, had constantly stowed away in their
						cellars and attics goods they would have been loath to have the officers of the customs

						writes McMaster, "the greater infamy of supplying slaves must be shared by England and
						the North. While the states were yet colonies, to buy negroes and sell them into slavery
						had become a source of profit to the inhabitants of many New England towns. . . .
						Molasses brought from Jamaica was turned to rum; the rum dispatched to Africa bought

						exercised considerable influence in forming opinion favorable to independence.</p>
					<p>In October, 1774, the Continental Congress, seeming to appreciate the contradiction in
						their professions respecting liberty and the traffic in slaves and wishing to appear
						well before the world, passed an act declaring "We will neither import, nor purchase any
						slave imported after the first day of December next." But it is notorious that the
						slavers continued their business and it was thirteen years later before Massachusetts
						passed an act prohibiting it.<ref id="ref_160" target="note_160" rend="super">12</ref>
						In the same year Rhode Island passed an act prohibiting importation of slaves. The
						preamble stated that the inhabitants would be inconsistent to hold slaves while fighting

						shall extend, or be deemed to extend," to the slave trade.<ref id="ref_161"

						of a distant people who never offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery
						in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither." The

					<p>The southern planters, though slower to endorse separation, also joined for motives no
						more creditable than those actuating the northern traffickers in slaves and their
						colleagues, the merchant smugglers. Many of these planters were in debt to British
						merchants and saw in the Revolution an opportunity to repudiate their debts. A manifesto
						was issued in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1774, which stated that "The planters are
						greatly in arrears to the merchants; a stoppage of importation (of slaves) would give
						them all an opportunity to extricate themselves from debt."<ref id="ref_163"

					<p>Wendell Phillips in a speech delivered in Boston, 1861, summed up the motives of both
						planter and merchant in demanding independence. With all of his admiration for the
						revolutionary leaders he was conscious of the material interests that prompted the
						activity of the two classes mentioned. He declared: "It is not always . . . ideas or
						moral principles that push the world forward. Selfish interests play a large part in the
						work. Our Revolution of 1776 succeeded because trade and wealth joined hands with
						principle and enthusiasm&mdash;a union rare in the history of revolutions. <hi rend="i"

					<p>The home government also endeavored to restrict settlement along the coast as the

						to prosecution as a law breaker.<ref id="ref_165" target="note_165" rend="super"
							>17</ref> These speculators reaped their harvest of wealth when the new government was

					<p>The great mass of laborers, artisans and small farmers were indifferent to the
						agitation for liberty and independence. The redemptioner was a bond slave and knew that
						it made no difference whether he was a subject of the British crown or of the home
						exploiters. The "free" laborer did not enthuse, for the laws that fixed his status as an
						underling and providing imprisonment for debt were being enforced by the very "patriots"
						who were talking so glibly about independence. The slaves, of course, were dumb, unable
						to speak for themselves and nothing in the Revolution held out any promise of release
						for them. The small farmers, too, were on the whole indifferent, for taxes fell heavily
						on their shoulders and the high prices of living and excessive rates of interest made
						them suspicious of the coast merchants and money lenders. The lot of the toilers of
						every class was not to be envied, and though having little chance to secure an
						education, their experience with the wealthy classes taught them to beware when the
						masters came bearing gifts.</p>
					<p>Yet it was necessary to draw fighters for the Revolution from the ranks of the
						subjected population if a struggle was to be waged at all. This was not an easy task,
						but it was accomplished nevertheless. Those who have today seen poor wretches half
						clothed, unemployed, liable to eviction for non-payment of rent and dodging the

						does not mention a single distinct working class grievance, by its eloquent phrases
						deluded large numbers of the poor classes into the belief that a new era was dawning for
						them. But this was not a unanimous sentiment by any means&mdash;either of the poor or
						even the wealthy classes. John Adams wrote that "New York and Pennsylvania were so
						nearly divided, if their propensity was not against us, that if New England on one side
						and Virginia on the other had not kept them in awe, they would have joined the British."

					<p>In fact, the Revolution was the work of an aggressive minority "who succeeded in

					<p>The wide extent and character of the violence employed by Samuel Adams and other rebels
						is instructive. "Men were ridden and tossed on fence rails; were gagged and bound for
						days at a time; pelted with stones; fastened in rooms where there was a fire with the
						chimney stopped on top; advertised as public enemies, so that they would be cut off from

						opposition in the memorable Hutchinson Riot in Boston, August 26, 1765. Josiah Quincy,
						Jr., writes of the mob besieging Hutchinson's house, the latter barely escaping serious
						injury or death. The rioters gutted the house and destroyed nearly everything of value,
						including some records and rare documents of great value to historians. These were

					<p>One other consideration we have to offer as among the contributing causes of the
						Revolution. The acts restricting commerce and manufactures were aimed, as we have seen,
						by the British ruling class against the colonial ruling class. This was sufficient to
						arouse the resentment of the latter and drive most of them to revolt. But our colonial
						manufacturers were also aware of the great advantages which their British brethren
						possessed in the new machinery that Arkwright and others were inventing across the sea.
						Machines for carding and spinning were fast displacing the old hand processes in making
						cloth. The small skill required to operate these machines enabled the British factory
						lords to sweat large numbers of women and children. To guard this advantage the British
						Parliament passed acts prohibiting the exportation of machines, plans, or models of
						machines or any tools used in cotton or linen manufacture, under penalty of 200 pounds.
						Even the possession of them for export rendered the offender liable to arrest. Watt was
						also making his first improvements on Newcomen's engine.</p>
					<p>These inventions brought with them the crucifixion of men, women and children of the
						working class. Children from seven to twelve and fourteen years of age were worked
						fourteen and sixteen hours per day under brutal taskmasters. Women frequently fainted at
						machines or gave birth to children on factory floors. The workhouses and almshouses of
						London and Birmingham and other <note id="note_175"><ref target="ref_175" rend="super"

						<pb id="VAC1311-099" n="99"/> cities were raided for children, idiots being taken with
						the rest. The factories became torture chambers and in some cases places of murder, with
						the child slaves as victims.</p>
					<p>Every ship and every mail that came to America brought news of these events and
						stimulated the desire to apply the new processes here. But British acts stood in the way
						and we have already noted the efforts of the colonial masters to make child labor
						profitable. Although the colonial appetite for child labor was whetted by the industrial
						changes in England it was not till 1789 that the new machinery was secured. In that year
						Samuel Slater, "The Father of American Manufactures," established the first cotton mill
						in this country, in Rhode Island, <hi rend="i">and all of his employes were children

						one of the "inalienable rights of man." Furthermore, the second act of the first United

						levying a protective tariff,<ref id="ref_177" target="note_177" rend="super">29</ref>

						slavers, the land speculators, the southern planters, the money lenders, and a host of
						adventurers with itching palms were interested in fomenting the agitation for
						independence. When the Declaration of Independence passes from eloquent phrases to an
						enumeration of grievances these are seen to be ills that affected some one of these

					<p>"It is not too much to say," writes the historian, Fiske, "that the period of five
						years following the peace of 1783 was the most critical moment in all the history of the
						American people."<ref id="ref_179" target="note_179" rend="super">1</ref> It was a
						critical period&mdash;for the smugglers, speculators, slavers and others of the
						privileged classes, for it seemed to these that the great landed empire, tremendous
						resources and power which the Revolution gave them all hung in the balance and with
						strong possibility that the insurgent poor would secure these advantages for themselves.
						The workers by their heroism and sacrifices at Bunker Hill and Yorktown; by their
						sufferings during the terrible winter at Valley Forge had won the Revolution and were
						certainly entitled to the fruits of victory or, at least, deserved exceptional
						consideration.</p>
					<p>But the last shot had scarcely been fired till these veterans, retracing their weary
						steps homeward, were confronted with a terrible situation. It is doubtful whether
						history affords another such example of the shameless ingratitude and contemptible greed
						displayed by a ruling class toward its benefactors, that the "Fathers" displayed toward
						the poor veterans of the war. The farmers and laborers found that while they were at the
						front risking their lives in the struggle, <hi rend="i">the wealthy classes were
							confiscating their little farms and household goods for debts contracted during the
							war and imprisoning thousands for debt.</hi> The rebellion which this process of
						confiscation provoked constitutes the "critical period" referred to by Fiske. With this
						historian, as with most others, the poor rebels are <note id="note_179"><ref

							History," p. 55.</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-102" n="102"/> viewed as a senseless mob of fanatics for not submitting
						quietly to the wholesale confiscation without protest.</p>
					<p>The war, like all wars, left the country devasted and impoverished and the distress was
						frightful in all the states. In Vermont "One-half the community was totally bankrupt;
						the other half was plunged in the depths of poverty. The year which had elapsed since
						the affair at Yorktown had not brought all the blessings that had been foretold."<ref
							id="ref_180" target="note_180" rend="super">2</ref> A large part of the country had
						been laid waste; commerce was all but suspended and Great Britain still maintained the
						policy of commercial antagonism toward her late colonies. "What wealth there was lay in
						the hands of a few score men. The disparity of condition between a laborer and a Charles
						Carroll or a George Washington was probably greater than exists today between a laborer
						and a Carnegie. Employment was scarce; the circulating medium fluctuated in value; the
						workman had no security for his pay, and was frequently defrauded. Wages were paid
						quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. If the workman bought goods on credit, the
						debtors' prison yawned for him; and, if he was imprisoned, his food and comforts had to
						be supplied by private charity."<ref id="ref_181" target="note_181" rend="super"

					<p>Thousands were scarcely able to keep clothes on their backs or to provide their
						families with the most common necessities. The money was in the hands of the rich and
						high rates of interest made it impossible for the leather-breeched mechanic or the
						debt-ridden farmer to borrow. The sheriffs were selling the poor farmers' property for
						debts and they endeavored to evade the seizures by hiding furniture or other goods,
						driving cattle to a neighbor's pasture, or making houses and small farms over to
						relatives. The debtors' prisons were glutted with victims. In New Hampshire "It was then
						the fashion, . . . as indeed it was everywhere, to lock men up in jail the moment they

					<p>Each colony came out of the Revolution as an independent state, its loyalty to congress
						being dependent on its own will. Under the Articles of Confederation, which had created
						the congress, the war had been fought to a successful issue. It had raised armies,
						contracted loans, and levied taxes, but it had no power to compel the affiliation or
						loyalty of the states. It was a product of military necessity hastily called into
						existence, yet in spite of its imperfections it had survived the stormy period of war.
						It had one legislative body, the congress, with no senate, supreme court, or president
						to veto its acts. After the war the states, controlled by property owners, proceeded
						with legislation regardless of their neighbors. Each regulated commerce and levied
						duties in its own interests. If one state had endeavored to close her ports to English
						goods all the others would profit by her sacrifice. British ports were still closed
						against American merchants unless they patronized English ships. Thirteen different
						forms of legislation, more or less conflicting, produced anarchy and division. The
						ruling classes were more or less divided in their scramble for spoils and their opposing
						jealousies and interests may be seen from the following:</p>
					<p>"The commerce which Massachusetts found it to her interest to encourage, Virginia found
						it to her interest to restrict. New York would not protect the trade in indigo and
						pitch. South Carolina cared nothing for the success of the fur interests. New England
						derived great revenues from lumber, oil and potashes; Pennsylvania from corn and grain,
						and were in nowise concerned as to the prosperity of the trade of their neighbors.
						Articles which Connecticut and New Jersey excluded from their ports by heavy tonnage
						duties entered New York with scarcely any other charges than light money."<ref

					<pb id="VAC1311-104" n="104"/>

					<p>All this is evidence of the eagerness of each section of the wealthy classes to profit
						out of existing conditions without any regard to the interests of their class as a
						whole. That this is not a biased judgment may be shown by competent authorities. "There
						was everywhere," says Wilson, "the same jealous spirit, the same striving for every
						petty advantage, the same alert and aggressive selfishness."<ref id="ref_184"
							target="note_184" rend="super">6</ref> Von Holst is even more positive. "The
						acquisitions of the war," he writes, "were looked upon as so much booty, of which each
						state endeavored to secure the lion's share, without the least regard for the well-being
						or honor of the whole. <hi rend="i">In several instances, those who were willing to sell
							even the honor of their own state showed a bolder front and grew noisier in the hope
							of increasing their own personal share of the booty and of seeing it turned as soon as
							possible into jingling gold."</hi><ref id="ref_185" target="note_185" rend="super"
							>7</ref></p>
					<p>But the necessity for unity and a strong centralized government in behalf of the
						wealthy classes was soon revealed to them by a specter that appeared in the midst of
						their petty jealousies and scrambles for spoils. The army was restless for its pay and
						the government's finances were at a low ebb. A number of companies were on the verge of
						mutiny; one drove congress out of Philadelphia and another threatened uprising of
						veterans required the influence of Washington to quell. In fact, by 1790 Great Britain
						had distributed about $16,000,000 among about 4,000 of her loyalists, which "seems to
						have been much more ample than that which the ragged soldiers of our Revolutionary army
						ever received from congress."<ref id="ref_186" target="note_186" rend="super">8</ref>
						But the real specter was the growing discontent of the poor farmers and laborers who
						failed to secure all the blessings the Revolution had promised. Their frightful poverty
						drove them to desperation. Their "inalienable right to life" was a sham; their "liberty"
						was imprisonment for debt; their "pursuit of happiness" a phantom.</p>

						growing restlessness among the poor. Mass meetings were being held, petitions
						circulated, and demands made of legislatures for measures of relief. Debts had been
						contracted in depreciated currency and the wealthy classes were demanding payment in
						gold. Naturally, the poor debtors demanded paper currency and just as naturally their
						exploiters opposed it. The more paper that was issued the more demoralized the currency
						became. Historians have gone into hysterics in denouncing this demand of debtors for
						cheap money, but the fact, which we have referred to before, <hi rend="i">that

					<p>In some states men were on the march to the seats of county or state governments, many

						were raising prices and poor farmers saw in this an effort to defeat paper money. A law
						was rushed through the legislature commanding everyone to accept paper as an equivalent
						of gold. Violations of the act were subject to a fine of $500 and loss of the right of

						any produce to the cities. They tried to sell in Boston and New York, but met opposition
						in these cities. Their apples rotted and they burned corn for fuel. The farmers were
						threatened with force and town meetings were held in all parts of the state to consider
						the grave situation. Farmers became bankrupt, merchants left the state, and the only
						thing certain was universal uncertainty.</p>
					<p>The drum sounded in New Hampshire and several hundred men armed with muskets, swords
						and staves entered Exeter where the general court was sitting. They demanded a release
						from taxes and an issue of paper money. The lower house wavered, but the senate standing
						firm, the rebels were routed the next day.</p>
					<p>In Vermont demands were made that attorneys be expelled from the courts, that debts be
						cancelled and threats made that if relief measures were not passed force would be
						employed. Several hundred men were in the saddle and the courthouse at Rutland was
						surrounded with armed men led by Thomas Lee. <hi rend="i">He had fought with distinction

					<p>But the most alarming rebellion took place in Massachusetts, a revolt that took six
						months to suppress and one that sobered the ruling classes in their scramble for wealth.
						The farmers were in dire distress for their corn rotted on the ground. Money was scarce
						and they were reduced to the expedient of barter. Thousands signed pledges to resist any
						court that attempted to take their property and to resist the public sale of goods that
						had been taken to pay debts. Courts were invaded by large bodies of armed men and forced
						to suspend. Daniel Shays, an officer in the Continental army, who had fought at Bunker
						Hill, was chosen leader and the revolt grew to <note id="note_189"><ref target="ref_189"

							wealthy gentlemen" advanced sufficient funds for the purpose."</hi><ref id="ref_190"
							target="note_190" rend="super">12</ref></p>
					<p>The rebellion became so powerful and menacing that it attracted the attention of
						congress. That body gave a neat exhibition of "back stairs politics" that has become
						memorable in the secret history of the United States. Congress feared that the
						insurgents would capture the national arsenal at Springfield where there were at least
						450 tons of military stores, including bayonets, cannon, powder, shot and shell. The
						arsenal was in the midst of the discontented population and Secretary of War Knox was
						directed by congress to go to Springfield and take such measures as he might deem
						necessary to protect it. Before he arrived the rebels had already confronted Major
						General Shepard's troops, <hi rend="i">"many of them men of much substance both in
							wealth and character."</hi><ref id="ref_191" target="note_191" rend="super">13</ref>
						Shays appeared at the time for assembling the court and a conference resulted in an
						agreement that both sides should disband. Knox was left in the dilemma of protecting the
						arsenal which was a difficult task, for the mere knowledge that the state was collecting
						troops would provoke an immediate attack from the rebels. On the other hand, Governor
						Bowdoin could not ask for federal forces and congress could not recruit them openly
						without warning the rebels. The insurgents, though not active, were masters of the
						situation.</p>
					<p>Knox reported the situation to congress and the matter was referred to a committee. The
						committee recommended an increase in the army of 1,340 non-commissioned officers and
						privates. This would make the total force 2,040. The report, and resolutions
						accompanying it, was adopted. One would expect that the resolutions would refer to the
						troubles in Massachusetts, but instead of this <hi rend="i">they were filled with
							startling reports of alleged preparations</hi>

						<hi rend="i">for war being made by several Indian nations.</hi> This report was intended
						for popular consumption and a shield to cover the real intentions of congress.</p>
					<p><hi rend="i">The following day a secret report was presented by the same committee and
							adopted by Congress.</hi> This one dealt frankly with Shays' rebellion, mentioned the
						perilous position of the arsenal, stated that "particular circumstances" prevented the
						governor and council from asking for aid in a formal manner, that troops must be raised,
							<hi rend="i">but that the insurrection must not be mentioned as a reason for raising
							them and that the Indians would serve as a pretext.</hi></p>
					<p>Congress unanimously adopted a proposal of the treasury department that a requisition
						of $530,000 in specie be laid in due quotas on the states. "On the credit of this
						requisition a loan of $300,000, bearing interest at six per cent, might at once be
						opened." To stimulate subscriptions to the loan congress <hi rend="i">"warned the
							wealthy men of New England to contribute generously, unless they wished to see the new
							recruits mutiny for lack of pay and go over to the insurgents."</hi> GENERAL LINCOLN
						PERSONALLY SOLICITED SUBSCRIPTIONS FROM THE WEALTHY MEN OF BOSTON AND OTHER TOWNS,
						"TELLING THE CONTRIBUTORS THAT IT WAS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF ADVANCING A PART OF THEIR
						PROPERTY IN ORDER TO SAVE THE REST!"</p>
					<p>On October 22d, Knox notified Governor Bowdoin of the quota of troops required of
						Massachusetts and the governor, in transmitting the information to the general court,
						enlarged on the dangers of an Indian war. But the followers of Shays throughout the
						state suspected the troops were meant for them and not the Indians. As Gerry wrote to
						King: "Some of the country members laugh and say the Indian war is only a political one
						to obtain a standing army." However, the troops were secured by the money advanced by
						rich men, some of whom enlisted to crush the rebellion. Attacks and counter attacks were
						made extending over six months before the revolt was crushed. The <pb id="VAC1311-109"
							n="109"/> rebels had no funds or provisions and in the final rout some were frozen to
						death and others died of hunger and exposure. A price was placed on Shays' head and a
						large number arrested, of whom 300 were pardoned, 14 sentenced to death, eight of these
						being pardoned and the remainder reprieved conditionally.<ref id="ref_192"
							target="note_192" rend="super">14</ref> As a fitting climax to this historic drama the
						city of Boston, a few years ago, erected a memorial tablet in memory of Daniel
						Shays!</p>
					<p>Just as in Bacon's Rebellion more than 100 years before, the followers of Shays were
						charged by the wealthy classes with being communists prompted with the desire to
						overthrow all authority and property. This recalls a brilliant passage in the "Communist
						Manifesto" of Marx and Engels. "Where is the party in opposition?" they ask, "that has
						not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where the opposition that has
						not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism, against the more advanced opposition
						parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?"</p>
					<p>These rebellions taught the ruling classes that their supremacy was not secure and that
						a strong unified government was necessary to prevent the capture of the state
						governments by those of the debtor class who were still able to qualify for the
						suffrage. The Continental Congress was nearly dead and there appeared no legal method to
						secure the changes the ruling classes wanted. But just as the rulers in settlement times
						did not hesitate at fraud, force and confiscation to secure the natural resources, so
						the "Fathers" did not hesitate to employ the same means to attain their ends. Besides,
						they were confident that Shays had "intended, if possible, to seize the capital, take
						possession of the archives, and proclaim a provisional government."<ref id="ref_193"

					<p>All the leading authorities agree that these rebellions and particularly the one in
						Massachusetts had a great influence in driving the "Fathers" to the Constitutional
						convention which assembled in Philadelphia in 1787. This gathering had no more power to
						give a new constitution to the United States than an old maid's sewing circle had. For a
						long time there had been some dispute between Maryland and Virginia as to the regulation
						of trade on the Potomac river. In 1785 Washington "became president of a company for
						extending the navigation of the Potomac and James rivers."<ref id="ref_196"

						"Fathers" observed this provision also.</p>
					<p>On assembling in Philadelphia in May the delegates closed the doors of the convention
						to the outside world, made it a secret body, and threw their instructions in the waste
						basket. "It was plain from the first days of the convention that a goodly number of the
						delegates&mdash;and among them many of the most distinguished men&mdash;would not limit
						themselves to a literal interpretation of their powers."<ref id="ref_198"

						as a "fortunate circumstance,"<ref id="ref_199" target="note_199" rend="super">21</ref>
						as indeed it was, for only by such treachery could the delegates frame the scheme of
						government which they had in mind. They were there to establish a government that would
						suppress poor debtors' revolts and enthrone property more securely. Washington had
						already expressed his panic in a letter to Secretary of War Knox. "There are
						combustibles," he wrote, "in every state to which a spark might set fire."<ref

					<p>There were fifty-five delegates present, all of them distinguished for wealth or

						should consult with the ouside world or take any record from the official minutes
						without unanimous consent. For four months the delegates met and discussed, but the

					<p>Madison's "Journal of the Constitutional Convention" is our chief source of information
						regarding the proceedings, and as he was aggressive in every move to eliminate the

						to place himself and colleagues in as favorable light as possible. He informs his
						readers that he took notes because of the value he knew they would be to future
						generations. His "Journal" is filled with speeches expressing contempt for the
						aspirations of the masses and he reports himself uttering like sentiments.</p>
					<p>The first thing that strikes us in his record is the fact that Randolph presented a
						plan of government that completely abolished the old Confederation and was in plain

						it impossible for him to speak often and he frequently wrote his speeches and had one of
						his colleagues, Wilson, read them to the delegates. On August 7th he had listened for
						hours as speaker after speaker urged control of the government by property holders. He
						arose from his seat and without any preparation spoke in part as follows:</p>
					<p>"It is of great consequence that we should not depress the virtue and public spirit of
						our common people; of which they displayed a great deal during the war, and which <note

						. He was persuaded, also, that such a restriction as was proposed would give great
						uneasiness in the populous states. The sons of a substantial farmer, not being
						themselves freeholders, would not be pleased at being disfranchised, and there are a
						great many persons of that description."<ref id="ref_212" target="note_212" rend="super"
							>34</ref> Three days later he again listened to speeches urging control by property
						and again made his plea for the workers without property. <hi rend="i">Franklin's two
							speeches are the only pleas made in behalf of popular suffrage in the convention. Not
							one delegate endorsed his views.</hi></p>
					<p>It would seem that shame, even in the absence of a belief in the principle, would have
						prompted these "Fathers" to give some heed to the claims of the poor who, as Franklin
						said, "contributed principally to the favorable issue" of the war. But they were lost to
						all sense of shame or even gratitude. Even Wilson, a delegate from Franklin's state who
						held many popular views, was not willing to assist in battering down the property
						qualifications that existed in all the states, though eleven years had passed since it
						was declared that "all men are free and equal." There were many times when the
						discussions became heated; many times when the delegates seemed hopelessly divided; but
						on this one question of allowing the workers to remain excluded from the suffrage, they
						were unanimous.</p>
					<p>The general plan of the delegates consisted of a repudiation of instructions, overthrow
						of the Articles of Confederation, and establishment of a stronger government by the
						aristocracy. This required the secrecy which they provided for. Their scheme of
						government was to have one legislative department elected direct by the qualified
						voters, to "inspire confidence" in the scheme, as one speaker expressed it, and a
						senate, executive and supreme court removed from popular control and having power to
						check the congress. To buttress this by making it almost impossible to amend the
						constitution, was their aim. Prof. J. Allen Smith asserts that <hi rend="i">"In 1900 one
							forty-fourth of the</hi>
						<note id="note_212"><ref target="ref_212" rend="super">34</ref> Ibid, Vol. II, p.

						<hi rend="i">population distributed so as to constitute a majority in the twelve
							smallest states could defeat any proposed amendment."</hi><ref id="ref_213"
							target="note_213" rend="super">35</ref></p>
					<p>It is interesting to note that the courts now exercising the power to set aside laws
						enacted by congress were denied this power even by these aristocrats. Madison and Wilson
						urged a clause giving this power to the supreme court and president as a council of
						revision and the suggestion was voted down four times. <hi rend="i">Yet the courts today
							exercise this power expressly withheld from them by this negative vote.</hi></p>
					<p>The constitution as finally agreed on was not a unanimous choice. A number refused to
						sign it for various reasons. Some signed reluctantly; others refused, holding that
						certain interests were not protected enough or that others received undue consideration.
						Section 3 of Article 4 contained a fugitive slave clause applying to white slaves as
						well as negroes. This clause is still seen in printed copies and reads as follows:</p>
					<p><hi rend="i">"No person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof,
							escaping into another, shall, in consequence, of any law or regulation therein, be
							discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party
							to whom such service or labor may be due."</hi></p>
					<p>This clause shows that the "Fathers" were willing to invade state rights in the
						function of slave catcher, but not to invade them in the matter of suffrage for the
						working people. This legalized hunt of whites and blacks, extending over several
						centuries and embodied in various legal codes, had been so ingrained in the philosophy
						of the aristocrats who gave us the constitution that they could not refrain from
						bequeathing it to the nineteenth century. Of course, their material interests were the
						urge behind them.</p>
					<p>That our view of these men and the character of the government they organized is
						correct has been shown by the testimony of the framers themselves. No less an authority
						than Woodrow Wilson, the conservative <note id="note_213"><ref target="ref_213"
								rend="super">35</ref> Smith, "The Spirit of American Government," p. 46.</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-117" n="117"/> president of Princeton University, endorses this claim.
						"The government had," he writes, "been originated and organized upon the initiative and
						primarily in the interest of the mercantile and wealthy classes. Originally conceived as
						an effort to accommodate commercial disputes between the states, it had been urged to
						adoption by a minority, under the concerted leadership of able men representing a ruling
							class."<ref id="ref_214" target="note_214" rend="super">36</ref> This is quite in
						contrast with the assertion of that great bluffer, Gladstone, who said "The American
						Constitution is the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and
						purpose of man." We can only consider it wonderful in the sense that it is the most
						remarkable instance in history of a document having all the essentials of a charter of
						aristocracy, being viewed by a gaping multitude as a guarantee of popular rule. But the
						reception accorded this "wonderful document" by large numbers of people was far from
						reassuring to the conspirators. Bitter criticism came from the dependent classes though
						it found much favor with the wealthy. Hamilton, Madison and others feared that their
						four months of treachery would go for nothing. This in spite of the fact that the
						Constitution was not to be submitted to the qualified voters, but to state conventions
						which the aristocracy would have good chances of controlling.</p>
					<p>The constitution as submitted was a series of compromises and "bargains" agreed on
						between the different sections of the wealthy classes. "The fear in which the little
						states stood of the great secured the compromise giving representation to states. The
						hatred felt by the slave states for the free caused the second compromise, giving
						representation to slaves. The jealousy between states agricultural and states commercial
						brought about the third compromise on the slave trade and commerce."<ref id="ref_215"

						constitution to the state conventions showed that its partisans had no intention
						whatever of allowing it to "stand or fall upon its own merits." On the contrary, knowing
						that its "merits" appealed only to the wealthy classes, trickery, bribery, force and
						deception were employed to secure its adoption and even then it was not carried by a
						majority vote. The wealthy classes had an advantage in the restricted franchise, but
						they added two more weapons to their armory. These were gerrymandering the districts
						against the poorer classes who could vote, and the publication of "The Federalist,"
						employing in this all the arts of sophistry and deception to win converts for the
						constitution. In an illuminating chapter, entitled "The Political Depravity of the
						Fathers," Professor McMaster writes of the methods used to convince voters of the
						"merits" of public questions at that time. "A very little study of long forgotten
						politics," he says, "will suffice to show that in filibustering and gerrymandering, in
						stealing governorships and legislatures, in using force at the polls, in colonizing and
						in distributing patronage, . . . <hi rend="i">in all the frauds and tricks that go to

					<p>The "worst form of politics" became a valuable asset in demonstrating the "merits" of

					<p>"The Federalist," on the other hand, appeared from time to time with well written
						essays by Madison, Hamilton and Jay which appeared in the New York Packet and other
						papers. In these essays the schemers changed front. In the secret convention they avow
						their contempt and fear of the masses and of popular rule. In "The Federalist" they
						appear as champions and defenders of both and offer the constitution as the best
						guarantee of popular liberty. It is amusing to note, in this connection, that these
						essays are drummed into the heads of guileless youths in American universities by the
						intellectual policemen who guard the "higher learning" of today.</p>
					<p>There were 85 of these essays: 51 written by Hamilton, 29 by Madison and 5 by Jay. It
						was a scholarly publication and the authors presented the constitution in the most
						favorable light. They well knew that the official journals of the convention containing
						a record of their real sentiments were beyond the scrutiny of the eager multitudes. In
						the convention, as we have seen, they were born aristocrats speaking boldly in behalf of
						the wealthy; in the <hi rend="i">Federalist</hi> they are advocates of democracy. No one
						could confront the articles in the <hi rend="i">Federalist</hi> with the speeches
						delivered behind closed doors. Yet McMaster suspends all candid judgment when he says
						"That the work (of the <hi rend="i">Federalist</hi>) is a true statement of what the

					<p>A few extracts from this publication contrasted with the speeches delivered in the
						"Dark Conclave," as the constitutional convention came to be known, will satisfy any
						candid reader as to whether these men were honest in their appeals or were only
						political demagogues. Madison, who in the secret convention said that "the rights of
						property and the public liberty will not be secure in their (the workers') hands," now
						writes in the <hi rend="i">Federalist</hi> as follows:</p>
					<p>"The first question that offers itself is, whether the general form and aspect of the
						government be strictly republican. It is evident that no other form would be
						reconcilable with the genius of the people of America; with the principles of the
						Revolution; or with the honorable (!) determination which animates every votary of
						freedom (!!) to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for
							self-government."<ref id="ref_221" target="note_221" rend="super">43</ref> The answer
						to his own enquiry is that the constitution is everything that the "votaries of freedom"
						could wish or expect, and he elaborates on this assertion in 51 essays, drawing on the
						experience and history of ancient and modern republics, to convince his readers. The
						question is, was Madison lying in the <hi rend="i">Federalist</hi> or in the secret
						convention at Philadelphia?</p>
					<p>Hamilton, who in the convention urged that the senate and president be elected for life
						and who repeatedly avowed his contempt for the "vices of democracy," now sends forth
						this appeal: "The fabric of American empire ought to rest on the solid basis of the
						consent of the people. The streams of national power ought to flow immediately from that
						pure original fountain of all legitimate authority!"<ref id="ref_222" target="note_222"
							rend="super">44</ref> Was Hamilton a convert to "vices" he hated or was he still the

					<p>To this sophistry we may reply in the cutting words of Professor Smith: "The evidence

						'concealments and misrepresentations' made with this show of righteous indignation
						against the opponents of the constitution <hi rend="i">might have justly been made

					<p>However, the scholarly attainments of the treacherous pleaders and the ingenius

					<p>Opponents of the document had a powerful argument in pointing out the important fact

					<p>It was adopted by a minority vote. Many farmers' sons, wandering teachers and lawyers

					<head rend="center b">The Aftermath</head>

					<p>We have traced the development of class rule in America over three centuries and it
						remains for us to briefly consider the development which followed the adoption of the
						Constitution of the United States. The new government placed the privileged classes
						firmly in the saddle and the new century brought with it the first great awakening of
						labor. Attempts to organize and improve the conditions under which the workers had
						labored for centuries provoked retaliation from the master employers. The first struggle
						of the working class was to win the right to struggle&mdash;the right to organize
						unmolested and acquire by their own efforts some measure of freedom which the Revolution
						denied them.</p>
					<p>The first section of the labor army to feel the blows of the capitalist "votaries of
						freedom" was the sailors in New York, in 1802. At this period the hours of labor were
						generally from sunrise to sunset. At Albany the wages were forty cents per day and in
						Pennsylvania six dollars per month in summer and five in winter. The average wages were
						about $65 per year, including board. Out of this sum the workers were expected to feed
						and clothe their families. The sailors at New York who were receiving $10 per month
						struck for fourteen. They marched through the city persuading others to join them when
						the constables were sent in pursuit, broke the strike, and jailed the leader.<ref
							id="ref_229" target="note_229" rend="super">1</ref> So ended the first strike in
						America.</p>
					<p>The next struggle was at Philadelphia, in 1806, where the Cordwainers were indicted for
						conspiracy for attempting to raise their wages. It was the first of many trials of this
						kind extending over a period of forty years, and it is <note id="note_229"><ref

						based on the <hi rend="i">common law of England which included the bloody legislation
							against the disinherited mentioned in our first chapter.</hi></p>
					<p>The Cordwainers were boot and shoemakers and the evidence brought out in the trial
						showed they had organized to protect themselves against the master employers who had
						organized to advance their common interests. Organizations of the masters, however, were
						never indicted for conspiracy. In this first conspiracy case the jury was composed
						almost entirely of small business men and shop-keepers as follows: three grocers, two
						innkeepers, a merchant, a tobacconist, a tavern-keeper, a hatter, a bottler, a
						watchmaker and a "taylor." <hi rend="i">A shoemaker was drawn as one of the jurors and
							rejected because of his occupation.</hi> The strikers were charged with unlawfully
						assembling to "unjustly and corruptly conspire, combine, confederate and agree together
						that none of them, the said conspirators, would work for any master . . . who would
						employ any artificer, workman or journeyman . . . who should thereafter infringe or
						break" the unlawful rules and orders of the boot and shoemakers.</p>
					<p>The most important testimony presented by the prosecution was that given by a member
						who secretly scabbed on the union while serving on the strike committee. During the
						progress of his testimony a disturbance is heard in the court room. A striker is brought
						forward and fined ten dollars for contempt of court. He had said, "A scab is shelter for
						lice." The offender pays the fine and "justice" is appeased.</p>
					<p>A master employer is called to the witness stand. "Have the masters a society?" he is
						asked. Not at all. ". . . they may sometimes meet together, but they keep no accounts of
						their proceedings, they may meet as people meet before an election, to consult on the
						affairs of the moment, but nothing regular." Is there anything more innocent than this?
						Nothing more harmless. Their counsel argue that the masters are prompted by patriotic
						motives and regard for the public weal in prosecuting this unlawful <pb id="VAC1311-126"
							n="126"/> conspiracy. The "public" sits in the jury box as "impartial" judges of the
						evidence.</p>
					<p>Counsel for the defense riddles the patriotic claims of the prosecution. "We are told
						that this prosecution is brought forward from public motives," but "when you see a
						formidable band of masters attending on the trial of this cause; . . . and when you see
						further, that it is not taken up by any of their customers, it will require strong
						arguments to convince you it is done out of pure patriotic motives." He goes to the
						heart of the matter. "It is nothing more or less than this," he exclaims, "whether the
						wealthy master shoemakers . . . shall charge you and me what price they please for our
						boots and shoes, and at the same time have the privilege of fixing the wages of the poor
						journeymen they happen to employ." This sounds like a counter-charge of conspiracy, but
						its logic does not appeal to the "public." It is decidedly "unreasonable" and the real
						conspirators are the men who toil. The verdict reads: <hi rend="i">"We find the
							defendants guilty of a combination to raise their wages."</hi> They are fined eight
						dollars each with costs of the suit and are committed till paid.<ref id="ref_230"
							target="note_230" rend="super">2</ref> The convicted men opened a boot and shoe
						warehouse appealing to "public liberality to save themselves and families from abject
							poverty."<ref id="ref_231" target="note_231" rend="super">3</ref></p>
					<p>In short, <hi rend="i">the Revolution had simply bequeathed to the workers, at the
							beginning of the nineteenth century, the barbarous conspiracy code of England enacted
							a century or two before!</hi> And these prosecutions for conspiracy continued in
						Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, and other states, and not till the
						first half of the century had passed into history did the workers establish the labor
						union as a legal institution of their class. What a commentary on the pretensions and
						glittering promises of the leading men of the Revolution!</p>
					<p>While this repressive work was going on the federal <note id="note_230"><ref

						<pb id="VAC1311-127" n="127"/> and state governments were carefully nursing manufactures
						with tariffs, bounties, subsidies, land grants and other forms of legislation. The
						experiment of Samuel Slater in Rhode Island with machinery and child labor was soon
						followed in other states. Land jobbers and speculators were also pushing westward,
						buying acres by the millions or purchasing "whole townships as fast as the surveyors
						could locate, buying on trust and selling for wheat, for lumber, for whatever the land
						could yield or the settler give."<ref id="ref_232" target="note_232" rend="super"
							>4</ref> The period between 1815 and 1830 witnessed a general employment of women and
						children in the factories and Hamilton's wish to exploit them was realized.</p>
					<p>By 1831 some of the factories became torture chambers similar to those that gave
						British capitalists their blood-stained fortunes some decades before. "Women and
						children in the factories, . . ." says one writer, "were frequently beaten with cowhides
						and otherwise maltreated. An instance was shown of a deaf and dumb boy receiving a
						hundred lashes from his neck to his feet; and another of the breaking of the leg of an
						eleven-year-old girl by a club thrown at her by an employer."<ref id="ref_233"
							target="note_233" rend="super">5</ref></p>
					<p>Massachusetts "democracy," with its old trade-mark, also appears with the rise of the
						factory system. Corporation boarding houses and corporation churches became adjuncts to
						the factories and employes could only get work by signing contracts that rigidly bound
						them to the sweaters of labor. The Lowell Manufacturing company's rules, 1830-1840,
						provided that all employes must board at the company house and observe its minute
						regulations; all must go to church and must work twelve months unless two weeks' notice
						of intention to quit is given. Other detail regulations are considered part of the
						contract.</p>
					<p>During the same period the Cocheco Manufacturing company, at Dover, New Hampshire, has
						contracts with its "hands" by which the latter agree not to join any labor organization
						and if they do they forfeit the wages due <note id="note_232"><ref target="ref_232"

						<pb id="VAC1311-128" n="128"/> them; they agree to accept such wages "as the company may
						see fit to pay"; they are subject to fines; two cents per week are deducted for a sick
						fund; they agree not to leave the employ of the company without giving two weeks'
						notice, and if they do they forfeit two weeks' pay, and if discharged they are not
						entitled to their wages until two weeks after discharge.<ref id="ref_234"
							target="note_234" rend="super">6</ref> The employes of these factories were nearly all
						girls. Corporation paternalism became rampant. The girls not only slept in company
						houses, but patronized company stores. Some corporations maintained churches, paid the
						preacher's salary, collected pew rents from the operatives, and held out fixed sums from
						their wages for the welfare of their souls! Six and eight girls frequently occupied the
						same bed chamber and the hours of labor varied from twelve in summer to fourteen in
							winter.<ref id="ref_235" target="note_235" rend="super">7</ref></p>
					<p>Meantime the working class was organizing in spite of prosecutions for conspiracy. "The
						long hours of labor, the liability of imprisonment for debt, . . . the need of a lein
						law, the impossibility of educating their children in a land where education counted for
						so much, were to them grievances of a serious kind."<ref id="ref_236" target="note_236"
							rend="super">8</ref> They decided, many of them, to organize politically. The
						Workingman's Party of New York City was organized in 1829. The press that yawped and
						chanted the praises of the dominant class now served it like faithful lackeys. The new
						party became the "Infidel Ticket"; the "rights of property, religion and order" were in
						danger; the "mob" threatened the foundations of society. In short, it was a rehash of
						the panic-stricken cry of the plunderers during Bacon's Rebellion, in 1676, Shays'
						Rebellion following the Revolution, and the same is heard today, with some variations,
						hurled against the modern Socialist movement. The plunderer is always the first to hide
						behind religion, morality and property when his victims rise to redress past and present
						wrongs.</p>
					<p>Some forty of fifty labor papers came into existence <note id="note_234"><ref
								target="ref_234" rend="super">6</ref> Abbott, "Women in Industry," Appendices II and
							III.</note>
						<note id="note_235"><ref target="ref_235" rend="super">7</ref> Ibid, Chap. VII.</note>

						<pb id="VAC1311-129" n="129"/> demanding economic, social and political changes in the
						established regime. These papers were on the whole more advanced and aggressive than the
						pitiful, conservative, apologizing, labor press of today. In some cities the independent
						political action of the workers showed surprising strength. In Albany, New York, in
						1830, the workers carried four wards out of five and in Troy won another victory. In
						Philadelphia and other cities they also exercised considerable influence. Their official
						declarations contain demands that include every popular right and privilege won in the
						nineteenth century. The independent movement finally died because its active men were
						not sufficiently clear regarding the problems that faced them and were the prey of
						professional politicians, their promises and alliances. Yet the workers did great work
						while their descendants of today in the labor unions are allowing the courts to strip
						them of the weapons their fathers won. Courts now plunder union treasuries and the
						private purses of members; they have outlawed the boycott and legalized the blacklist;
						prohibited aid by sympathetic unions; jailed men for free speech, and in general,
						declared only such unions legal that contain spineless, unresisting men, who ask
						nothing, resent nothing and get nothing.</p>
					<p>In the early forties a distinguished Englishman came to our shores and came in contact
						with the "Great Republic of the Western World." When he returned home he wrote of what
						he saw and instantly the journalistic police squirted their venom on the great man's
						head. The great heart of Dickens revolted when he contemplated "the miserable
						aristocracy spawned of a false republic" and the public opinion that "knotted the lash,
						heated the branding iron, loaded the rifle, and shielded the murderer" of the slave. The
						vulgar brawlers in congress, agents of planter or capitalist, filled him with disgust.
						Congress had "sat calmly by, and heard a man, one of themselves, with oaths which
						beggars in their drink reject, threaten to cut another's throat from ear to ear." And
						what of the Inalienable Rights of Man? Why, "there are many kinds of hunters engaged in
						the Pursuit of Happiness, and they go variously <pb id="VAC1311-130" n="130"/> armed. It
						is the Inalienable Right of some among them to take the field after <hi rend="i"
							>their</hi> happiness equipped with cap and cartwhip, stocks and iron collar, and to
						shout their view halloa! (always in praise of Liberty) to the music of clanking chains
						and bloody stripes."</p>
					<p>And what of the press of that day? It is a "monster of depravity; when any private
						excellence is safe from its attacks; when . . . any tie of social decency and honor is
						held in the least regard; when any man in that Free Country has freedom of opinion, and
						presumes to speak for himself, . . . without humble reference to a censorship which, for
						its rampant ignorance and base dishonesty he utterly loathes and despises in his heart;
						when those who most acutely feel its infamy, . . . dare to set their heels upon, and
						crush it openly, in the sight of all men; then I will believe . . . men are returning to
						their manly senses. But while that press has its evil eye in every house, and its black
						hand in every appointment in the state, . . . while, with ribald slander for its only
						stock in trade, it is the standard literature of an enormous class, . . . so long must
						the evil it works be plainly visible in the Republic."<ref id="ref_237"
							target="note_237" rend="super">9</ref></p>
					<p>Dickens did not "understand the genius of American institutions" and to this day many
						exploiters find it impossible to forgive the great English author for the lashing he
						gave the ruling classes seventy years ago.</p>
					<p>During the period we have been considering the division between capitalist North and
						planter South became more acute. Even in the First Congress the debates between the
						political servants of the planter and those of the capitalist showed the conflict
						between them. Both struggled to secure the executive, judicial and legislative powers as
						these, in turn, gave police and military power to enforce the rule of either the one or
						the other. Down to the Civil war the exploiters of blacks controlled nearly every
						president and congress, but the northern masters gathered strength with the development
						of machinery and <note id="note_237"><ref target="ref_237" rend="super">9</ref> Dickens,
							"American Notes."</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-131" n="131"/> the factory system and the extension of both over a
						larger area.</p>
					<p>The Civil war swept the slave system into oblivion and the northern capitalist had a
						free field to the Gulf for sweating wage labor. "While the war was waged for political
						purposes, . . . it was in reality a great labor movement&mdash;not so intended, but so
						in result; for divested of all political significance, . . . it was a war of economic
						forces, . . . for the South had existed under a form of labor entirely antagonistic to
						that existing at the North. . . ."<ref id="ref_238" target="note_238" rend="super"
							>10</ref> The negro was merged with the white laborer into the one class of wage
						laborers both selling and having nothing to sell but their muscles, tissues and blood in
						order to live. The capitalist class has also come into possession of the greatest powers
						of wealth-production the world has ever known and these have been organized into
						powerful combines all more or less related to each other in interest and constituting
						one mighty ruling class of owners, controlling government and press, school and
						platform, and shaping all institutions to accord with their interests. Judges,
						legislators, presidents and governors represent, by class or family relationship or
						association, this all-powerful ruling class and do its will. Each state with its
						governing powers is the private domain of the controlling combines within its borders,
						while the naked and shameless debauchery of their political agents are revealed in every
						investigation of city and state.</p>
					<p>The capitalist system of production has at the same time been developing the crisis
						that must sweep it out of existence like other historic forms of class rule. The ruling
						class is unable to prevent the breakdown of the colossal powers in its hands; the
						collapse comes every ten or fifteen years in the form of an industrial crisis, the last
						one always more terrible in the suffering and ruin it brings than the one preceding it.
						Millions are beggared for lack of opportunity to place bread and meat on their tables.
						Though millions suffer for lack of opportunity to operate <note id="note_238"><ref
								target="ref_238" rend="super">10</ref> Wright, "Industrial Evolution of the United
							States,' p. 152.</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-132" n="132"/> the machinery, the owners stand in the background
						posessing judge, policeman and soldier and with these command the laborers, "hands off!"
						Unable to manage industry itself the capitalist class will not permit the laborers to
						enter the factories and relieve their distress.</p>
					<p>The opportunities of employment are not owned or managed with regard to human welfare.
						They are simply agencies for the enrichment of idle capitalists, most of whom never saw
						the factories they own. When the workers produce more than the owners can sell or the
						workers buy, the plants are closed and society becomes a stockade; the workers are
						penned within sight of the billions they produce; within reach of the machinery to
						produce billions more, and yet are barred from both.</p>
					<p>Even during times of so-called "prosperity" capitalist society is, in the words of
						Professor Ely, "an imperfect social organism. It moves forward, creaking, and groaning
						and splashes the blood of its victims over us all. Our food, our clothing, our shelter,
						all our wealth, is covered with stains and clots of blood." The upstart parvenue rich,
						whose ancestors stole their original accumulations, draw the children of the workers
						within their factory hells and sweat gold from their tender, helpless little bodies.
						Their fathers and mothers also sell their labor power for a pittance. The waking hours
						of the worker are devoted to securing food for his family, and working under such
						conditions that often deprive him of the bodily vigor, leisure and comfort of the
						cave-man of the primitive world. Millions live in chronic pauperism and slowly rot and
						die because of lack of nourishment. Protests and strikes of laborers are met with clubs,
						jails and injunctions, or silenced with the soldier's bullet. All life, all progress,
						all institutions, are held and shaped to serve the wishes of a class that is no more
						necessary or useful to society today than the driveling idiot who rules the unhappy
						people of Spain.</p>
					<p>This is the civilization that four centuries of progress and achievement in America has
						given us, and just as our review of the past century has shown that the political <pb
							id="VAC1311-133" n="133"/> parties of that time never at any time mentioned the real
						issues that concerned the workers, so the dominant parties today have no message for
						them. The reason for this is apparent. These parties, past and present, are the parties
						of the ruling classes. Their appeals are based on "patriotism," "morality," "the flag,"
						and other vapid claptrap. They are incapable of understanding that "Love and business
						and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a
						man's starving."</p>
					<p>They are bankrupt. They are worse. No one can say worse of them than many who have been
						with them, learned of their foul practices and witnessed their crimes. Every election
						they participate in is a disgrace to the human family. Every such occasion brings them
						into close alliance with the thug and the pimp, and the unfortunate, rotting degenerates
						clinging to the lowest layers of society. These come forth from their holes and cellars
						in every American city and are "rounded up" with funds provided by bankers, merchants,
						capitalists and other "pillars of society." Thuggery, "booze," and boodle are a
						necessary part of their work. S. S. McClure, of "McClure's Magazine," says that in
						American cities we have "government by criminals." Judge Ben B. Lindsey's story<ref
							id="ref_239" target="note_239" rend="super">11</ref> of the criminals ruling Denver
						and Colorado&mdash;composing both political parties, the business men, bankers,
						capitalists, and even some clergymen&mdash;of their destruction of boys and girls and
						other infamies that almost stagger belief, shows the degradation and debauchery of
						capitalist rule.</p>
					<p>This is a natural legacy of the past. From the history of class rule in America nothing
						better could be expected. But the end is drawing near and the curtain is about to rise
						on a better and nobler stage of history. The development of the factory system and the
						concentration of industries draw large masses of workers into workshops working for the
						same masters, under the same rules and under the same common conditions of servitude.
						The machine enters the factory and under their very eyes absorbs their skill and throws
						hosts of them out of <note id="note_239"><ref target="ref_239" rend="super">11</ref>
							Lindsey and O'Higgins, "The Beast."</note>
						<pb id="VAC1311-134" n="134"/> employment. Out of their common servitude comes a
						consciousness of unity and fellowship in the struggle for bread. This solidarity finds
						its first expression in the trades union where the workers unite to give battle to those
						who live on their sweat and blood. The workers are forced to unite or go down in defeat
						as a servile, cringing, degraded class. Pressure from above molds them into a closer
						unity and class consciousness is born of their contact with each other.</p>
					<p>However, when they leave the factory on strike they find that the capitalist has
						summoned the judge to post an injunction on the factory gates; the mayor to provide him
						with clubs; the governor to provide him with bayonets and the president to give him
						Federal soldiers. All these officials obey his commands. The workers have united in the
						factory and divided at the polls, giving their ballots to one or the other of two
						parties controlled by the owners of the factory. The party in turn gives its owners the
						police and military powers necessary to beat the insurgent workers into submission. The
						class struggle, ever present in capitalist society, is revealed in all its brutality,
						and broken heads and weltering bodies attest its grim reality. Unity at the ballot box
						to secure possession of the legislative, judicial, police and military powers is also
						revealed <hi rend="i">and independent Socialist politics is born.</hi></p>
					<p>Socialism, having for its object the industrial and political unity of workingmen,
						will, when triumphant, restore the magnificent resources of America to the workers from
						whom they were stolen in the first place. It will transfer to the people all the mills,
						mines, factories, railways, and all the other powers of wealth-production and
						distribution to be publicly owned, operated and managed by all in the interest and for
						the common good of all. Capitalist ownership for capitalist enrichment will be replaced
						by common ownership in behalf of the useful wealth producers.</p>
					<p>The machine and factory system are both the social achievements of all the workers of
						the past and present. Each generation has improved the wealth-productive powers of their
						time and passed them on to their children who performed a like service for the race.
						These powers <pb id="VAC1311-135" n="135"/> incarnate the blood and tears and genius of
						all the workers that have gone before, and to allow a few idle capitalists and stock
						gamblers to possess them and juggle with the happiness of millions is a crime against
						the human race.</p>
					<p>Class ownership must give way to the next Revolution, the revolution that will place
						the workers in possession of the governing and industrial powers of today. Co-operative
						labor in the factories must be supplemented with co-operative ownership and control.
						Capitalist society itself has developed the framework of the new Socialist society. We
						do not have to build, but transform. Co-operative social production is displacing
						individual hand methods in all fields of industry. The owners are simply gamblers on the
						toil of the workers. Owning sugar stock today they trade it for steel tomorrow; for
						railway stock the next, day, and for other stock the next, and so on without end. They
						never know the plants the stocks represent, or the process of producing the given
						commodities within them. As gamblers or idle owners sailing the seas they perform no
						service of use to mankind. They must go the way of the baron of the crags and the Roman
						masters when they no longer serve society in a useful capacity.</p>
					<p>The response the workers get for their demand is the response every ruling class in
						history has given to the demands of its victims. "You will overthrow morality, break up
						the family, destroy religion," and all the other institutions of today. Yet the
						capitalist class drags all these in the muck and mire and makes a wretched botch of
						everything it touches. The thinking worker laughs at these pretenses and adds to the
						number of those who prepare to topple over the vulgar parvenues and the servile parrots
						who sing their praises.</p>
					<p>The modern Socialist can well stand erect knowing that the Socialist movement has
						gathered to itself the scholarship, learning, science and philosophy of the nineteenth
						and twentieth centuries. In no political gatherings outside of the Socialist movement
						are the writings of the great philosophers and scientists discussed and appreciated.
						This movement represents not only the next political, social and <pb id="VAC1311-136"
							n="136"/> industrial advance of mankind, but it also preserves the culture and
						learning of our time. What use have capitalist parties for the names or writings of
						Marx, Engels, Huxley, Darwin, Tolstoy, London, Buckle, Ibsen, and the host of others
						that have enriched the literature of the world? The Socialist movement will hand this
						rich legacy on to the people of the future while its enemies will only leave the memory
						of the evil they have done and merit the contempt of mankind.</p>
					<p>The final fruition of the workers' struggles in America is not hard to predict. Blunder
						as we may, go down in defeat as often as we will; betrayed by some, deserted by others,
						and our advance retarded by the timid and faltering, the hour will come when the working
						class with its new ideals&mdash;the greatest known in history&mdash;will stand on the
						summit of the modern world. They will clear the swamps and cesspools of society that
						remind us of the past and place the governing powers in the hands of all. Possession of
						these by all and for all will incarnate in all our institutions the fellowship that
						today is only found in its ripest form among the long-suffering, organized working
						class. They will transform every factory into a palace of art and every workshop into a
						studio where</p>
					<p>"ALL WILL BE JOY-SMITHS AND THEIR TASK SHALL BE TO BEAT OUT LAUGHTER FROM THE RINGING
						ANVIL OF LIFE."</p>
