            <p>An interesting souvenir of one of the most momentous events of the Civil war—the surrender
                    of Vicksburg by the southern general, Pemberton, to General Grant and Admiral Porter on July
                    4,1863—is in the proud possession of Mindwell Crampton Wilson. It is a genuine copy of
                    the edition of the <hi rend="i">Vicksburg Citizen</hi> issued on wall paper a few hours after the
                    union forces entered the fallen city at the end of the memorable siege, and is of special interest
                    to her because it was printed by her father, Col. A. B. Crampton, now of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and two subordinate printers.</p>
            <p>The life of Col. Crampton is in reality a history of Indiana newspapers during the long period of his
                    career as a printer and editor. Though now in his eighty-sixth year, he can hold the interest of the
                    younger generation by his most interesting narrative.</p>
            <p>Adelbert Bernard Crampton was born on March 8, 1843, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. At eleven years of age he was "bound out" or assigned to
                    the family of the Rev. Loyal A. Alford, a Baptist minister, who was then publishing the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                        </placeName> Review.</hi> In that office he commenced to learn the printer's trade. He
                    served there for several years until Alford sold the equipment, which was moved to Three Rivers, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, and "Del" Crampton, as he was known then, went along to help print
                    the <hi rend="i">Three Rivers Herald</hi>, the first paper printed in the town. At the time of his
                    service on the <hi rend="i">Review</hi>, it was the custom of newspaper men to exchange help when
                    they were crowded with work and "Del" was loaned on several occasions to the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                        </placeName> Democrat</hi>, then published by Robert Lowry, and on one occasion to the <hi rend="i">St. Joe Valley Register</hi> of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-025-3-002"/> published by Schuyler Colfax. After
                    serving his three years' apprenticeship, young Crampton worked on several newspapers as a
                    tramp-printer, among them being the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                        </placeName> Enterprise</hi>, published by Archibald Beal, the <hi rend="i">Grand Rapids
                    Eagle</hi>, and the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Ligonier</settlement>
                        </placeName> Banner.</hi> In 1861, he drifted back to the office of the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                        </placeName> Review.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That paper boiled over with intense patriotism. A recruiting officer was conducting a campaign in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName>. One day at noon the editor, C. H. Chase, went home to dinner leaving his
                    "devil" in charge of the office. When he returned the "devil"
                    had taken unceremonious flight to volunteer in order to share the adventures of war with his pals
                    and give vent to the patriotic impulses that had been inspired by his association with the fiery
                    editor.</p>
            <p>The big, raw-boned, courageous "Private Del", six feet and two inches in height,
                    became Color Sergeant Crampton of the 48th Indiana infantry. He was serving in that capacity, when,
                    a few days before the fall of Vicksburg, General Grant, knowing he would require the use of a
                    printing office as soon as the city should be occupied, issued a call for printers in the ranks to
                    volunteer for that duty. Crampton and two others were selected from the number of volunteers, with
                    the Sergeant detailed as foreman of the trio. They received proper written authority to take
                    possession of any printing office in Vicksburg.</p>
            <p>Sergeant Cmampton decided that the office of the <hi rend="i">Vicksburg Citizen</hi> was best suited
                    to the purposes for which it was required, and he and his two typos took possession.</p>
            <p>On the composing stone they found the type (still undisturbed) of the last issue of the <hi rend="i">Daily Citizen</hi>, which had been printed on July 2, 1863, two days before. It wasn't
                    much of a paper, however—only four columns, each column 17 1/2 inches long. The issue had
                    been printed on the blank side of wallpaper, white print-paper stock having long since been
                    exhausted in Vicksburg. Being a newspaper man and interested in what the editor had been saying in
                    reference to the War, Crampton picked up that last copy and read the editorials. The first article
                    was headed <hi rend="i">"On Bit"</hi> and read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The great Ulysses—the Yankee generalissimo, surnamed Grant— has
                            expressed his intention of dining in Vicksburg on Saturday next and celebrating the Fourth
                            of July by a grand dinner and so forth. When asked if he would invite Gen Jo Jackson to
                            join, he said, "No. for fear <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-025-3-003"/> there would be a
                            row at the table." Ulysses must get into the city before he dines in it. The way to
                            cook a rabbit is first to "catch the rabbit."</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Crampton thought that a Union seizure of the town would be incomplete without some reply to the <hi rend="i">Citizen's</hi> statement. He shifted the original article two columns, seized
                    a printer's stick and with his own hands set up this reply: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Two days bring about great changes. The banner of the Union floats over Vicksburg. General
                            Grant has "caught the rabbit"; he has dined in Vicksburg and did bring his dinner
                            with him. The <hi rend="i">Citizen</hi> lives to see it. For the last time it appears on
                            wall-paper. No more will we eulogize the luxury of mule meat and fricasseed
                            kitten—urge southern warriors to such diet nevermore. This is the last
                            "wall-paper" edition and is, excepting this note, from the types as we
                            found them. It will be valuable hereafter as a souvenir.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Crampton was right. The next day a supply of paper was sent into town, and he set about using the
                    newspaper equipment to publish the dispatches.</p>
            <p>Upon his discharge from the army at the close of the war, the Rev. and Mrs. L. A. Alford with whom he
                    had formerly lived having moved from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Crampton went there and again became a member of the Alford family. Two years later he
                    married their youngest daughter Lovisa. She was a nine year old girl when he first met her. To this
                    union four children were born, Adelbert B., Charles C., Lovisa E., and Mindwell. The first-born died
                    in infancy. The others are residents of Indiana, all graduates of Purdue University and Mindwell
                    also a graduate of Indiana University.</p>

                    Democratic Central Committee of the State. For two years he served with Eb. Henderson as chairman;
                    for two years with Joe McDonald; and for two years with Wm. H. English.</p>

            <p>The recent razing of the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> building, at Market Street and Monument Circle, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, freshens my memory of an Indiana sculptor now well nigh forgotten, and never famous in
                    proportion to the work he actually did. A distinguishing feature of the building was a life-sized
                    statue of Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> that for more than half a century, from its elevated niche above the main entrance,
                    looked calmly out over this central spot of the city during the many changes of that period. There
                    still remain a few old citizens, among them myself, who remember when the statue in question was
                    unveiled. The exact date I am unable to fix but according to my recollection it was about 1874. The
                    event was of enough interest to attract a goodly crowd, and it was a matter of newspaper note that
                    the creator of this statue was a young man, untaught in art, who was serving his apprenticeship as a
                    stone-cutter in the yard of the Carpenter Brothers, which occupied the northwest corner of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and Meridian Streets. This firm had the contract for the stone work on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> building, and out of that fact arose the opportunity for the young genius to prove his
                    talent. Prior to this maiden effort and for a good while afterwards, it appears, he had no
                    instruction whatever in art. At that day in Indiana, indeed, there was small chance to learn
                    sculpturing and little sculpture to study. Mahoney, it is said, derived his inspiration chiefly from
                    the small pieces known as the Rogers groups, then popular as parlor ornaments. His ambition was to
                    study in <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName>, and to that end he began to save his earnings. By 1879, he was ready to accomplish his
                    purpose, though in the meantime he had married and assumed the responsibilities of a family. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName> he spent eighteen months in study. Particulars as to his stay there are meager, but

            <p>Presumably he did not see his way financially to prolong his studies. At any rate, in 1880, he

                    clear just where this was. Then there was a commission for a bronze group representing Pierre

            <p>Mr. Mahoney left very few notes or other data regarding himself or his work, aside from a fragmentary

                    his work. In his home city he is known only as the creator of the few pieces preserved there, and,
                    to most who read this sketch, it will doubtless be a surprise to learn of the number of his works to
                    be found scattered over the country. There are others beside those mentioned above of which little
                    is now known beyond the fact that they exist. Among them are a bust of James A. Garfield and several

            <p>Miss Mahoney tells an interesting ancedote in connection with the Harrison statue in Monument Place.
                    A distinguishing feature of this piece is a long military cloak which adds picturesqueness to the
                    figure. The first model of it, shown to the commission with whom rested its acceptance or rejection,
                    was without the garment named. It was accepted, but not with the unanimous approval craved by the
                    sculptor. This dissatisfied him, and while cudgelling his brain for a new conception that would
                    better come up to the mark, his wife suggested the addition of a cloak. He tried the suggestion,
                    making the figure as it now stands. This time approval by the commissioners was unanimous and
                    instantaneous. Thus, as the daughter humorously says, the cloak belonged to her mother.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mahoney was born in Usk, Monmouthshire, <placeName>

                    cemetery. For some years prior to his death, he did little or no work along the line of his chosen
                    profession. He became active in city affairs, occupying official positions during the two terms of

            <p>There was a time many years ago, when <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> was but a wilderness—a deep, dark, almost impenetrable forest, whose
                    occupants were wild beasts, feathered songsters, shiny reptiles and tribes of wild men. There were
                    no homes, no schools, no churches, but from the banks of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> to the
                    shores of the Northern Lakes, and on, on, there were vast forests and prairies, unknown to the white
                    man's tread.</p>
            <p>When our Indiana country was first explored by white men, it was the home of the Kickapoo,
                    Piankashaw, and Miami Indians. They lived in villages located along navigable streams. One such
                    village stood along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> at the present site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Near all the Indian villages were burying grounds, where the dead were interred. With
                    the dead warrior, were usually placed his weapons, his ornaments and a dish, or jar, containing
                    food, for the Indians believed that the spirit of the dead needed food as it journeyed to the
                    "happy hunting ground," which was their heaven. With the coming of white men into
                    this territory, there followed in his wake those things which made for civilization —the
                    family, the church, the school, agriculture, and trade. Life was not easy in any respect and many
                    were the premature deaths from disease and accidental causes. At first, burials were made in any
                    convenient spot, not apt to be molested by animals or Indians. These places became the family burial
                    grounds, a few of which still exist over the county—reminders of the fact that the family
                    in the primitive period was the essential unit around which most things revolved.</p>
            <p>The early settlers soon built churches and then cemeteries were plotted beside them. The oldest
                    cemetery, known as such, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName>, is located beside the St. Francis Xavier Cathedral. It was once of immense size, but
                    its boundaries, when it was most extensive, are not known. They were obliterated with the passing of
                    years and now only a few stones remain to mark the graves of some of the earlier inhabitants of the
                    little village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    Marie, wife of Judta Tratierini, was buried under the family pew in December, 1750.</p>
            <p>The first records of this cemetery beside the Cathedral date back to 1749. Many people of some fame
                    were laid to rest there. Father Rivet, the first public school teacher in the old Northwest
                    Territory, lies in an unmarked grave, as do many others. The "Daughters of
                    Isabelle" are preparing to erect a monument to his memory. This early cemetery was not
                    divided into lots as are the cemeteries of to-day, but the graves were made side by side in rows,
                    with no reference to family relationships.</p>
            <p>The best known of those whose remains repose in this cemetery are Captain Francis Bosseron and Jane
                    Beneau. The latter was the wife of Toussant Dubois who died in 1800. Her gravestone is the oldest
                    one still standing. The grave of the wife of General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Johnston is in this cemetery. Mr. Johnston was the first Mason of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He founded the local Masonic lodge which has had an unbroken history down to the
                    present. This old cemetery was used until 1846, when the "Mt. Calvary Cemetery"
                    was laid out. Some of the bodies were removed from the old to the new burying ground in that year.</p>
            <p>At the same time with the growth of the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there was also the gradual settlement of outlying districts of the County. The
                    "Upper Indiana Church Cemetery" is very old, with many historical stories related
                    concerning its location and its members. The origin of this cemetery was quite by accident or
                    chance. In the years just prior to, or immediately following 1800, settlers were coming into the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> area to find homes along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. The land was a tangle of woods and underbrush. Wild game and Indians were plentiful.
                    The settlers, many of whom had been granted land by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government because of their services during the Revolutionary War, found life
                    unrelenting and full of the hardships of the frontier, although <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been an established trading post for about a century.</p>
            <p>Thomas Emison with his wife and family made their way from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> into <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName>. He had been granted land in lieu of money for his Revolutionary services. Desiring <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-025-3-011"/> to find a suitable location for his home and farm out of the
                    high-water district, he passed through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and on to the northward. Here he hoped to find a high knoll for his block-house and
                    near by a creek large enough to furnish water the year around. When evening came on, at the end of
                    the first day's travel out of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he reached the place where the Upper Indiana Church now stands. The land was high and
                    dry, and here the family decided to camp for the night. A small creek near by furnished them water.</p>
            <p>In addition to the immediate family, there was a niece of Mrs. Emison. She had not stood the long and
                    arduous journey very well and before reaching <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> had fallen desperately ill. She did not survive the night at the new camp.</p>
            <p>The family was much saddened over this misfortune, but a new home must be found and necessity
                    demanded that they should move on in search of a suitable location. They decided to bury the girl
                    where they were encamped and mark the spot so that after they were settled, they could easily find
                    it again. As already noted, they had made camp on a high knoll. Two yew trees stood as sentinels
                    side by side on this little elevation. A grave was dug between them, and the last sad rites were
                    performed for the young woman. The grave had been made before the coming of dawn and by the time the
                    eastern sky was streaked with grey, a campfire gleamed over the fresh turned sod. By broad
                    day-light, the party was ready to continue on its way.</p>
            <p>There were doubts among the members of the company as to whether the ashes of the campfire would
                    successfully conceal the new-made grave from lurking savages. Fears were expressed lest the body
                    might be dug up and mutilated. In an effort to make the place less conspicious, the party drove
                    their wagons over the spot and trampled the ground as much as possible. Then the wagons took up
                    their groaning creak as the patient oxen toiled onward toward the goal of the pioneer family. This
                    is the story of the first grave in the "Upper Indiana Cemetery". The death
                    recorded occurred in 1801 or 1802.</p>
            <p>Mr. Emison located a few miles farther on near Maria Creek. There he built Fort Petticoat, a grist
                    mill and a saw-mill. In after years, this pioneer and the members of his family were buried in the
                    cemetery the location of which had <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-025-3-012"/> been established on that sad
                    night when the spot had been used as a suitable camp-site.</p>
            <p>A certain citizen of the community died shortly after the Civil War and his family wished to bury him
                    in the cemetery beside the church. Immediately there arose a great clamor, because he had been a
                    Confederate soldier. Some were determined that he should not be buried in hallowed ground. Finally,
                    the family was permitted to consign his body to a grave within the cemetery, but when they attempted
                    to place a monument, the trouble broke out afresh. The family was forced to place the gravestone
                    outside the fence. When later, the cemetery was enlarged, this monument was taken into the grounds,
                    and, at present, it stands very near the center of the graveyard. So are differences, aroused by
                    such great conflicts as the Civil War, blotted out by time and the changes that come of necessity.
                    Later generations forget or ignore old hatreds.</p>
            <p>Another' interesting fact, vouched for by those who know, is that Colonel James Paul
                    Badollet lies buried in this old cemetery. He was a graduate of West Point, being a member of the
                    first class. There are veterans of every war that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has ever fought buried in this cemetery, showing that the people of this community have
                    been interested, not alone in their own private affairs, but in the welfare of the nation at large.
                    Living up to their convictions, they have sent forth their sons to champion the Nation in each hour
                    of need.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, contains the statement that the first settlement was made in the spring of

                    that George Dunn was a son of James Dunn. Ezekiel Moore was an early settler as verified by

                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi> The Wa-pe-ke-way Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution was the
                        local organization responsible for marking the site of the first settlement in <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Hendricks County</region>
                        </placeName>. The design first took form in the mind of Mrs. Thomas R. Barker, organizing regent
                        of the Chapter. It was suggested by the national organization that a new chapter be given, when
                        feasible, the name of an individual, place, or event—or of something outstanding in
                        the history of the community in which a chapter should be organized. The history of <placeName>

                        the banks of the Wa-pe-ke-way, the Indian name for "White Salt", or, as it has
                        come down to the present, "White Rock". This beautiful Indian name was decided
                        upon for the local chapter of the D.A.R. The significance of the name created in the mind of
                        Mrs. Barker the desire to locate the site of this first settlement and to mark it appropriately.
                        To this end she appointed a Committee, composed of Mrs. F. M. Harrison, Miss Sadie Cook, Mrs.

            <p>The story has been handed down through the Ramsey family that he came to the unbroken wilderness of
                    what is now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hendricks County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1814. In that year he is said to have pre-empted land near White Lick Creek. Here,
                    according to family tradition, he lived with the Delawares until they departed for the reservations
                    provided for them by Congress, after they had ceded their own lands in Indiana to the Federal
                    Government.</p>

                    </placeName> Ramsey's gravestone which stands on the brow of an elevation above White Lick
                    Creek, is chiseled the statement that he pre-empted his farm in 1814, and that he died in 1825. This
                    information seems to be erroneous. The death date should be 1833, since the abstract of title to the
                    farm establishes the fact that the pioneer's will was made on June 15, 1833, and probated
                    on August 12, 1833. Government records show that no pre-emption filings were made prior to 1820, and
                    the abstract of title indicates that Ramsey purchased the land from Anthony Vernon, its first owner,
                    in 1825. Vernon made an entry for it on November 4, 1822, paying cash.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>A few months ago the following statement came to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> from Bourbon,
                    Indiana. It was written by a young Boy Scout, Howard Hillis, Jr., and indicates an early interest in

                            went to war. The Captain died about 1878 and was buried in an obscure private lot. For
                            nearly fifty years his grave was neglected but in 1926 the Boy Scouts discovered it and

                            inclined, and a few veterans who took part in the Mexican campaign still survive. In 1854,
                            the Bourbon Light Infantry was organized through the exertions of Captain John C. Hedrick, a
                            Mexican War veteran, who voted for Andrew Jackson for President. The articles of association
                            are in the well known handwriting of Capt. Hedrick, on the 13th day of May, 1854. Those who
                            "enlisted" pledged themselves to continue in the
                            "service" for a period of six years unless sooner discharged. Each member
                            was required to uniform himself with a pair of fine boots with red top fronts, white
                            drilling pantaloons, a red sash at least six feet in length, a black or deep blue frock
                            coat, a black stock, black glazed cap, plait and plume. The company was required to meet at
                            Bourbon for drill on the last Saturday of April, May, June, August and September and on the
                            4th of July of every year. It was provided that each officer who should behave in an
                            "unofficer"-like manner while on parade should be fined one dollar and each
                            un-commissioned officer and private who should behave in an unsoldier-like manner while on

            <p>The Boy Scouts found the grave of Captain Hedrick at the southeast corner of a rolling forty-acre
                    tract on which the captain once lived for several years. His home was a log-cabin, which stood until
                    a few years ago. It was located at the northeast corner of his farm. The little Hedrick farm now
                    forms a part of a larger unit owned by Walter S. Baker. The captain's home was a half-mile
                    south and about a half-mile west of Bourbon. It was not on the main road, but was reached by a
                    narrow lane, an open right-of-way, which ran westward from the road almost a half-mile. This little
                    used lane is still open, though an attempt to close it, which resulted in litigation, was made a few
                    years ago.</p>
            <p>The grave of Captain Hedrick is unmarked except by a lilac bush, but a marker erected near the end of
                    1875, or later, indicates that at least two of his children were buried in the lot. There may have
                    been others. The second of the two children whose deaths are indicated on the marker died on
                    September 3, 1875. Evidently the father was still living then as the inscription carries the words,
                    "Sons of J. C. and M. Hedrick." This marker was probably erected by Captain
                    Hedrick. By 1880, the forty-acre tract had come into the possession of another owner. As the Captain
                    probably owned the land to the time of his death, it seems likely that he died at some time between
                    1875 and 1880. The date given to the Boy Scouts, in 1926, by some old resident of Bourbon, is no
                    doubt correct; that is, Captain Hedrick "died about 1878".</p>

            <p>McDonald, the historian of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marshall County</region>
                    </placeName>, says that Hedrick voted for Andrew Jackson for President. If this was in 1832, he was
                    born at least as early at 1810 or 1811. He may have been born earlier, but it is not likely, as the
                    son who died in 1875 was but a babe of nine months. Though a veteran of the Mexican War, there is no
                    certainty that he came out of that service a Captain. It is probable that his military title dates
                    from the time when he was elected Captain of the Bourbon Light Infantry in 1854. He seems not to
                    have seen any service in the Civil War.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    handwriting of Francis appears on various business documents of the company early in the
                    seventeen-sixties. Charles died in 1774,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> leaving the business to his son, then
                    twenty-six years old and already an experienced trader.</p>
            <p>The importance of young Bosseron was still further increased by his marriage to Francoise, the
                    daughter of the later Sieur Joseph Antoine Drouet de Richeville, a man of family and ability, to
                    whom Governor St Ange had entrusted the command of the militia when he was compelled to leave <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> on account of illness. The young Mayor was also appointed guardian of the two minor
                    children of Sieur de Richeville, Margueritte and Antoine, at the request of the widow who wished to
                    marry a second time.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> This fact probably gave rise to the story of the two

                    </placeName> by Colonel Clark can hardly be over-estimated. Father Gibault must have known the
                    Bosseron family for several years prior to this time, both in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. A receipt [dated January, 1777], proves that the churchman sometimes carried small
                    packages from town to town for the merchant [Bosseron] when he was traveling about on his pastoral
                    duties. It is therefore probable that he was relying on his knowledge of the Mayor's
                    friendship for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

            <p>It is certain that Bosseron did become a loyal ally of the new American nation, and that he gave
                    Colonel Clark valuable assistance. He was elected Captain of the militia before Father Gibault left
                    the town and made temporary commander of the fort; and on the 10th of August following, he received
                    the first commission issued by Clark in the west.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The records in the old

                    </placeName> in the summer of 1778 by the American forces.</p>
            <p>When Clark appeared before <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the following February with his handful of men exhausted by hard marching and
                    exposure, and his powder soaked with water, Bosseron was one of the first to offer hospitality to
                    the weary men, and it was the powder and shot which he and a few other loyal Frenchmen had hidden
                    from the British, which Clark used to capture the newly repaired fort and the strong force of
                    Red-Coats in possession of it.</p>
            <p>Here is Clark's own account of the event: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Amunition was scarce with us as most of our stores had been put on the galley; but
                            fortunately at the time of its being reported that the whole of the goods in the town were
                            to be taken for the king's use, Col. Legras, Major Bosseron and others had buried
                            the greatest part of their powder and ball. This was immediately produced and we found
                            ourselves well supplied by those gentlemen.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Bosseron had yet another share in the surrender of the British garrison at this time. When the fort
                    was given up, it was necessary for the Americans to secure immediately the seven boats with supplies
                    and reënforcements which were expected at any minute by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Clark and his men were naturally too weary to set out on such an expedition at once
                    and so he entrusted the important task to Helm, Legras, Bosseron, and a small party of helpers. The
                    men "surrounded and took the whole [group] prisoners without firing a shot." Clark
                    was greatly pleased by this feat as it not only provided much needed supplies for the soldiers and
                    townspeople but put an end to all hopes of relief for the British. He bestowed high praise on the
                    men who performed the exploit.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Bosseron's bills for supplies and his numerous loans were not paid and were
                    rapidly growing into an account of huge proportions for a pioneer merchant to carry. In 1780, <list type="footnotes">

                    to ask for the French merchant's help once more.</p>
            <p>From various sources the Americans had learned that the British were planning a general attack
                    against all the western settlements in order to regain possession of the country they had lost. This
                    made it necessary for Clark to set about building a fort near the mouth of the <geogName>Ohio
                    river</geogName> in order to protect American shipping interests on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> which were constantly threatened by both Spanish and English boats, and, at the same

                    </placeName> settlements.</p>
            <p>Clark had received orders to build such a fort in the secret instructions given him by Governor
                    Patrick Henry at the beginning of the western campaign, but had been unable to carry out the plan
                    earlier because he could not secure men for the undertaking without withdrawing those on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. He knew that any weakening in that locality would invite the British to raid the

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> settlers. Finally, on the 20th of February, he received a letter from Pierre Prevost, a
                    Kaskaskian who was engaged in trade on the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

                    campaigning would be lost. Eight days later he sent the following letter to "Major
                    Bosseron, Esqr., Aux St. Vincent's": <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>In some way Bosseron was able to accomplish the task Clark had given him to perform. He pacified the
                    disaffected volunteers and, although the Continental Congress had not paid his other bills, found
                    the means to provision the garrison again.</p>
            <p>Clark was now free to build the much needed fort, which was named Fort Jefferson at Red Banks, on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, five miles south of the mouth of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. The work was
                    begun in April and progressed so rapidly that in May, when word came that the British forces were
                    marching toward Cahokia, Clark was able to leave the new Fort. He succeeded in reaching Cahokia
                    twenty-four hours before the attack began. When the British discovered that the town had been
                    reinforced by the leader whom they feared most of all, they made a half-hearted attack but soon
                    withdrew to <placeName>

                    defeat of the enemy at this time, but "the most potent reason for the precipitate retreat
                    and the total defeat of the objects hoped for by the British officials was the opportune appearance

            <p>The latter part of Bosseron's career seems to have been full of financial losses and other
                    misfortunes. With Clark he was accused of plotting against Spanish subjects in Natchez, but the
                    charges were dismissed when it was shown that he acted only under the orders of the General. When
                    the French judges of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> country were accused of land frauds, Bosseron was one of those indicted. The men
                    pleaded that they had intended no wrong but had followed the old French customs which permitted such
                    officials to assign lands. The judges were not punished but the titles to such lands were declared
                    void and many citizens of <placeName>

                    </placeName> lost property which they had obtained in good faith.</p>
            <p>Sadder still, the solemn promises of Clark that whatever debts Bosseron should contract would be
                    paid, "if the credit of the State is sufficient", were not fulfilled. In the
                    Account Book may be found a memorandum of a part of the letters of exchange which Bosseron had

            <p>"Bill of Exchange No. 9" seems to have been that given to Bosseron to pay for the
                    supplies provided for Captain Helm during the fall of <hi rend="b">1778</hi>, which is recorded in

                        <p>The Commissioners can by no means depart from the principle that the State is not obliged to

                    excerpts prove to have been due to him, we have no means of knowing, but we have proof that in 1784
                    he sold more than half of these warrants for a third of their value. This was possibly due in part
                    to the fact that General Clark, who had guaranted the payment of his claims, was removed from
                    command in July, 1783, and was himself compelled to make the long journey to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to beg the Governor for money to pay for necessary food and clothing. Moreover the
                    paper money which the French had been compelled to receive from the Americans was practically
                    worthless at this time and most of the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> were greatly impoverished. Fearing that he would lose what was left of his small
                    capital, Bosseron sold his warrants for what he could get.</p>
            <p>The original bill of sale signed by Bosseron proves that at this time he exchanged at a great
                    sacrifice the sum of three thousand pounds in warrants for one thousand pounds in specie, a loss of
                    ten thousand hard-earned dollars—because of his loyalty to the country of his adoption.

            <p>Bosseron died in 1791, at the early age of forty-three, bankrupt and, according to a tradition in the
                    family, disillusioned. An effort was made later to have officials of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> reconsider the findings of the Commissioners in regard to his warrants for the benefit
                    of his family but without success. He left six daughters and one son but as the oldest was only
                    seventeen at the time of the father's death, patriotic deeds of the parent were soon
                    forgotten. Today, we are told, there is no one of his family living in the old town which he helped
                    to make famous.</p>
            <p>Historians, too, have given scant honor to Francis Bosseron and his name is often omitted from the
                    list of those who were most helpful to Clark. This, we believe, is because his story has never been
                    well known. For, according to Clark's own testimony [quoted above], he rendered most
                    valuable service both in the capture and holding of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the Americans, in 1778-1779, and he made it possible for Clark to protect the posts

            <p>The Bosseron Account Book, printed below in the original French and in translation, owes its
                    importance to the fact that it was kept by Francis Bosseron, a pioneer merchant and the Mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at intervals during the period from September, 1777, until January, 1782, while the
                    forces of the British and Americans were struggling for possession of the town. It is the longest
                    manuscript in the so-called Lasselle Collection of business and family papers, newspaper files,
                    etc., belonging to the Lasselle and Bosseron families in pioneer times, which were gathered together
                    by the late Charles Bosseron Lasselle, a grandson of Mayor Bosseron. The Collection was acquired by
                    the Indiana State Library in 1908.</p>
            <p>The chief value of the old Account Book lies naturally in the first-hand information it furnishes of
                    conditions in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> when the town was captured by the Americans, and the proofs it affords of the valuable
                    assistance given to George Rogers Clark by Mayor Bosseron, timely and necessary aid that has never
                    been generally recognized.</p>
            <p>It is a very human document for it possesses the unique interest of revealing, often from day to day,
                    the purposes and occupations of various people who are at present in the limelight of history. With
                    the help of a very little imagination, the student of the entries may see Captain Helm arriving in
                    the town with almost no money and not long after, September 25th, beginning to requisition supplies
                    for the garrison and comforts of various kinds for himself from the hospitable Mayor. All through
                    the fall he is shown making friends with the neighboring tribes of Indians—with
                    "Tobacco and his band", "the chief of the Pians", "the
                    Loup chief", "the Ouyatanons", "the Outasias",
                    "the Souteux", "the Coux savages", etc.—doubtless
                    preparing the way for Colonel Clark to make treaties when he was free to leave the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country.</p>
            <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-025-3-029"/>
            <p>In the same record may be found the facts in regard to the purchase of the historic flag of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its maker, Madame Goderre, the "Betsey Ross of the West". It is
                    shown here to have been a red and green pennant [<hi rend="i">pavilion</hi>] or company banner,
                    presumably prepared for the volunteer company of which Mayor Bosseron was captain.</p>
            <p>On December 17th, 1778, the day when the British army was reported to be "not three miles
                    distant", the dauntless American obtained from his friend Bosseron, 241 pounds of beef and
                    150 pounds of powder, apparently in a last desperate effort to hold the fort against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his army of Indians and Red Coats.</p>
            <p>The Account Book is also of interest for the insight it gives into French pioneer book-keeping. All
                    accounts are naturally recorded in French <hi rend="i">livres, sous</hi> [or <hi rend="i">sols</hi>], and <hi rend="i">deniers.</hi> The sign of the <hi rend="i">livre</hi> resembles a
                    ditto mark. Spanish <hi rend="i">piastres</hi> and American dollars are also current coins and have
                    the same value [five <hi rend="i">livres.</hi>] Individual accounts are usually labelled as due in
                    pelts or <hi rend="i">livres</hi>, 12 <hi rend="i">livres</hi> in pelts being equal to 10 in specie
                    in some of the business transactions recorded in Bosseron's various papers.</p>
            <p>The text of the manuscript is reproduced here with as much accuracy as possible. The original is a
                    thin ledger-shaped pamphlet, consisting of perhaps thirty pages, sewed together by hand and provided
                    with a cover of brown wrapping paper. It is not possible to indicate the faded ink, the careless
                    penmanship, the illegible and scratched out entries, the worn pages, etc. Capitals are scattered
                    about with little regard for rule or uniformity. The spelling is, in many places, confusingly
                    phonetic and often varies from line to line in other ways. However, in spite of all these confusing
                    conditions, the book is surprisingly clear as a whole, and Bosseron shows himself to have been in
                    many ways, a man of ability and one of much better education than most of the people of the time.</p>
            <p>The account book contains five records which are all more or less distinct:<list type="ordered">

                        with the period immediately following the departure of the English when bills of various kinds
                        had been settled with the townspeople. The cargoes of the British boats captured by the
                        Americans, were also divided among the soldiers and Creoles and add d to the unusual prosperity.
                        The first fourteen pages of the Account Book evidently served as Bosseron's day book.
                        The records in the back of the book are tabulations copied from some notes. These are not

            <p>[Miss Shaw has been long interested in the services of Francis Bosseron to the American cause in the
                    West during the Revolutionary War. She has labored with the papers in the Lasselle collection in the
                    Indiana State Library for the past two years, and now presents the Account Book in the original
                    French and in translation, believing that all who are interested in the history of the Old Northwest
                    will gather from the document the importance of the aid extended to Clark by

                                other nine were evidently for social occasions usually shared with his friend Brouillet.</p>

                            Book. As the two records are almost identical, it has not seemed necessary to print both.
                            The form given here is that of the second bill as the spelling seems somewhat clearer in
                            places.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">50</hi> The meaning of <hi rend="i">mitasse</hi> is not clear. It is
                            possibly the phonetic spelling for <hi rend="i">mitraillea.</hi> The French Dictionary by
                            Clifton, Grimeaux, &amp; McLaughlin derives this word from <hi rend="i">mitaille</hi>,
                            O.F. From <hi rend="i">mite</hi>, meaning a small coin. <hi rend="i">Mitasse</hi> seems more
                            likely to be contraction of <hi rend="i">demi tasse.</hi>

                            <hi rend="i">Vinde</hi> is colloquial for <hi rend="i">vin doux</hi>, sweet wine.</item>

                     <hi rend="sup">52</hi> The items listed on November 12th are of general interest as they
                            give all the facts available concerning the red and green flag raised by Madam Goderre,
                            which is often confused with the American flag raised over Fort Sackville by Father Gibault.
                            It should be noticed that Bosseron calls this <hi rend="i">Le pavilion</hi>, the pennant, or
                            company banner. A national flag is called a <hi rend="i">drapeau.</hi> It was probably not
                            made until late in the fall as It was not paid for until November.</item>

                            order upon General Clark mentioned here. There are two discrepancies. The date given here is
                            January 14, 1779, and that given in the discussion of Bill of Exchange No. 9 is November 19,
                            1779. The amounts differ somewhat also. Bill of Exchange No. 9 is for 1067 dollars; the
                            amount due here is 5710 livres and five sous, or $942.05. On the other hand, this
                            is the only certified account of which we know Bosseron sent to the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                            </placeName> House of Delegates. It is certain that no money was available for paying
                            Clark's bills in 1779. It is quite probable that Bosseron was called on to provide
                            additional supplies for the garrison during 1779, and that these were added to the earlier
                            account.</item>

            <head>A Letter of 1832</head>
            <p>[The following letter was written by Martha Fussell the wife of Soloman Fussell very soon after they
                    arrived at the home of John Lewis in 1832. Lewis was a pioneer already established on a frontier
                    farm near Pendleton, Indiana. The letter was mailed to the father and mother of Solomon Fussell back
                    in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Chester County</region>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, and was designed for them and other relatives and
                    friends from whom Martha and her husband had recently parted. Solomon and Martha Fussell were the
                    great-grandparents of Charles Swain Thomas. Henry Lewis in whose cabin home they were entertained
                    was the grandfather of Miss Evangeline E. Lewis, of the Pendleton and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township Public Library, and the little Joe spoken of in the letter was her father,
                    then but two years old. The father and mother of Solomon Fussell to whom the letter was written were
                    the great-grandparents of Miss Lewis. The <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> is indebted to Miss Lewis for
                    the letter, who sent it with the information presented in this foreword to Pres. W. L. Bryan of
                    Indiana University. The letter was printed in the <hi rend="i">Pendleton Times</hi> on March 22,
                        1923.—<hi rend="i">Editor.</hi>]</p>

                        <salute>Dear Relatives and Friends:</salute>
                        <p>Knowing you feel an interest in our well doing, I hasten to write to inform you of
                                    safe arrival at our place of destination in good health and spirits, meeting with
                                    nothing to disturb our journey since writing at Fail-View.</p>
                        <p>We have had as pleasant weather as we could have wished and the roads are as good as
                                    could reasonably be expected. We got to Jonathan Justice's late Firstday
                                    [Sunday] and received a hearty welcome by them. They appear to be a very worthy
                                    family, who came to this country when it was quite a wilderness under far more
                                    discouragements than any of us could possibly have thought we could have endured.
                                    But through industry and faithful reliance on that Hand which never misleads those
                                    who ask for aid, they have become independent though not austere and hard hearted,
                                    nor do they think that all who do not get along as well as they have deserved no
                                    mercy or assistance, and they seem wiling to extend of charity to all that need it.
                                    We left them on Secondday and got here at John Lewis's on Fourthday and
                                    found them all well and very comfortably settled on their own land in a cabin where
                                    we all are with them. They are in good spirits, and I see no reasons why they should
                                    be otherwise, as the prospect before them in our opinion is promising and sincerely
                                    as [do] I wish we could meet with as good bargain as they have. <pb n="243" id="VAA4025-025-3-059"/> It is in truth a beautiful situation, directly on the
                                    State road and the land more like a mole hill than you ever saw. You cannot form an
                                    idea of the quality of the soil without seeing for yourselves. We do not feel any
                                    ways discouraged except in land having risen in price so much since Solomon was out
                                    last fall. Then would have been the time for him to have had the best chance of
                                    buying.</p>
                        <p>John Lewis has been offered $200 for 40 acres of his and would not accept
                                    this offer knowing that it will represent a thrible interest.</p>
                        <p>11th Month, 4th</p>
                        <p>Solomon has been looking at several places that are for sale but has not concluded to
                                    take any one yet until he looks more around the country. So far we are much pleased
                                    with this place. It is quite thickly settled and with some very respectable people.
                                    There have been ten of the neighbors in to see us today, two very fine old Friends,
                                    William Williams and Daniel Nicholson. D. Nicholson's daughter was here
                                    when we got here. She is a very nice looking girl. There are several families of
                                    Friends near Huntsville, though no meeting established yet. Joseph Cadwalleder had a
                                    meeting there this day two weeks ago to the general satisfication of all parties.</p>
                        <p>I will now give you some account of our expenses, which amounted in all to
                                    eighty-five dollars and fifteen cents; ten dollars toll on the turnpike near four
                                    hundred miles, and most part of as beautiful road as you ever saw. The
                                    doctor's bill and extra expenses on Priscilla's [afterwards
                                    Priscilla M. Thomas, who was very sick during the journey] account twelve dollars;
                                    and two bushels of oats and corn for horsefeed which averaged about thirty-one cents
                                    a bushel. Corn sells here from twenty to twenty-five cents, wheat sixty to
                                    seventy-five cents, potatoes sixteen cents a bushel, butter eight cents, cabbage two
                                    dollars per hundred, eggs six cents, beef, hind quarter, two and one-half cents a
                                    pound, fore quarter, two cents; tallow, six cents; pork one and one-half cents.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the stagnation of business on account of the vetoe [Jackson's veto
                                    of the Bank Bill July 10, 1832] and cholera at <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, there has been no sale of hogs this season. Wages a day for a man
                                    thirty-seven and one-half cents, and fifty in summer and dried apples seventy-five
                                    cents a bushel. We got a few things for housekeeping at a little town between here
                                    and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                                    </placeName> at the following prices: coffee-pot fifty cents; one half dozen large
                                    plates forty-three cents; small plates thirty-one cents; cream jug twenty-five
                                    cents; two pint bowls (Liverpool ware) thirty-seven cents; <placeName>

                                    </placeName> pepper box six cents; one half dozen knives (very handsome)
                                    seventy-five cents. Hallow ware sells here at four cents per pound; wool
                                    thirty-seven and one-half cents already carded, leather, good Spanish hide, sells at
                                    twenty-eight cents; buckwheat at thirty-seven and one-half cents and good shirting
                                    muslin at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                                    </placeName> thirty-seven and one-half cents; I do not know the price here as I have
                                    had no chance of knowing. Bureaus are twelve dollars with glass mountings, splint
                                    bottom chairs thirty-seven and one-half cents apiece, brick twenty-five cents per
                                    hundred, very good tea one dollar per pound; coffee six pounds for one dollar, salt
                                    fifty pounds for one dollar, earthen ware is <pb n="244" id="VAA4025-025-3-060"/>
                                    the dearest article that there is, on account of not having a pottery near here that
                                    is carried on as it should be. There is excellent clay here for the purpose and wood
                                    for the cutting. The oracle of the West, Jonathan Justice says,—Anyone
                                    that understands the business would in a few years monopolize the whole trade, and
                                    realize an independent fortune. I do regret that sister Mary was unwilling to let
                                    her boys have the chance.</p>
                        <p>Please tell Thomas Jacobs that the papers have not come to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, and I wish him to write to J. Painter and tell him to direct to
                                    Pendleton post office. I do think Uncle Tommy would be delighted with this place, it
                                    is such a wonderful place for trade and business of all sorts. You may think that we
                                    are out of the world but we seem to have just got into it. I believe we see from
                                    fifty to sixty people passing and repassing daily, on horseback, in wagons and
                                    sleds, within sixteen yards of the door. It is now not eleven o'clock and
                                    Sarah has counted forty-six already.</p>
                        <p>The place Solomon seems most pleased with is situated one and one half miles from
                                    here. It has a spring sufficient to water the whole place from end to end, and lies
                                    directly on what we call the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Knightstown</settlement>
                                    </placeName> road leading from the State road to the National road. There is great
                                    want of a good blacksmith here as there is none here that carries on the trade very
                                    briskly. I do not see anything to prevent people from doing well if they have their
                                    health and are industrious but it will require both and some privations, though
                                    nothing to what many have to encounter in older settled places. It is surprising to
                                    see the number that are coming to this settlement and the increase in the price of
                                    land. If any of our friends have a disposition to possess land here they had better
                                    do so soon. It will indeed be an increasing fund for themselves and their children.
                                    Please tell Brother Charles [Moore] that we wish he would forward the Courier to
                                    Pendleton as it would seem like something from home. We often, very often, think of
                                    you and it seems almost a mistaken idea that we are 600 miles apart when the heart
                                    is so often with you through the day.</p>
                        <p>To convince Aunt Nancy that Rebecca is not deprived of all the comforts of life I
                                    will tell her I have just got up from dinner consisting of good roast pork,
                                    potatoes, turnips, stewed apples, stewed pumpkin, wheat bread, buckwheat cakes, and
                                    butter and a good cup of tea. She is as comfortably fixed as anybody could be in the
                                    same length of time. She has a sweet little, fat black headed baby, as good as she
                                    could ask and little Joe is quite well and so are all of our children at present.</p>
                        <p>Solomon and John have just returned from the election. They were allowed the
                                    privilege of voting greatly to their satisfaction. Solomon has had several very good
                                    offers. If we had money we would get improved land but that has got almost beyond
                                    our reach. Should Joshua conclude to come out this winter I would be much obliged to
                                    him if he could call at a tavern in Mt. Sterling seven and one-half miles west of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Zanesville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> on the National Road (The man's name is Weingardener) and ask
                                    for a small bag containing various articles left there by us. Describe the wagon and
                                    no doubt they will remember it for it was much admired by them. I have written to
                                    Brother Richard today and Solomon is so engaged in land hunting that he has not had
                                    time to write to anyone and <pb n="245" id="VAA4025-025-3-061"/> we wish you to send
                                    this around to all that are near, and write what you would consider would be
                                    interesting to the rest at a distance, and do please write soon. We are wishing much
                                    to hear from you all. Please give our love to all of our friends. Tell Peter we got
                                    plenty of his old fare, chicken and short cake and often wished he was along to help
                                    partake of it.</p>
                        <p>I am afraid you will be hard set to read this for I have made so many mistakes that I
                                    am ashamed of it but we have but one apartment and all the children are talking
                                    around and asking questions. There is no talk of cholera in these parts and the
                                    country is remarkably healthy this season.</p>
                        <p>The roads are so good and likely to be better that we begin to anticipate the
                                    pleasure of seeing Father out here sometime if his health continues which I hope it
                                    may. It is getting [along] in the morning so with more love for Father and Mother
                                    and all the rest than can be expressed I close. John and Rebecca send their love to
                                    all as if mentioned. R. says I. may say she is not sick now. John says she has
                                    mended very much since we came. I must conclude or I shall not have paper enough to
                                    fold this up. We will write again when we have got settled which I hope will be

               <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era: The Revolution after Lincoln.</hi> By CLAUDE G. BOWEES. Houghton
                    Mifflin Company, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>

            <p>Books on special periods of American party history have come rapidly from the pen of Mr. Bowers in
                    recent years. First, <hi rend="i">Party Battles of the Jackson Period</hi> (1922), then, <hi rend="i">Jefferson and <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1925), and now <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era.</hi> Of his purpose in writing
                    the new volume, the author says: "I have sought to recreate the black and bloody drama of
                    these years [1865-1877], to show the leaders of the fighting factions at close range, to picture the
                    moving masses, both whites and blacks, in North and South, surging crazily under the influence of
                    the poisonous propaganda on which they were fed." He sticks to his purpose and performs his
                    task with spirit and evident enjoyment. Events stand out with dramatic clearness, and characters are
                    made to live before their readers.</p>
            <p>The narrative starts with the death of Lincoln and the. accession of Johnson in a chapter headed,
                    "The King is Dead; Long Live the King." The story closes with the Hayes-Tilden
                    election dispute and the end of the carpet-bag régime. The last chapter is entitled,
                    "The Crowning Crime—and Release." The entire volume is writtten in a
                    "style that haunts". The reader is given many a chance to look behind the scenes.
                    Some men are painted blacker than ever before, and perhaps some, like Andrew Johnson, whiter. The
                    stirring scenes and dramatic episodes of the period are seized on and presented with force and
                    skill. Opinions are freely expressed. Of the congressional campaign of 1866, Bowers says:
                    "The Johnsonians … sought through serious constitutional arguments to reach the
                    minds of the voters; the Radicals were concerned solely with their passions." Of Senator
                    Oliver P. Morton, he writes: "He wanted nothing on his sword but blood, and that he seldom
                    failed to draw. In his more savage moments—and he was never gentle—he had no
                    patience with the sword—he grasped a battle-axe." Again: "The election
                    of 1872 was a sweeping triumph for reaction; and the South <pb n="247" id="VAA4025-025-3-063"/>
                    found itself in more dire straits than ever, as the corruptionists and carpetbaggers, triumphant,
                    mounted and rode."</p>
            <p>An unprejudiced reader of the pages of Bowers must agree with most of his conclusions. His
                    interpretations of the party activities of the period are, in the main correct. He deserves credit
                    for his courage in setting forth the ugly truth. He should be praised, likewise, for looking into
                    many and scattered sources for information. In short, he comes close to being an able historian. He
                    is safe enough for critical and widely-read students of history, who are themselves accustomed to
                    handling the sources. These can gather the facts from his narrative, guard themselves against the
                    persuasive influence of his rhetoric, and modify his conclusions when it seems necessary. At the
                    same time, they can not escape the conviction that a more restrained style, more <hi rend="i">pro</hi> and <hi rend="i">con</hi> in the discussion of problems and men, and fewer unqualified
                    opinions would vastly improve the works of this near-brilliant author.</p>
            <p>It may be argued that Mr. Bowers does not write for the sake of trained historical students, but for
                    a vastly larger class of People who have not been in the habit of reading history The answer is that
                    it is these very readers who have no protection against writers of the school of Mr. Bowers. They
                    are not critical. They have little knowledge of the sources. They do not distinguish between fact
                    and fiction. They read what appeals to them. They read for enjoyment and the information acquired is
                    incidental. No period, not even the "Tragic Era" is altogether one of thrills.
                    Even drama is not made up of climaxes in rapid succession. Most actors on the stage of history are
                    gray, rather than black or white. In an era of excitement, selfishness and corruption, there are
                    always some extenuating circumstances. Much that was unsavory in the politics of the period
                    following the Civil War was perfectly natural. The currents of the time ran true to form, as they
                    tend to do in every country, under similar conditions, without reference to what parties or leaders
                    may be in the ascendency. All three of the volumes of Mr. Bowers would be much sounder, live longer
                    and do less harm, had he understood that it is not so much the business of the historian to blame
                    and praise, as to explain political leaders. Neither is it the chief business of the historian to
                    drive his own interpretations into the <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-025-3-064"/> minds of his readers
                    with the most forceful English that he can command, but instead to present the truth clearly leaving
                    his readers free to form their own conclusions in the presence of the evidence impartially stated.
                    Within these limits, an engaging style should not be despised but welcomed.</p>
            <p>The Literary Guild of America has chosen <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> for distribution to its
                    members, as one of twelve books selected for the present year. This is a tribute to the powers of
                    Mr. Bowers as a writer in the field of political history which can not be ignored. An earlier
                    selection of the Guild was Woodward's <hi rend="i">Meet General Grant.</hi> The choice of

                    </placeName> Doren and his associates carries a heavy responsibility. It seems to imply that these
                    intellectual leaders, who have assumed the task of educating the tastes of cultivated readers,
                    prefer books in the field of history that have high literary quality. They must of course,
                    understand the desirability of unbiased accounts, balanced narratives, and presentations of truth
                    for its own sake, but evidently these seemingly indispensible qualities of historical writing have
                    been considered as secondary.</p>

                    </placeName>, by Curtis G. Shake of that city. Johnston was a Virginian who came to <placeName>

                    and in the sub-title of his article, Mr. Shake characterizes Johnston as "An Early Opponent
                    of Slavery". Between 1793 and 1833, when he died, Johnston filled various public offices,
                    among them that of Treasurer of Indiana Territory and Judge of the Circuit Court of his district. In

            <p rend="center">MORE LIGHT ON PRESIDENT HOOVER's ANCESTRY</p>
            <p>[The title of the first article reviewed by Mrs. Clarke is, "Origin of the Hoover Families";
                    of the second, "Hoover American Ancestry". For these articles see the <hi rend="i">National Genealogical Quarterly</hi>, XVII, 1-8 (March, 1929). See also the, XXIV, 223-241
                    (December, 1928), for Mrs. Clarke's paper, "Andrew Hoover comes to
                    Indiana". In her study, which antedates that of Mr. Staudt by several weeks, Mrs. Clarke
                    presents the correct Andreas Huber. From documents, preserved by the Indiana descendants of Andreas,
                    she furnishes some facts about the American career of the President's ancestor not included
                    in Mr. Staudt's article. Like President Hoover, Mrs. Clarke is a descendant of the Andreas
                    Huber who reached America in 1738.—<hi rend="i">Editor.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Two interesting articles on Hoover ancestry appear in the <hi rend="i">National Genealogical Society
                        Quarterly</hi> for March, 1929, one by Richard N. Staudt of Buenos Aires, a member of the
                    Society and a collateral descendant of the Andreas Huber who landed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1741, and the other by Major Calvin Kephart, president of the Genealogical Society,
                    the latter paper being a sort of sequel to Mr. Staudt's contribution. No very startling
                    facts are disclosed in these articles, the most important new point established being that the
                    Andreas Huber who was President Hoover's ancestor did not come from Baden-Baden after all,
                    but from the town of Ellerstadt in the Swiss Palatinate, a village belonging to the County of
                    Wartenberg which a few years later became a part of the Margraviate of Baden. It is supposed that
                    when Andreas went back on a visit (if he did) or when he wrote asking for a birth of christening
                    certificate, whatever documents were made out for him were made out by the Baden authorities. Hence
                    the supposition that his home was Baden. In like manner, the fact that he sailed from Rotterdam
                    doubtless gave rise to the rumor that he was of Dutch origin.</p>
            <p>Mr. Staudt depends largely in his narrative on the findings of H. F. Macco, one of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>'s most eminent genealogists, who at first believed that President
                    Hoover's ancestor was the Andreas Huber who came over in 1741. The pains and patience
                    necessary to establish genealogical data are sometimes almost infinite and one is filled with
                    wonder, admiration and gratitude at the results. The reward must often lie solely in the
                    satisfication there is in finding out the truth. In these investigations no slightest link is
                    unimportant, and nothing is taken for granted that is capable of proof. When word reached <pb n="251" id="VAA4025-025-3-067"/> Mr. Macco that the Andreas Huber who was the ancestor of our
                    President came to this country before 1740 he did not stop until he had run down any number of Huber
                    lines to which this Andreas did <hi rend="i">not</hi> belong, and his findings must prove of great
                    interest and value to these other Hubers.</p>
            <p>The fact that <hi rend="i">the</hi> Andreas landed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> on September 9, 1738, at the age of fifteen years, is verified. It is also proved that
                    he was born at Ellerstadt, in the district of Durkheim, in the Palatinate, that he was the son of
                    Jonas Huber and his wife Maria, and that he was christened on January 29, 1723, the entry being
                    found in the church-book of the Lutheran parish of Ellerstadt. His father, Jonas, died in Ellerstadt
                    April 13, 1741, aged 73, within two years after Andreas' departure for America; so we know
                    that the lad who came unaccompanied by any member of his family left at least one parent behind, and
                    the fact that he named his oldest son Jonas proves that he thought fondly of him. Jonas the father
                    of Andreas was the son of Johan Heinrich Huber, a citizen and linen-weaver of Oberkulm, in the
                    county of Lenzburg in the Swiss canton of Aargau. Herr Macco has even found the very spot on which
                    Andreas Huber was born, by looking up the estate-register, and that, as late as 1790, the house was
                    still in possession of the family, its then owner being Joh. Philip Huber, a nephew of Andreas and
                    grandson of Jonas.</p>
            <p>When he began his researches Mr. Staudt, like Macco, believed that Herbert Hoover was descended from
                    the Andreas who arrived here in 1741 at the age of 20, and settled in what is now <placeName>

                    rises from humble circumstances to greatness, is always of general public interest."</p>

            <head>Comment and News</head>
            <p>The Executive Committee of the Indiana Historical Society deserves to be highly commended for the
                    campaign recently launched to increase the membership of the organization. Out of the population of
                    the entire State, it seems unbelievable that only about a thousand are sufficiently interested in
                    the purposes of the Society and in its publications to pay the nominal membership dues each year.
                    The <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> believes that, instead of one thousand, there are easily ten thousand
                    persons in Indiana who would gladly pay the annual fee of $2.00, if better acquainted
                    with the activities and aims of the Society. He feels certain that ten thousand citizens of the
                    State could be found who would willingly sustain the work of the Society, even if not readers of the
                        <hi rend="i">Bulletins</hi> of the Indiana Historical Bureau and the quarterly issues of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi> The members of the Executive Committee of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Historical Society</hi> are not super-salesmen. They would not use the methods
                    of super-salesmen if they could. Rightly they prefer that members of the Society shall join of their
                    own free will, because they wish to take part in the activities of the Society and because they
                    enjoy reading the publications furnished to all members. Much can be done to further the interests
                    of the Society by present members. Readers of this issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> are
                    respectfully urged to aid the Executive Committee of the Historical Society in the laudable effort
                    to obtain new members who will be active workers and who will become interested readers of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> and other publications.</p>
            <p>In his "Invitation to Membership" in the Indiana Historical Society which was sent
                    out in August, Mr. Lee Burns, Chairman of the Executive Committee, pointed out that the organization
                    was formed on December 11, 1830. He closed his appeal with these appropriate words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In 1930 the Society will have completed a century of important, valuable service to the
                            State. We invite everyone who is interested in the history of the state and in preserving
                            its important landmarks and forwarding its finer traditions to join the Society and take
                            part in our Centennial Celebration in December, 1930.</p>

            <p>With the next issue, the will have completed a quarter century of existence. Within the twenty-five
                    volumes, it is possible to find a considerable number of carefully prepared papers pertaining to
                    important events and characters vitally related to the history of Indiana. Documentary material of
                    value has been printed from time to time. Certain early issues have become very scarce, but there
                    are several complete files in the State that are accessible to all historical investigators and also
                    a number of such files outside in various libraries of the country. It is very desirable that a
                    comprehensive index covering all the volumes to the end of the present year shall be published. It
                    is the hope of the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> that such an index may be prepared and furnished to
                    subscribers. The project will certainly be undertaken if the problem of the modest cost of the
                    venture can be solved.</p>
            <p>In the last number of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> had the boldness
                    to declare that he would like to announce an offer of fifty dollars for the best article on some
                    phase of Indiana history, with a second fifty dollars to be distributed equally among five of those
                    who should submit other papers suitable for publication. The mails have not been flooded with
                    letters from generous readers concerning this proposed competition. Sadly must it be reported that
                    not a single communication regarding the desired $100 has come in. An appeal for
                    $1000 would have met with a response fully as prompt! Possibly, the reaction to a plea
                    for the larger sum would have been more effective. We live under conditions when small things are
                    despised. The promoters of drives go after colossal sums, To accomplish certain ends, hundreds of
                    thousands of dollars are now thought essential where thousands, or even hundreds, of dollars would
                    have been deemed ample but a few years ago. To a large degree, there is no rational justification
                    for this condition. It is a fashion of the times. The <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> will stand by his
                    proposal. He wants $100 and no more for the purpose mentioned. If nine readers will
                    subscribe ten dollars each, he will add the final ten necessary to round out the coveted sum. Watch
                    for the report in the December number.</p>
            <p>There is evidence on every hand that book-readers are turning more and more to history and biography.
                    This is largely due to the fact that a new class of writers have invaded <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-025-3-070"/> the field. Volumes of a kind that sell are being written. They not only
                    sell but they are widely read and enjoyed. There is not so much in the books from the prolific pens
                    of the present popular producers that is new, but being written in appealing language by authors who
                    have a keen scent for the dramatic and a graphic power of description, they are read by a host of
                    people who have hitherto cared little for history. Not familiar with the works of trained historical
                    workers, the hosts of new readers have fallen readily into the erroneous view that the authors whose
                    works they follow with appreciation have done an unusual amount of research and have found extensive
                    sources of information unknown to well-meaning but wooden-headed college professors. The plain facts
                    are that the new school of successful writers have done far less careful research, that their
                    narratives are less sane and not as well balanced, and that the sources used, with rare exceptions,
                    are well known to students of history who have been on the firing-line for years. The new writers,
                    as well as the new readers, have deceived themselves in regard to the extent of their investigations
                    and the originality of their disclosures. Two things the new writers have accomplished. They have
                    found readers, and they have forced more scholarly investigators to give greater attention to the
                    presentation of their findings for which everyone should give thanks.</p>
            <p>High-powered advertising on the part of publishers is partly responsible for the wide sale of the new
                    histories and biographies and to a great extent for the mistaken notions that have come to prevail
                    in the minds of readers. Possible purchasers of books receive letters daily from responsible
                    publishers praising the volumes of the later entrants in the field of historical writing in most
                    intriguing fashion. Many of the choice passages used in the advertising of the fascinating
                    historical works that are "going over big" read as if written by the same highly
                    trained and gifted composers who prepare the encomiums that lead men to buy the various brands of
                    shaving-cream.</p>

                        <region type="county">DeKalb County</region>
                    </placeName> for about twenty years, when they appeared in a local paper, having come to the County
                    when seventeen years of age. He did not depend on his own memory alone, but obtained and
                    incorporated in his narrative accounts by several of the original settlers. The <hi rend="i">Sketches</hi> reveal very clearly that the severe winters of northeastern Indiana added
                    materially to the problems of pioneering in that part of the State.</p>
            <p>In a short address before the Tenth Annual Conference of Indiana History on December 7, 1928, the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> made a plea for reminiscent sketches by Hoosiers who lived through the
                    period from 1865 to 1900. This was a period of transition of great interest and importance. Those
                    who arrived at maturity near the beginning of this period are now approaching old age. They must
                    write soon or never, as the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> then stated. In this connection, he declared:
                    "I shall be glad to confer with any politician, journalist, lawyer, doctor, educator,
                    minister, farmer, merchant, or ex-saloonkeeper who can tell an interesting story of what he learned
                    by experience in the half century folowing 1865." At the present moment, the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> wishes to stress the importance of what, he said last December, and appeal again
                    for papers from competent writers who have acquired valuable historical knowledge through
                    experience.</p>
            <p>Mr. George S. Cottman whose sketch of the career of John Mahoney as a sculptor appears in this issue
                    is well known to all of the faithful workers in the field of Indiana history. For some years, he was
                    the mainstay of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> In the first <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-025-3-072"/>
                    number following his period as editor, this deserved tribute was paid to him: "With this

                    all persons interested in the study of our State's history are under a deep debt of
                    gratitude, for the self-sacrificing devotion with which, for more than eight years, he almost
                    single-handed carried on this enterprize." Anything from his pen is welcome.</p>
