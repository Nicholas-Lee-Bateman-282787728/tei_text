                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag, with the
                    value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All split
                    lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for the
                    final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>
                <p>The footnote on p.15 has been reformatted as an endnote.</p>

                            imports, but sanity.... When life is true to the poles of nature, the
                            streams of truth will roll through us in song.... In good society, nay,
                            among the angels in heaven, is not everything spoken in fine parable,
                            and not so servilely as it befell to the sense?....</p>
                        <p>The solid men complain that the idealist leaves out the fundamental
                            facts; the poet complains that the solid men leave out the sky. To every
                            plant there are two powers; one shoots down as rootlet, and one upward
                            as tree. You must have eyes of science to see in the seed its nodes; you
                            must have the vivacity of the poet to perceive in the thought its
                            futurities.â</p>
