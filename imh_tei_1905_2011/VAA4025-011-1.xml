            <p>Indiana was once a colony of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government as truly as the old thirteen colonies were ever colonies of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. While the colonial status disappeared politically in 1816, economically and socially a
                    colonial condition prevailed almost, if not quite, to the Civil War. The population at the time of
                    admission, according to the territorial census of 1815, was but 63,897, and the regions occupied
                    were those bordering on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and the lower <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and lying in or adjacent to the Whitewater Valley.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> By far the
                    greater part of the new state was yet to be reclaimed from the Indians and colonized by settlers
                    from older States and foreign countries. In 1840, there still remained in Indiana, 4,396,494 acres
                    of unsold land belonging to the Federal government.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Certainly there was nothing
                    more important in the history of the State than the process of colonization which continued till the

                    Indeed, it was then true and for some years longer, that many parts of the State were in a frontier
                    condition.</p>
            <p>In the period under consideration, Indiana, along with other western communities in a similar stage
                    of development, was a veritable "melting pot." Into it came colonists from widely
                    separated parts of the older portion of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and from western Europe.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Out of these diverse elements, with
                    their different customs, traits of character, and ideals, there was built up a new society. The heat
                    produced by the contact and conflict of different elements of the incoming colonists with each
                    other, and of all elements with their physical environment, was not sufficient to reduce all customs
                    and institutions carried in to a fluid condition. The resulting social structure was not, therefore,
                    homogeneous, but to a considerable degree conglomerate. In our own day, evidence is abundant, in
                    many communities of the State, that the early population came predominantly from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, or from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, or from New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, or from some other special locality, as the case may be, showing the tenacity with
                    which forms of speech, neighborhood customs, and household ways cling to one generation after
                    another, often in the face of powerful forces.</p>
            <p>The census of 1850 shows Indiana to have had a total white and free–colored population of
                        988,416.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Of this number, 541,079 were born in the State, and the remaining
                    number, or 45.2 per cent, were born outside the State. There were living in Indiana at the time
                    176,575 persons born in slaveholding States. The greater portion of these had come from the three
                    States, <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> A great many of the 68,651 born in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. It is well known that southern colonists came to Indiana in force earlier than
                    colonists from other sections, so that it must be true that among the 541,079 persons born in the
                    State, more than a proportionate number were born of southern parents.</p>

            <p>The census of 1860 shows changes in the flow of colonists to Indiana during the fifties.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> The number of persons born in slave–holding States and living in
                    Indiana in 1860 was 15,140 less than in 1850. In other words, the number of southerners coming into
                    Indiana between 1850 and 1860 and remaining there to the time of the taking of the census or longer
                    was 15,140 less than the number required to balance the loss by migration and death of southerners
                    who were living in the State in 1850. This is clear evidence that the great migration of southerners
                    to Indiana was over before 1850. Between 1850 and 1860 New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> gained slightly, while the Middle States and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> gained greatly in their contributions to Indiana's population. In the same
                    decade the State's foreign population increased from 54,426 to 118,184, the per cent of
                    gain being 117 as against 36.6 for the total population. In 1860 the total number born outside of
                    Indiana and living in the State was 42.6 per cent of the entire population, whereas in 1850 the same
                    element was 45.2 per cent. This is evidence that the State was maturing. The free–colored
                    population of Indiana was 11,262 in 1850, and but 11,428 in 1860. The hostile provisions regarding
                    free–colored persons proposed by the Constitutional Convention of 1850–51 and
                    ratified by the voters of the State in 1851 were evidently effective in preventing the increase of
                    this element in the population.</p>
            <p>As an offset to the great numbers of colonists coming into Indiana before the Civil War the State was
                    furnishing colonists to other States and Territories.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The bulk of these

                    maturing. Nearly all of our States that matured before the disappearance of the frontier have passed
                    through three stages of development relative to receiving and losing colonists: a first stage when
                    many come in and few emigrate; a second stage when the number of emigrants is relatively great; a

                    and was well equipped for its day.</p>
            <p>The academy continued until 1881, a period of fifty years. In 1896, the township trustee, Lewis
                    Dennis, established a township high school in one of the rooms, but this was abandoned in 1904, when

            <p>The Whitewater Monthly Meeting of Friends began the first organized movement in education here in
                    1810. A log meetinghouse was built where the present brick church now stands, on the corner of North
                    Tenth and G streets. This was also used as a school house and was open to all of the children of the
                    community. Robert Brittain taught the first school here in 1811–12.</p>
            <p>In 1836, the Friends erected a two–room brick school house on the lot south of the old
                    meeting–house. Here Isaac Hiatt conducted the first high school in <placeName>

                    </placeName> College, took charge of the Whitewater school. He taught about four years and was very
                    successful. He was succeeded by William Haughton and Dr. William Marmon, assistant, in 1846. Other
                    early teachers were Jesse Stanley and Daniel Clark.</p>
            <p>In 1856, Hiram Hadley, later principal of the Hadley Academy, took charge of the Whitewater school
                    and conducted a high school or academy for seven years. He was succeeded by Erastus Test, Matthew
                    and Eliza Charles, Mary Burson, assisted by Wilhelmina Bell Jones, and by Lydia and Jennie Burson,
                    who taught the last Friends school in this building.</p>
            <p>In 1873, the board of school trustees rented the building for public school purposes. In 1878, the
                    board purchased the property from the Whitewater Monthly Meeting. In 1888, the Mather Brothers
                    bought the building and turned in into an office building. In 1910, the building was burned.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

                    Solomon Allen, and Alfred Hadley were the most prominent members.</p>
            <p>The Manual Labor School was originally intended to be a school for both sexes in which the students
                    might get a good liberal education, and at the same time pay all or a part of their expenses by work
                    on the farm or in the shops. There were about forty acres in the grounds. A suitable building was
                    erected, was burned in 1848, but was soon rebuilt. The plan soon proved to be impracticable on such
                    a small scale and had to be given up. All but fifteen acres of the land, now contained in the
                    campus, was sold and the name of the school was changed to the Western Agricultural School. It
                    continued under this name until 1860 when it was changed to the Friends Bloomingdale Academy.</p>
            <p>Harvey Thomas, the first principal, had charge of the Manual Training School until it was changed to
                    the academy.</p>
            <p>In 1851, Barnabas C. Hobbs came from the Boarding School at Earlham and took charge of the academy.
                    For the next twenty–one years while he was principal, Bloomingdale became an educational
                    center of a wide range of territory and men, and hundreds of students received their life training
                    and education here. The attendance in 1861–62 was 148, of which 33 were in the Academic
                    Department, 49 in the Intermediate Department, 21 in the Elementary Department and 35 in the
                    Commercial Department.</p>
            <p>Some of the principals who followed Professor Hobbs are: Seth Hasby, Thomas A. Armstrong, Josiah
                    Edwards, D. N. Dannis, 1884; Hiram Hadley, 1885; A. F. Mitchell, 1888, and Caroline M. Hill, 1910.</p>
            <p>There is a long list of the alumni of the academy extending back over sixty–eight years.
                    Among the most noted ones are: Hon. Joe Cannon, in the 40's; Wallace N. Trueblood, 1869,

            <p>There are at present four buildings which belong to the academy. The main building, the gymnasium,
                    the manual training shops and Dennis hall. The class work is done in the main building. Dennis hall
                    contains the science and domestic science departments. The school has an extensive library, and in
                    1880 possessed an endowment fund of between six and seven thousand dollars. It is still controlled
                    by the Quarterly Meeting of Friends but no distinction is made between students with respect to

            <p>In 1833, Mr. Robert Harrison began the first Friends school in Indiana. In 1859, Oliver H. Bales and
                    Martha Bales organized an academic department in connection with the primary and grammar
                    departments. Rhetoric, algebra, natural philosophy and astronomy were taught in the grammar
                    department, and trigonometry, surveying and mental philosophy were taught in the academic
                    department.</p>
            <p>In 1870, the State granted a charter for the academy to Clarkson Davis, who was then superintendent.</p>
            <p>A complete list of superintendents in chronological order is as follows: Oliver H. Bales,
                    1859–63; Clarkson Davis, 1863–67; Edward Taylor, 1867–68; Clarkson

            <p>In 1871, a two–story brick building was erected. Later this was doubled in size. This
                    building was used until 1913, when a commodious and modern building, with all the modern
                    conveniences was erected. The academy is beautifully situated among the maple groves that
                    characterize the surrounding hills and valleys. The campus contains about eight acres. The west half
                    of it is devoted <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The academy is equipped with a library of about 3,000 volumes, and files of the current magazines,
                    all of which is open to the public. About 3,500 students have attended the academy since 1870. The
                    alumni association now enrolls 433 persons.</p>
            <p>The academy has a certificate of equivalency granted by the State and the course of study and

                    are qualified both in character and ability to do effective work in the line of ideals and purposes
                    of the academy. On this account it has always maintained a high moral and intellectual standard.</p>

                </p>
            <p>The Amboy Academy is located at Amboy, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami county</region>
                    </placeName>. It was founded in 1871, by the Amboy Monthly Meeting of the Society of Friends. Some
                    of the leaders in the movement were: Dr. John A. Baldwin, Robert Ridgeway, Enos Pearson, Oliver H.
                    Canady and Benjamin B. Lamb.</p>
            <p>The old building was erected, at different times, in three parts. In 1871, the Friends built the
                    two–story brick part which now forms the north wing. It contained two good sized school
                    rooms, two recitation rooms, and had two stairways, one for the boys and one for the girls. In 1878,
                    Jackson township built the two–story brick addition which forms the east wing. In 1910,
                    the town of Amboy and Jackson township, jointly, built the two–story brick addition
                    connecting the two wings. This was then used for joint graded school and high school purposes. It
                    was destroyed by fire March 9, 1910, and since then a new modern building has been erected, which
                    still bears the name of Amboy Academy.</p>
            <p>The Amboy Academy grew out of a desire among the Friends to provide a school for higher education at
                    home so that their young men and women would not have to go to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Academy or to Earlham College for such privileges.</p>
            <p>The academy was opened in the fall of 1871, with Seth G. Hastings, a graduate of Earlham College, in
                    charge of the academic department, and his wife, Edith Hastings, in charge of the primary
                    department. It was conducted under a joint arrangement between the Friends church and Jackson
                    township. The church donated the use of the building and ran the academic department, while the
                    primary department was run as a public school by the township. Professor Hastings was succeeded by
                    Daniel W. Haydock as principal, 1872–73; Charles V. Moore, 1873–74, and Irvin
                    H. Cammack, 1875.</p>
            <p>The academy was continued under the control of the Friends church until 1880, when it was merged into
                    a joint graded and high school by the town of Amboy and Jackson township.</p>
            <p>There were from forty to sixty pupils enrolled in the academy, and many of these became teachers. Mr.

                    were, Barnabus C. Hobbs, Ellis Lawrence, Charles O. Newlin, John Morgan, Amos Doan, John Moore, John
                    Kendall, T. J. Charlton, Ellis Branson and Benjamin Vestal.</p>
            <p>It had its origin in the desire of the leading citizens to establish a high school where ambitious
                    young people might prepare for college without going away from home. It was believed that if the
                    movement proved a success that the citizens would subscribe $45,000 for the erection of a
                    suitable building.</p>
            <p>The academy was opened in the fall of 1881, with Erastus Test as principal. The town hall, a
                    two–story frame building with two rooms, was donated and furnished with sixty good new
                    students' desks. The school was a success. Early in 1882, the necessary $45,000
                    was subscribed and a new two–story brick building was erected just east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plainfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> and south of the National road.</p>
            <p>Dr. Test was succeeded in June, 1883, by Joseph Roads. About this time the building was burned and
                    the present building was erected. It is a five–room, two–story brick with a
                    basement, and stands on a beautiful campus of above five acres of ground.</p>
            <p>Professor Rhodes was succeeded in order by Robert L. Kelley, 1894; Charles D. Marley, Benjamin
                    Kelley, Otis Stanton, Charles E. Cosand, Charles L. Stubbs, E. T. Albertson, 1911; Albert Hall, and
                    Simon Hester, the, present principal of the academy.</p>

                </p>
            <p>It was highly appropriate that the first Methodist academy in the State of Indiana should be named
                    after the founders of Methodism. The Wesley Academy was located at Wesley, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery county</region>
                    </placeName>. It was built from private subscriptions by the M. E. church in 1850. A paper was
                    circulated by Mr. Sant Gray, and in a short timq sufficient funds were raised to start the work.</p>
            <p>Two buildings were erected. One a recitation hall, a two–story frame structure, 65 x 45
                    feet, and the other, a dormitory, a two–and–one–half story frame
                    building with twenty–two rooms.</p>
            <p>The course of study consisted of the three "R's" grammar, algebra,
                    geography, and history. Some of the texts that were used were <hi rend="i">Ray's
                    Arithmetic</hi> and <hi rend="i">Algebra, Pineo's Grammar</hi> and <hi rend="i">Swin–ton's History</hi>. There was no library in the school, but there was
                    a small township library, and this was used occasionally. The other equipment of the school was very
                    limited. The school term usually began in September and continued about eight months, ending in
                    March or April. On an average, there were from 100 to 125 pupils in attendance. The old dormitory
                    was always full of students. Many of the older people of the county attended the academy in their
                    youth, and a number of men and women of prominence graduated from it. A number of foreign students
                    were enrolled there.</p>
            <p>Some of the teachers were: John Holloway, Addison Crear, Joseph Crear, Edward Rhodes and a Mr.
                    Harvey.</p>
            <p>The academy prospered for about eight years, then political troubles, due to the Civil War, caused it
                    to be abandoned. Years ago the old academy building was torn down. The old dormitory was used for a
                    number of years afterward for a basket ball hall. In recent years it has been remodeled and is now
                    used for a barn.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

                    present building now stands.</p>
            <p>The academy opened in 1855, with Rev. Levi Tarr as principal and Miss Low Cooper as assistant.
                    Reverend Tarr was succeeded in 1857 by Charles N. Sims, later chancellor of <placeName>

                    1860–64. In a letter concerning the academy he said that in the spring of 1861, when Fort
                    Sumpter was fired on and the Civil War broke out, about twenty–five of his fine young men
                    volunteered and his school was almost broken up. On account of the war there were no graduates in
                    1863 and 1864.</p>
            <p>In 1861, there were 342 students, 7 seniors, 26 in the middle class, 170 juniors, 53 intermediates,
                    and 86 in the primary department. The board of trustees consisted of Rev. William Campbell, W. T.
                    Wheeler, John L. Smith, Oliver Craven, Baltzer Kramer, M. D.; Allen Zount, James Miller, W. W.
                    Weekly, Joseph Cones and Jeffery Horner.</p>
            <p>John Clarke Ridpath, the historian, was assistant to Professor Smith, and succeeded him as principal
                    from 1864–67. He was followed by Rev. W. O. Wyant in 1867, and by John B. Rows in 1868,
                    when the academy was merged into the present high school. The building was used for this purpose
                    until 1883 when it was torn down and the present building was erected.</p>
            <p>The course of study included the common branches, higher arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry,
                    surveying, Latin, Greek, literature, history, physics, chemistry, mental and moral philosophy,
                    analogy and the evidences of Christianity.</p>
            <p>The school was co–educational. The school year was divided into three terms and continued
                    for nine months. School began at 8:30 A<hi rend="sc">. M.</hi> and closed at 4:00 p. M<hi rend="sc">.</hi> The academy was equipped with a small library and some physical apparatus.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

                    subscription. The capital stock was fixed at $20,000, divided into shares of
                    $20 each. The trustees elected in 1858 were J. W. B. Moore, E. Pyeatt and William Jones.
                    Dr. H. S. Talbott was agent. The campaign for subscriptions continued through the year <hi rend="i">1858</hi> and most of the stock was subscribed for.</p>
            <p>The work on the building was begun in 1858, but it progressed slowly and the cornerstone was not laid
                    until July 11, 1859. It was hoped that the building might be ready for use by September 1, 1861, but
                    in the meantime the Civil War had begun and the repeated calls for money for the academy, in those
                    days of hard times and great excitement, were met by calls for volunteers for the preservation of
                    the Union. The latter calls were for a time the more popular and work on the academy ceased. The
                    movement was kept alive, however, and largely due to the influence of Gen. James C. Veach and Thomas
                    F. DeBruler it was completed in 1863.</p>
            <p>The building is a brick structure, 50 x 70 feet, three stories high, with a large
                    bell–tower on top. It contains eight rooms. Hallways running north and south separate the
                    rooms on the east from those on the west. It stands near the center of the double square between
                    Sixth and Eighth streets, facing Walnut street on the north. The buildings and grounds were valued
                    in 1865, at $31,000. The campus contains about five acres and is well shaded with beech
                    and maple trees.</p>
            <p>In September, 1863, the school was opened and the name was changed to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName> Collegiate Institute, but it has generally been known by either name. Prof. W. S.
                    Hooper, of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName> Academy, was the first principal with this sister, Miss Sue Hooper, as assistant. At
                    that time only two rooms had been finished for school purposes. The enrollment at the beginning was
                    50, but it increased to 87 by the end of the first term, and to 135 by the end of the year. The
                    schools was equipped with a $425 piano, a set of philosophical apparatus costing
                    $500, and a small library.</p>
            <p>In 1866, Professor Hooper was succeeded by Prof. C. H. Smith,. A. M., of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Academy, with Prof. John W. Webb, A. M., and Prof. William F. Gillmore, A. M., as
                    assistants. The enrollment during this year was 197. The school was co–educational. Young
                    ladies were graduated from a full college course, and young men were prepared for the university.</p>
            <p>In 1866, a frame addition was built to the academy building <pb n="20" id="VAA4025-011-1-026"/> which
                    served for a dining room and kitchen. This was designed for students who came from a distance. It
                    was used until about 1878 when it was torn down.</p>
            <p>In 1868, there were five members in the faculty, and 165 students were enrolled. The tuition in the
                    college classes was $10 per term.</p>
            <p>In 1870, Professor Smith was succeeded by Dr. C. Culley, A. M., of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, who was principal until 1873. The course of study then consisted of a
                    two–year preparatory college course, and a three–year academic course,
                    equivalent to our present high school course, including analogy and the evidence of Christianity.</p>
            <p>Educationally, the Collegiate Institute was among the foremost of the State. From it many of the old
                    citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and others, were graduated. From there they went to Depauw University or to Indiana
                    University. Like many of the other academies, however, it was a failure financially. The common
                    schools and the free high school system became more popular and the institute rapidly declined in
                    influence.</p>
            <p>In 1873, the Indiana Conference found itself in debt on account of the institute, about
                    $1,800, which indebtedness was secured by a mortgage upon the building and grounds. No
                    effort was made to pay it off, although the debt was not great in proportion to the value of the
                    property. The building, grounds, and equipment were sold to the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName> for $9,800. The $1,800 indebtedness was paid on and the balance,
                    $8,000, was ordered to be distributed pro rata among the stockholders and donors.</p>
            <p>The building is still standing, in good condition, and has been used for the high school since
                        1873.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

                    about 1829.</p>
            <p>In 1856, Jesse F. Matlock, who held a claim on these lots, secured possession of them by a judgment
                    of the court, and the seminary was moved into a new frame building just across the street, which had
                    been built for the purpose.</p>
            <p>In 1859, the Methodist Episcopal church bought the academy building from Jesse F. Matlock, and in
                    about 1861 or 1862, they erected a three–story brick building immediately in front of it,
                    which forms with the old part the shape of an "L." The entire building then
                    contained about sixteen rooms and a large chapel which was used for religious purposes.</p>
            <p>Rev. Levi Tarr was the first principal from 1858–63, assisted by Mrs. A. C. Tarr, Miss

            <p>In 1864, Prof. C. H. Smith, formerly principal of the Thorn–town Academy, became
                    principal, assisted by James Johnson, Mrs. Charlotte Thompson, and Miss Wells. Miss Belle Morrison
                    was teacher of music. Professor Smith was succeeded by Professor Lumis and his wife in 1867, and
                    they remained in charge until it was closed in 1868.</p>
            <p>The academy was equipped with a small library and some physical and chemical apparatus. The course of
                    study was practically the same as that of the Thorntown and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName> academies, and was designed to prepare students to enter Asbury College. Some of the
                    texts that were used were <hi rend="i">Anthony's Latin Books,
                        McClin–tock's Greek</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Loomis's
                    Mathematics</hi>, including algebra, geometry and trigonometry. The school term was nine months in
                    length, beginning in September and ending in June. It was co–educational.</p>
            <p>Some of the students who have since gained distinction are: John V. Hadley, of the Supreme Court of
                    Indiana; R. B. Blake, of the Supreme Court of the State of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and Enoch G. Hogate, dean of the Indiana University Law School.</p>
            <p>After the academy closed in 1868, the Methodist Episcopal . church continued to use the chapel for
                    religious services until the new church was completed on South <placeName>

                    and growing in power and influence with the years.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

               </placeName>. It was
                    founded by the Christian church in 1838. A log house, 30 x 50 feet was built, which served as a
                    church and school house combined. The building stood north and south. The pulpit was in the north
                    and between the two doors. The south end had a raised floor. A partition, which was made in sections
                    and fastened by hinges to the ceiling, divided the room into two equal parts. For church purposes
                    the partition was folded up so as to make one large room, while for school purposes the parition was
                    let down, making two rooms.</p>
            <p>The academy opened about the middle of September, 1838, with James Fanning, a college graduate, as
                    principal, and his wife, a graduate of a female seminary, as assistant. Professor Fanning taught the
                    boys in the north room, and Mrs. Fanning taught the girls in the south room. Although the academy
                    was open to both sexes it was not co–educational. The boys and girls were kept as
                    separate as if they had attended schools in different buildings. The sentiment of the community in
                    those days was bitterly opposed to co–education and this fact almost doubled the expense
                    of education and made a graded system almost impossible.</p>

                    Male Academy." R. M. Johnson was the first principal and Jesse Waldon assistant. The
                    academy ran smoothly for the first year; then religious dissentions arose which not only materially
                    weakened the Male Academy but seriously injured the Female Seminary as well. The histories of these
                    two schools are so interwoven on account of the petty jealousies and religious strife, that the
                    history of the one can not be detailed without referring in part to the history of the other.</p>
            <p>The Christian church had failed in its first attempt to found an academy at Haw Creek in 1838; the
                    Methodists had founded the Wesley Academy at Wesley in 1850; the Presbyterians had founded the <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1849; and the Baptists undertook to found a seminary for girls at <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1855. They erected a brick building for the seminary, and a two–story
                    frame structure with a basement for a girls' dormitory. The seminary was equipped with
                    philosophical and chemical apparatus. The grounds, buildings and equipment cost about
                    $10,000. The seminary was opened in the fall of 1855, with Gibbon Williams,
                    superintendent in general; his daughter, Emily, as principal; his other daughter, Jennie, his son,
                    Daniel, and his cousin, as assistants. His wife was matron of the girls' dormitory. Miss
                    Mary Crane was teacher of music and drawing, and Miss Mary Bell was teacher of writing.</p>
            <p>Originally the seminary was intended for girls only, but in order to make it
                    self–supporting, boys were admitted from the beginning. The first year the seminary was a
                    success. A movement was then started for the founding of a school for boys only, which resulted in
                    the establishment of the Male Academy by the <list type="footnotes">

                    understood and agreed to by both churches that the Baptist Seminary was to be open to girls only,
                    and that the Christian Academy was to be open to boys only, and that both denominations should
                    patronize both schools. The Baptists had the better of the bargain since they were fewer in number
                    and would profit most by the mutual exchange of students. The Baptists were charged with bad faith,
                    however, in sending their boys to the Baptist college at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> rather than to the Male Academy. On January 1, 1859, the stockholders of the academy,
                    after a financial failure the year before, met and voted 114 to 20 in favor of admitting girls to
                    the academy. As a result fifty–five girls entered the following Monday. This was done to
                    relieve the financial difficulty just as the seminary had done four years before when it admitted
                    boys. The stockholders of the academy who were opposed to the change withdrew their boys from the
                    academy, and these with others from the seminary and some who returned from <placeName>

                    fitted up for the school and Jennie Williams was made principal.</p>
            <p>As a result of this sectarian strife all three of the schools were in bad condition by the end of the
                    year 1859. Mr. Williams, disgusted and disappointed, resigned from the seminary. Mr. Johnson, after
                    a wrangle with the trustees over his salary, left the academy in debt $3,500. The Baptist
                    school for boys proved a failure and was soon abandoned. The academy and seminary both continued for
                    a number of years and both were co–educational.</p>
            <p>For the next four years the seminary was in charge of Professor Bailey, assisted by his sister, Miss
                    Clara Perkins, Miss Clara Smith and the Dyer sisters. They came from the Eastern States and were
                    well qualified teachers for those days. During the next seven years it seems to have died a
                    lingering death under the supervision of Messrs. Hill and Smith, and Vaughter and DeBolt.</p>
            <p>In 1859, Professor Young was principal of the academy. He was succeeded by Professors <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Goodwin. The academy was still in debt $3,500 and would have been sold
                    had not Milton B. Hopkins assumed the debt on condition that the property was to be his if he should
                    succeed in cancelling the debt. For six years he conducted the most successful school ever held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ladoga</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but in the end it proved a failure financially and he abandoned the enterprise. The
                    school lingered on a year or two longer under <pb n="28" id="VAA4025-011-1-034"/> A. H. Moore and
                    his home force of teachers, but about this time the common school wave struck <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ladoga</settlement>
                    </placeName> and, like many of the other academies, it went down before it.</p>
            <p>The course of study was practically the same as that of other academies of its day—the
                    common branches and a college preparatory course.</p>
            <p>In connection with the academy there were two literary societies, the Adalphian, for boys, and the
                    Floridian, for girls. A special room in the academy was set apart for their meetings in which
                    debates, orations, essays and poems were given. At the close of each year the two societies gave an
                    exhibition which became a prominent feature in the life at <placeName>

                    center of the public square. The building was to be used for school purposes, religious worship, and
                    for all lawful meetings of the citizens. The contract was let by public outcry to the lowest bidder

                    Near the close of the year the White River Conference agreed to co–operate with the

            <p>He first attended school in the old log cabin school house which he later described in his
                    "Early School Days in Indiana." After this he studied algebra, geometry,
                    surveying, Latin and Greek in the old County Seminary of <placeName>

                    later known as the Earlham College of which he became president.</p>
            <p>In 1851 he moved to Bloomingdale and took charge of the Friends' Bloomingdale Academy. Here
                    he remained for twenty–one years, the best period of his life.</p>
            <p>In 1866 Governor Oliver P. Morton appointed him a member of the board of trustees of the new State

            <p>In 1877 he was sent as a member of the Peace Society to Europe where he remained for two years. On
                    his return he made frequent addresses at various conferences on peace and arbitration, the most

            <p>His last years were spent as president of Earlham College, where, broken in health yet full of

                    associated with him in the work. In the meantime he had been nominated for State Superintendent of
                    Public Instruction, and was elected in the fall of 1870. As a State Superintendent he ranked among
                    the foremost of those of his day, and was re–elected in 1872 Overwork, however, soon
                    forced him to give up the duties of his office, and he retired to the foothills of the <placeName>

                    University, which position he held until 1894 when it was discontinued. From 1894 to 1910 he was
                    Professor of Mathematics in Purdue University. In July, 1910, he was retired, at his own request, on

            <p>Rev. J<hi rend="sc">OHN MAGILL JOHNSON</hi> was born January 9, 1826, about two miles northwest of
                    the town of Big Springs, Crawford county, Indiana. His father, W. B. Johnson, was one of the pioneer
                    district school teachers, having taught from 1821 to about 1865.</p>
            <p>At the age of six the son entered the district schools, and at the age of twelve, he and a young man

                    University and graduated with the degree of bachelor of arts in 1851. A few years later the
                    university conferred upon him and his class the honorary degree of master of arts.</p>
            <p>He taught his first school in 1847. In 1851 he was licensed to preach and since that time he has been
                    a very active and able minister as well as a teacher.</p>
            <p>In March, 1869, he founded Marengo Academy. For the following twenty–five years he devoted
                    his whole soul and body to teaching in the academy and in preaching to his people.</p>
            <p>Reverend Johnson is still living at Marengo and is a well preserved man. He is one of the oldest
                    alumni of Indiana University.</p>
            <p>Prof. O<hi rend="sc">LIVER</hi> H. S<hi rend="sc">MITH</hi> is a native Hoosier, born in 1831. He
                    worked his way through college and graduated at the old Asbury College in 1856. The same year he

            <p>From 1858 to 1864 he was connected with the Thorntown Academy, the first two years as assistant and

                    1874–76, he had charge of the academy for about twenty years. The best years of his life
                    were spent there, and the high moral, spiritual and intellectual standards set by him in that
                    community of Friends were of countless value to the young men and women of that period who went out
                    from the academy to battle with life.</p>
            <p>The last years of his life was a grim struggle against the "white plague." In 1882

            <p>Upon the death of his wife in 1900, Dr. Benton retired from professional life to devote the remainder

            <p>Although this early period is generally regarded as a period of <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-011-1-045"/>
                    ignorance and inactivity in education, such was not wholly the case. Dotted here and there over the
                    State in the most enlightened and progressive communities stood the old academies and seminaries,
                    like the monasteries during the Middle Ages, where the ambitious youths were instructed in the
                    higher branches of learning—courses which were the equivalent and in some respects
                    superior to our present high school course.</p>
            <p>In the absence of our free system of common and high schools, the academies had to depend exclusively
                    upon tuition or private donations for their support. On this account many of them early made
                    shipwreck, and almost all of them went down before the great wave of the free public school system
                    which swept over the State from 1852 to 1870.</p>
            <p>In many of the communities education was closely allied with religion, and nearly all of the
                    churches, when possible, made some effort to afford facilities for higher education.</p>
            <p>The Friends were among the most active in this movement. This may have been in part due to their
                    peculiar religious belief. By the side of their meeting–houses they almost invariably
                    erected a little cabin for a school house. They never patronized the free schools so long as their
                    numbers and means would warrant them in maintaining one of their own, where the discipline and
                    management were entirely under their control.</p>
            <p>Back in the early days of the academies we find the first beginnings in agriculture, manual training,
                    and domestic science, all of which we are inclined to consider today as modern school problems. The
                    ideals and principles that they attempted to work out then are practically the same that confront
                    the modern educators of today. This early movement failed because it had to be conducted on too
                    small a scale.</p>
            <p>The old academies had an up hill fight from the beginning, but they filled a deeply felt need in
                    education, and their memory is often the most precious thing in the lives of the old pioneers.</p>

            <p>Indiana holds the distinction of having the oldest State federation of labor, in point of continuous
                    existence, of any American commonwealth. The "Indiana Federation of Trade and Labor
                    Unions," known since 1897 as the "Indiana State Federation of Labor," was
                    organized at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, September 9, 1885. The idea of forming such a, body originated with the members of
                    "International Typographical Union, No. 1," of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was felt that the time had come when, in many ways, the cause of organized labor
                    could be promoted by the co–operation of all unions in the State through a central body.
                    Co–operation of minor importance had always existed since the first unions were formed,
                    but there was need now to secure more general unity of action. Consequently the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> printers sent forth a call to all the labor bodies in the State for a meeting to
                    consider the advisability of forming a federation.</p>
            <p>The call was responded to by less than a dozen delegates representing "Alpha" and
                    "Armstrong" Assemblies of the "Knights of Labor,"
                    "Moulders' Union No. 56," "Cigar Makers' Union No.
                    33" and "Typographical Union No. 1." All of these organizations were in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From other points in the State there was no representation.</p>
            <p>The records of the first meeting were not printed. A certified account of what occurred indicates
                    that a declaration of principles and a constitution were adopted. The former gave as the purposes of
                    the Federation the intention to foster amicable relations between local and central labor unions in
                    the State, to secure general co–operation for the betterment of labor conditions and to
                    obtain such wages as were considered justly due the several classes of workmen.</p>

                    Leffingwell of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was elected president and Milton G. Farnham, also of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, recording secretary. Altogether the first session of the Federation accomplished
                    little beyond perfecting an organization and taking steps for its perpetuation. Yet a spirit of
                    optimism as to the future was aroused, and new ties in the, labor world were recognized as having
                    been forged. As President Leffingwell said, "The first meeting was one of happy
                    inter–change of feeling and opinions and great hopes were entertained of good results to
                    come from future sessions, when the State would be more largely represented."</p>
            <p>The second session of the Federation was held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in Workingman's Hall, June 8, 1886. Thirty–three delegates were
                    present, representing twenty–four unions and central labor bodies. That the session was a
                    live one is indicated by the fact that in the election for president the first ballot resulted in a
                    tie vote between Mr. Leffingwell and Emil Levy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Upon a second ballot Mr. Leffingwell received one majority.</p>
            <p>In his address to the convention President Leffingwell set forth at length the purposes of the
                    Federation. He said:</p>
            <p>"We have met here, then, to exert our efforts towards the amelioration of the conditions of
                    all who labor; to bring about something like an equitable distribution of the wealth produced by
                    labor; to protect not only our rights as citizens, but to protect ourselves in life and limb in the
                    various occupations which we are allotted to pursue.</p>
            <p>"The real issue in this great struggle is that of labor and small capitalists versus the
                    giant demon of monopoly. We mean no antagonism to capital legitimately invested, but we must favor
                    and urge such legislation as will prevent the unjust accumulation of wealth. The equal organization
                    of capital and labor should result in a harmony of relations to each other and in justice to both.</p>
            <p>"We must proclaim it as a fixed principle with us that our means of obtaining redress from
                    ills of which we complain are lawful and peaceful. ⋆ ⋆ ⋆ You will
                    And it among the duties of your mission here to formulate some plan by which enactment can be made
                    in our State legislative body tending to relieve labor of much of the burden which now weighs upon
                    it."</p>
            <p>The address also sounded a warning against labor's indulgence in acts of lawlessness,
                    disorder and violence, which were characterized as "productive of confusion and
                    misrule" and leading to "dissolution and desolation."</p>
            <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-011-1-048"/>
            <p>Up to 1891 all conventions of the Federation were held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In that year a resolution was adopted providing that future conventions be held in
                    different localities each year, "thus calling out a representation from cities that have
                    never before responded."</p>
            <p>From 1892 to 1900 the conventions met as follows: 1892 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1893 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1894 at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, 1895 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1896 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1897 at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName>, 1898 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1899 at EI–wood and 1900 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It will be noted that the conventions all met in cities located in the central or the northern part
                    of the State. Southern Indiana, outside of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has never afforded much opportunity for labor organization. Conventions were naturally
                    held where their influence would result in the greatest good to the labor movement.</p>
            <p>The presidents of the Federation from 1885 to 1900 were: 1885–87, Samuel L. Leffingwell of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Central Labor Union; 1887–91, Emil Levy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Cigar Makers' Union; 1891–93, Thomas M. Gruelle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Printers' Union; 1893–95, Joseph F. Suchawk of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Cigar Makers' Union; 1895–1900, Edgar A. Perkins of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Printers' Union.</p>
            <p>Although this article is not directly concerned with the history of the Federation after 1900,
                    mention might be made of the fact that Mr. Perkins acted as president of the organization for
                    eighteen consecutive years with the exception of one term, when John Hughes of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> "Central Labor Union" was elected in 1909. In 1913 Mr. Perkins
                    resigned and was succeeded by John Fox of "Miners' District No. 11," <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>

                </p>
            <p>The constitution of 1886 provided that the Federation should be composed "of representatives
                    or alternates of the labor organizations of the State who should be elected by such
                    bodies." In reality, however, the Federation came to be made up of the various
                    organizations affiliated with it and not of delegates to the annual conventions. Just as in the
                    "American Federation of Labor" many organizations which held membership in the
                    general body failed for one cause or another to send representatives to the convention. Only those
                    organizations which were in good standing with dues and taxes paid up to date were allowed to seat
                    delegates at conventions. <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-011-1-049"/> Bona fide labor organizations alone
                    were admitted to membership.</p>
            <p>Down to 1890 the constitution provided that "Each Trade Assembly, District Assembly or
                    Central Organization shall be entitled to three representatives; each local organization shall be
                    entitled to one representative for every one hundred members or less. Two or more organizations may
                    unite in sending one representative." In 1890 the number of delegates allowed the first
                    group of organizations was increased to five and local organizations were allowed to send one
                    delegate for each fifty members or less. The provision as to joint delegates remained unchanged. The
                    expenses of delegates in all cases were to be borne by the bodies they represented. Delegates were
                    limited to one vote each, and no proxies were allowed. Ex–delegates were early given the
                    right to a seat in conventions, with all privileges of the floor, but were not allowed to vote.</p>

            <p>While these figures are taken from the reports)'of the conventions they do not show the
                    total strength of the Federation. Allowance must be made for the fact that each year many
                    organizations affiliated with the Federation failed to send delegates. Moreover, a large number of
                    them annually sent only a part of their quota of representatives. Finally it should be noted that
                    about one–third of the organizations represented were central, district or State bodies
                    composed of a large number of local unions, all of which must be included in determining the extent
                    of the Federation.</p>
            <p>The table given shows a steady increase in the size of the convention save for the period from 1892
                    to 1896. The decrease indicated here is due to the panic of 1893, which demoralized labor
                    organizations <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-011-1-050"/> everywhere. It might also be stated here that
                    while assemblies of the "Knights of Labor" were active in forming the Federation
                    in 1885, they disappeared from its ranks later on when the "Knights" were
                    disrupted by their fight with the International Unions affiliated with the "American
                    Federation of Labor."</p>

                    <hi rend="sc">GOVERNMENT AND POWERS</hi>
                </p>
            <p>From the outset the authority of the Federation over local, central and district unions was limited.
                    "Local autonomy" was largely observed. The Federation restricted itself to
                    recommendatory proposals save in a few cases, as, for example, when it provided in 1886 that all
                    affiliated organizations must admit women to membership, give them the same privileges as men and
                    secure for them the same wages as for men for like work performed. ' The chief office of
                    the Federation was to promote legislation and form new unions and city central bodies. Any attempt
                    to usurp the powers of local organizations would have met strong opposition and endangered the
                    usefulness of the Federation.</p>
            <p>In his address to the convention of 1896 President Perkins spoke on the above point as follows:</p>
            <p>The constant tendency to assume powers not theirs, to extend the scope of their workings and to
                    arrogate to themselves powers which can not belong to them, is as much to be frowned upon and
                    resented in our labor organizations as it is in our body politic. Especially is this tendency shown
                    in our federated bodies. The fact is lost sight of that they are but the creatures of the locals;
                    that they are at the best but recommendatory organizations. The tendency of extension should be
                    tempered by the most careful scrutiny, in that no rights of the locals, the genesis of the movement,
                    should be infringed upon."</p>
            <p>While the Federation rarely infringed upon the original powers of the local organizations affiliated
                    with it it did not, during the period under consideration, attach itself to any national labor
                    organization. As early as 1886 the Federation endorsed the work of the "Knights of
                    Labor" and pledged co–operation with them in ameliorating the condition of the
                    working classes. Affiliation with the "Knights," however, was made impossible by
                    their waning influence and different type of organization. In 1886 the "American Federation
                    of Labor" began its career. Its purposes and program in a national way corresponded to what
                    the "Indiana Federation" aimed to do in a' State way. Repeated efforts
                    were made in the conventions <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-011-1-051"/> of the latter after 1886 to obtain
                    a vote favorable to affiliation with the "American Federation." In each case,
                    however, the proposition was lost, though in 1890 President Levy in his report advocated the
                    adoption of such a measure.</p>
            <p>Several reasons may be given for the attitude taken upon this question. In the first place the
                    "American Federation" during the greater part of the period was engaged in a life
                    and death struggle with the "Knights of Labor." While the Federation gradually
                    displaced its rival yet the Indiana organization, which was comparatively well established, had
                    nothing to gain by joining in the fight. Secondly, the "Indiana Federation" feared
                    that affiliation with the larger national body might deprive it of part of its power. Finally the
                    financial resources of the "State Federation" were at all times limited, and
                    affiliation would have meant added current expense through dues and assessments. The last argument
                    was the one most generally used in debating the question, but it may be safely said that the first
                    two reasons were dominant in the minds of the delegates in opposition.</p>
            <p>The constitution of 1885 provided for a president, a recording secretary and thirteen
                    vice–presidents, one from each congressional district, all to be chosen at an annual
                    convention. The president and secretary were elected by the convention as a whole while the
                    vice–presidents were elected by the delegates from the several congressional districts.
                    An executive board composed of fifteen officers was given power to conduct such business as might
                    come up during the intervals between the regular sessions of the Federation. The president was also
                    given authority to appoint a legislative board or committee of seven, of which he and the secretary
                    were members ex officio.</p>
            <p>This system of government and administration soon exhibited glaring defects. The full quota of
                    vice–presidents was seldom filled. At practically every convention one or more
                    congressional districts lacked representation. Although this circumstance cut down the size of the
                    executive board to some extent, yet that body was too large and too widely scattered to make it easy
                    for the board to transact business. The legislative committee was weak because, except for the
                    president and secretary, none of its members were in a position to know what the needs of the
                    Federation were and how desirable legislation could be enacted. Its appropriation also was too
                    small. Finally the board could not act upon its own initiative in important <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-011-1-052"/> cases. By the time the Federation granted it authority to act the time
                    for action had usually passed.</p>
            <p>In general the system of administration first provided lacked that centralization of authority which
                    produces quick and decisive action. The president was a mere figurehead who presided over the annual
                    convention but had no control over the Federation's affairs when conventions had adjourned.
                    As a result of these conditions the affiliated organizations manifested little active interest in
                    the Federation during the first years of its existence. The ship drifted along with no commanding
                    officer authorized to steer a definite course.</p>
            <p>In 1895, with the advent of the so–called "Perkins administration" a new
                    policy was entered upon. Mr. Perkins had for many years been an active worker in his own union, the
                    printers, and also in the Federation. His thorough understanding of the Federation's
                    machinery and his belief that it needed radical reorganization led to reform when he was elected
                    president. His main contention, as expressed in his address to the convention in 1896, was that
                    "there must be lodged in some one the power of supervision— some one who can
                    outline a policy and direct it."</p>
            <p>Mr. Perkins' plan provided for a president and a secretary–treasurer whose terms
                    should be for two years, and three vice–presidents to be elected annually. The president
                    was to be the chairman of the executive committee, which, in addition to its ordinary duties, was to
                    take over the work of the legislative committee. He also desired that the president be given power
                    to appoint organizers. In 1891 the convention had provided for three organizers to be elected
                    annually. As finally adopted the revised plan provided for a president,
                    secretary–treasurer, first and second vice–presidents and three organizers.
                    These officers composed both the executive and the legislative committees. All were to be elected in
                    annual convention.</p>
            <p>In 1897 the constitution was again revised and the policy of centralizing control and authority was
                    carried still further. The three organizers, hitherto elected by the convention, were dispensed with
                    and power was given the president to adopt such agents. Furthermore the organizers were excluded
                    from membership on the executive committee, which was thus reduced to four members. In 1898 an
                    unsuccessful attempts was made by a few "insurgents" in the convention to deprive
                    the president of his appointive power over the organizers. It was fortunate for the Federation that
                    this effort <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-011-1-053"/> to destroy centralization was defeated. At the same
                    time there was a movement to defeat the administration in office. This also failed. First
                    Vice–president Philip K. Reinbold, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was one of the leaders of the group making the attack.</p>
            <p>In 1899 a third vice–president was added. Provision was also made that at least one of the
                    officers should be a resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This officer, because of his location in the capital city, was designated chairman of
                    the legislative committee, the membership of which, however, remained identical with that of the
                    executive committee. Of the latter body the president of the Federation was chairman. After 1900
                    further changes were made in the number and duties of officers, but such do not concern us here.</p>
            <p>In 1897 the work of the convention required constitutional provision for seven committees: namely, on
                    finance, resolutions, petitions, laws, state of organization, president's address and
                    secretary–treasurer's report. These committees are substantially the same as
                    those required at the present time.</p>
            <p>In concluding the discussion of the Federation's government and powers it is interesting to
                    note that in 1899 a resolution providing for the incorporation of the organization under the Indiana
                    laws was proposed. In 1895 the secretary–treasurer absconded with the funds of the
                    organization. It was felt by those who endorsed the plan for incorporation that by obtaining legal
                    standing under a State charter better protection could be extended over the treasury. The fact that
                    incorporation was considered contrary to the policy of trade unionism and would have prevented the
                    use of funds except in specified ways caused the Federation to vote down the resolution.</p>
            <p rend="center">
                    <hi rend="sc">FINANCE</hi>
                </p>
            <p>The constitution of 1886 provided for revenue as follows: "Each organization applying for
                    admission to membership to this Federation shall pay an entrance fee of three dollars per delegate,
                    and an annual per capita tax of two cents on all members in good standing, payable quarterly, so
                    long as such organization continues its membership."</p>
            <p>It soon became evident that the initiation fee was so high as to discourage many unions from joining
                    the Federation. Consequently, in the late eighties it was reduced to a fiat three dollar basis,
                    regardless of the number of delegates sent to the convention. In 1890 <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-011-1-054"/> the fee was lowered still further to two dollars, and in 1896 to one
                    dollar.</p>
            <p>The per capita tax also underwent change. When the initiation fee was first lowered the tax was
                    raised to six cents. In 1890 it was increased to seven cents and in 1892 lowered to five cents. No
                    provision was made for collecting a higher tax from trade councils and other central bodies than
                    from local unions. Yet the former were allowed three delegates in the convention while the latter
                    were allotted but one delegate for each fifty members. Large local unions, it is true, could have
                    had as many delegates as some of the central bodies. The small local union, however, felt that it
                    was being subjected to too much taxation without enough representation. Consequently the Federation
                    in 1896 provided that local unions should continue to pay a five cent per capita tax, but that the
                    levy on central labor unions, trade councils and similar organizations should be raised to fifteen
                    cents. This revision proved satisfactory, and it was continued in operation throughout the period
                    under consideration.</p>
            <p>The repeated changes in the size of the initiation fee and per capita tax show something of the
                    financial difficulties of the Federation. When the burden put on organizations desired as members
                    was too high, few could afford to join; when too low the Federation ran short of funds. Profiting by
                    experience, the Federation aimed to arrive at a "happy medium." Provision was also
                    made in the early constitutions for special assessments, but there is no record that such were ever
                    levied. The figures available show that the receipts from initiation fees remained fairly uniform
                    after the first year. In 1886 they amounted to $99.00. From 1890 to 1900 they varied from
                    $6.00 to 26.00 per annum. The receipts from the per capita tax increased from
                    $27.00 in 1890 to $246.48 in 1900.</p>
            <p>In addition to the above sources of revenue, which provided what was termed the "general
                    fund," the Federation during the latter part of the period relied upon voluntary
                    contributions solicited for special purposes. In 1897 and 1898 the executive committee called for
                    special financial assistance to further the work of forming new unions. In 1898 over seventy dollars
                    realized in this way was used in organizing the miners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess county</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>While the funds obtained through voluntary contributions were in actual practice, used only for the
                    purposes specified in the calls sent out, there was no constitutional provision to prevent the
                    Federation from spending the money any way it saw fit. In 1899, therefore, <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-011-1-055"/> an amendment to the constitution was adopted definitely, giving the
                    president power to solicit voluntary contributions but requiring further that the funds raised
                    should be used only for the objects specified except by unanimous vote of the executive committee or
                    by a two–thirds vote of the Federation in convention assembled. Some of the money raised
                    in this way, after 1898, was used to enforce labor laws and to finance suits brought in court to
                    test the constitutionality of other acts. The total. receipts realized in this way in 1899 were
                    $301.03, more than was raised from any other one source.</p>
            <p>The officers of the Federation at first received no regular salaries. Their expenses while engaged on
                    Federation business, however, were paid. Members of the legislative committee were allowed
                    $2.50 and expenses for their actual services, "hotel expenses not to exceed
                    $1.50 per day." All money from the general fund was paid out only upon the order
                    of the convention.</p>
            <p>In 1895 the president was granted a salary of $25.00 a year and the
                    secretary–treasurer $50.00 a year, together with the necessary expenses in
                    each case. Compensation for work on the legislative committee remained unchanged. Since 1900
                    officers' salaries have been materially raised, but they are yet quite low. With the
                    limited revenue of the Federation strict economy has been necessary. Aside from salaries the main
                    expenditures from the general fund have consisted largely of such items as printing, postage and
                    maintenance of legislative lobbying. The publication and distribution of convention proceedings,
                    circulars and advertising material intended to educate the people of the State in regard to the work
                    of the Federation in 1900 required about $250.00 or 66 per cent of the general fund.</p>

                    <hi rend="sc">ORGANIZATION AND PUBLICITY</hi>
                </p>
            <p>One of the important functions of the "Indiana Federation of Labor" has been the
                    formation of local and city central unions. As early as 1886 the organization of central labor
                    unions in all communities where three or more local unions existed was decided upon. Since that time
                    there has been growing activity in pursuing this policy. Once such bodies have been created their
                    membership in the Federation has then been secured.</p>
            <p>Considerable effort has also been spent to organize local trade and labor unions. In this field,
                    however, the Federation has had to <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-011-1-056"/> proceed cautiously in order
                    not to conflict win the national and international trade unions within whose jurisdiction the local
                    bodies lay. Friction has arisen only in a few cases sine the Federation has been careful to act in
                    conjunction with and upon the advice of the national and international unions.</p>
            <p>According to President Perkins the Federation has acted wisely in imposing most of the burden of
                    organizing local trade unions upon the respective national bodies In 1898 he said:</p>
            <p>"I believe the organizers of this body are in the nature of representatives of the State
                    Federation in their respective districts—that their duty lies in creating a sentiment
                    among the local unions favorable to affiliation with the state body. Organization is a peculiar
                    function of the national organizations, and –while I think our organizers have a perfect
                    right to form unions Wherever possible they should in all eases defer to organizers of national
                    bodies. Any other policy than this might result in a clash of jurisdiction with its subsequent
                    confusion."</p>
            <p>The first organizers provided by the Federation were the thirteen vice–presidents chosen,
                    as required by the constitution of 1885, from the several congressional districts. These men were
                    supposed to form new unions in their respective territories and to secure their allegiance to the
                    Federation. Little was accomplished by this plan. The vice–presidents could devote but
                    little time to the work, since they received no remuneration save their expenses which were borne by
                    the local organizations they assisted. Moreover, many of the districts were not represented by a
                    vice–president. The reports of these officers when made were verbal and general in
                    character. No record was kept of the few unions they succeeded in forming.</p>
            <p>In 1891 a change was made whereby the annual convention of the Federation elected three organizers
                    and a general lecturer, the former to serve as part of the executive committee. The organizers
                    chosen were O. P. Smith of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D. F. Kennedy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and P. H. Carroll of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Carroll was prevented from taking an active part in the work owing to
                    "local in cumbrances peculiar to the locality which was chosen as his sphere of
                    usefulness." The other two men pushed the work of organization in the northern part of the
                    State. <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>, <settlement type="city">South

                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> were visited. Mass meetings were held to arouse enthusiasm for organized labor and to
                    place the policies of the trade union movement before the public at large. Three unions were formed
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the membership of <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-011-1-057"/> the existing unions was
                    increased. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> "Federal Labor Union No. 5592" was formed. This body in turn assisted
                    in the organization of local unions of the Barbers, Teamsters and Laborers. Impetus was also given
                    to the activity and membership of existing unions. A full report of this work was rendered the
                    Federation by Mr. Smith in 1892.</p>
            <p>The above account makes it evident that the new system even with inadequate funds was a success. Paid
                    and experienced men had superseded unpaid and inexperienced men. Still, however, the organizers were
                    creatures of the Federation in convention and not of its executive head. In 1896, as previously
                    stated, Mr. Perkins proposed that the power to choose organizers be vested in the president. In 1897
                    this plan was adopted. The president was authorized to appoint as many organizers as he deemed
                    necessary for such districts as he thought proper. The only restriction placed upon him was that his
                    appointees must be chosen from among the delegates to the convention. The president as chief
                    organizer was–now the real head of the Federation.</p>
            <p>The work of organizing was pushed as fast as the finances of the Federation would allow. The plan of
                    soliciting special contributions, as noted above, aided considerably in providing material of war.
                    The organizers together with central, local and labor unions were active throughout the State.
                    Reports rendered in 1899 show that over sixty new organizations were formed during the year in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Terrq Haute, <placeName>

               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elwood</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> special mention was made of the fact that District No. 11, "United Mine
                    Workers–of America," had affiliated with the "Central Labor
                    Union" of that city. From <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elwood</settlement>
                    </placeName> it was reported that every trade in the city was organized except the plate glass
                    workers and the barbers and that the existing unions all belonged to the Trades Council. Even a
                    "Newsboys' Protective Union," with sixty members had been formed. Reports
                    rendered in 1900 show that still greater activity followed for that year. The success attained in
                    Indiana after 1897 is typical of the growth of trade unionism throughout the country down to 1903.
                    Business was booming, work was plentiful and men could be interested in the labor movement.</p>
            <p>In some instances the Federation used its machinery to organize bodies other than trade or labor
                    unions. In 1899 the Federation endorsed the "Women's International Union Label <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-011-1-058"/> League" and authorized the organizers to institute
                    locals thereof wherever possible. It is interesting to note, also, that in 1899 a
                    "Women's Federal Labor Union" was formed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>On at least one occasion prior to 1900 the Federation organizers invaded outside territory by going
                    into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and in assisting the formation of several unions in that State. Thus in 1899 organizer
                    E. H. Evinger, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, reported that he had helped form the "Federal Labor Union" of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 111., On the other hand the Federation in 1898 approved of the action of the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Allied Printing Trades Council" in extending its jurisdiction into Indiana in
                    order to continue its fight against the W. B. Conkey Printing Company, which had moved across the
                    State line to escape the influence of the Council. The plant was finally – unionized as a
                    result, in part, of definite assistance given by the Federation.</p>
            <p>The work of organization has at all times been facilitated by publicity campaigns conducted through
                    the executive committee. These campaigns were intended not only to promote the organization of new
                    unions but also to influence public opinion in favor of labor legislation. Reports of the
                    conventions were from the first furnished to the public press. The proceedings of the conventions
                    were also printed and sent to all affiliated organizations in the State. In 1895 a privately owned
                    paper known as <hi rend="i">The Union</hi>, published at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was adopted as an "official" organ. Pamphlets, circular letters and
                    other printed matter were circulated especially among lawyers, legislators, ministers and all
                    others–who had opportunity in a special way to influence public opinion. Labor Day
                    celebrations were fostered, and encourad. It has always been the sense of the Federation that the
                    advancement of union principles can only be brought about as the support of public sentiment is
                    secured.</p>

                </p>
            <p>During the entire period of its existence the "Indiana State Federation of Labor"
                    has had as its main object the securing of desirable legislation and the enforcement of existing
                    labor laws. In this work it has succeeded in making itself a power to be reckoned with by the people
                    of the State. Primarily it has been the purpose of the Federation to secure legislation in the
                    interest <pb n="53" id="VAA4025-011-1-059"/> of organized labor. However, its efforts have not been
                    confined to this field alone. Numerous reforms have been advocated by the Federation which have been
                    of general interest to State and nation. Many of these reforms were secured during the period under
                    consideration, while others have been enacted into law since 1900.</p>
            <p>It must not be assumed that the Federation fought its battles for advanced legislation unaided., In
                    many cases it co–operated with political parties, employers' associations, and
                    civic, philanthropic or church societies. Its lobbyists were often assisted by those from other
                    labor organizations such as the "Railway Brotherhoods," the
                    "Miners" and various central labor councils together with the "Knights of
                    Labor" and the "American Federation of Labor."</p>
            <p>As noted above a legislative board or committee was created by the constitution of 1885. The
                    committee was composed of five appointed members plus the president and secretary of the Federation
                    as ex officio members. In 1896 the powers of the legislative committee were turned over to the
                    executive committee, and the actual direction of the legislative work was vested in the president.
                    Mr. Perkins, then president, had been for several years the chairman? of the legislative committee,
                    so the reorganization involved no change in leadership. It was not until 1897, however, that much
                    was accomplished under the Perkins administration.</p>
            <p>Prior to this change an attempt was made to place the legislative interests of the Federation in what
                    was known as the State Legislative Council. The Council was made up of representatives of the
                    Federation and of other labor organizations in the State. The first meeting was held in 1892 but no
                    permanent organization was formed at the time. In 1893 a second meeting was held: at which the
                    Council was organized. Local Councils were formed later, in accordance with the plans of the
                    convention. Nothing of. importance was accomplished and the Council never had another meeting. The
                    new organization was never officially countenanced by the Federation owing to the conflict'
                    of jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>For many years there was much doubt as to just how much–authority the legislative
                    committee possessed. In some instances it had assumed the right to speak unqualifiedly for labor on
                    certain measures, even though other organizations expressed conflicting views. Considerable friction
                    had been caused in this way. In 1898 the Federation was asked to state specifically what the <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-011-1-060"/> powers of the committee were. In the following year the
                    convention granted to it supreme jurisdiction in matters of legislative interest during the sessions
                    of the General Assembly. Provision was also made whereby local unions could present measures to the
                    Federation for legislative consideration. No prohibition, moreover, was placed upon the sending of
                    local union committees to the General Assembly. In case of conflicting opinions, however, the
                    Federation asserted that its representative and not those of individual unions spoke for the
                    laboring men of Indiana.</p>
            <p>The legislative committee for the most part has acted under strict instructions from the Federation.
                    At conventions such resolutions as embodied proposed bills have been turned over to the committee
                    for presentation to the General Assembly. When proposed laws have been embodied in resolutions or
                    petitions the drafting of the bill has been left to the committee. In such cases outside agencies
                    and organizations and even State officials have been asked for co–operation in framing
                    the measures correctly.</p>
            <p>In pushing a bill through the General Assembly the Federation has usually followed the course of
                    other lobbying organizations. In many instances the work has been forwarded by members of the House
                    or Senate who have held union cards. Considerable aid was secured in 1899 through the appointment of
                    J. W. Peters, secretary–treasurer of the Federation, to a clerical position in the
                    Senate. At 1899 session of the General Assembly five labor organizations were represented by their
                    committees— the Engineers, Trainmen, Firemen, Miners and the Federations.</p>
            <p>A campaign of publicity has frequently been resorted to in order to promote desired legislation. An
                    example of this kind of work is found in the efforts to secure the passage of the child labor law.
                    While this bill was before the General Assembly the president of the Federation sent out hundreds of
                    personal letters requesting ministers, lawyers, lecturers and public men to bring the question of
                    child labor before the people. Such campaigns have also been carried on between the sessions of the
                    General Assembly.</p>
            <p>As early as 1886 the Federation set out upon a legislative program. At that time President
                    Leffingwell spoke to the convention as follows:</p>
            <p>"You will find it among the duties of your mission here to formulate some plan by which
                    enactment can be made in our State Legislature tending to relieve labor of much of the burden which
                    now weighs upon it. <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-011-1-061"/> Prison labor, child labor, contract labor,
                    the education of children, protection of life and limb to employes in factories, mines and
                    workships, the regulation of the truck or store–order system of payment, the shortening
                    of hours, and other minor measures to be suggested all come legitimately within the province of
                    State legislation, and it is the main duty of this body to exert an effort to bring these measures
                    before the proper tribunal."</p>
            <p>It will not be possible to give an extended account of the entire legislative activity of the
                    Federation in this paper. Only the history of some of the more important measures can be traced
                    while other bills can be but mentioned.</p>
            <p>The existing Child Labor and Factory Inspection Acts are due largely to the efforts of the
                    "Indiana Federation of Labor." In 1886 the Federation adopted a resolution to the
                    effect that no child under the age of sixteen years should be employed in any mine, shop or factory
                    except the children of widows, when the age should be not less than fourteen years. At this time the
                    "Knights of Labor" had a bill prepared covering the ground towards which the
                    support of the Federation was thrown. This first effort, however, failed to accomplish anything. In
                    1891 a child labor law was adopted by the General Assembly, but it was of little value as no
                    penalties were imposed for its violation. In 1892 a new bill was drafted by Mr. Perkins, then
                    chairman of the Federation's legislative committee. This measure which was patterned after
                    the laws of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> received little attention until 1895, when its introduction into the legislature
                    brought forth active opposition from employers. In 1897 this bill with substantial modifications was
                    passed. Only $1,000 was appropriated for its enforcement. In 1899 the appropriation was
                    increased $500, and the salaries of the chief inspector and his two deputies were
                    advanced. The existing law providing for a State Bureau of Inspection was adopted in 1911. Owing to
                    the limitations of space it is not possible to enter into the details of any of these acts.</p>
            <p>The Prison Labor Bill, as it is known, has had an extended history. The bill was originally drafted
                    about 1889 at a meeting held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, attended by representatives of the "Knights of Labor," the
                    Federation, the Grangers and members of various trade unions. Prominent at the meeting were State
                    Senator James A. Mount and Mr. Edgar Perkins. The object, of the proposed law was to abolish
                    contract convict labor and to establish a State account system for working prisoners in State
                    institutions.</p>
            <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-011-1-062"/>
            <p>From 1891 through successive sessions of the General Assembly down to 1897 the above mentioned bill
                    was introduced, only to meet defeat in each instance. During the early part of the session of 1897
                    the bill was again rejected. Later in the session there was a meeting of representatives of the
                    "Indiana Manufacturers' Association" with the Federation's
                    legislative committee, at which time a new bill somewhat similar to the one killed was drafted.
                    After an intensive campaign of publicity this measure was enacted into law during the closing days
                    of the General Assembly. The law was defective, however, inasmuch as it failed to make an
                    appropriation for the care of prisoners thrown out of employment or for putting the public account
                    system into operation. As a result, with the expiration of existing contracts, many of the prisoners
                    were compelled to lie idle. This condition afforded a good opportunity for opponents of the public
                    account system to attack the law, and they were not slow in taking advantage of it. The original
                    Federation bill provided a competent appropriation and more carefully stipulated as to the
                    distribution and use of convict–made goods.</p>
            <p>Between the legislative sessions of 1897 and 1899 friendly conferences were held between the prison
                    authorities and representatives of the Federation. As a result an agreement was reached whereby it
                    was recommended that the contract system be abolished in 1904, when existing contracts would have
                    expired. An appropriation of $25,000 a year for five years was also asked in order to
                    establish the public account system. These provisions were embodied into law in 1899. By subsequent
                    laws in 1903 and 1909, however, the general operation of the State account system was postponed till
                    1920. Accordingly the efforts of the Federation in this connection bore little fruit.</p>
            <p>It is not possible to deal with all the acts of legislation in which the Federation was concerned
                    down to 1900. The following list indicates some of the more important laws which, in whole or part,
                    were due to the activity of the Federation:</p>
            <list type="ordered">
               <item>Prohibiting the discharge of workmen for belonging to a labor organization.</item>
               <item>Making laborers' and mechanics' wages preferred liens.</item>
               <item>Requiring weekly payments of wages.</item>
               <item>Prohibiting payment of wages in anything but lawful money.</item>
               <item>Prohibiting blacklisting.</item>
               <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-011-1-063"/>
               <item>Making employers specifically liable for damages in case of injuries incurred by their
                        employes under certain conditions.</item>
               <item>Creating a labor commission to assist in settling industrial disputes.</item>
               <item>Repealing the conspiracy laws.</item>
               <item>Making Labor Day a legal holiday.</item>
               <item>Protecting union labels from infringement.</item>
               <item>Abolishing contract labor in mines, regulating the weighing of coal and providing for greater
                        safety to miners.</item>
               <item>Amending the fire escape law.</item>
               <item>Providing for automatic couplers and continuous brakes on railway cars.</item>
               <item>Providing for safety appliances on steam boilers.</item>
               <item>Providing for temporary floors in buildings three or more stories in height while under
                        construction.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Besides these measures and many others intended for the relief and protection of labor the Federation
                    prior to 1900 favored legislation of a more general character. As early as 1886 it was the sense of
                    the organization that something should be done to prevent the adulteration of foodstuffs. In 1890
                    endorsement was given to the plan to elect <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senators by direct vote. Other measures favored at different times were an Australian
                    Ballot Law, direct primaries, the exemption of mortgages from taxation, a compulsory education law,
                    the reform of prison management and amendment of the county and township law to allow public work to
                    be done by a system of direct employment.</p>
            <p>In 1899 the Federation went on record as opposed to a further increase in the standing army of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. After a lengthy discussion the following resolutions concerning trusts was also
                    adopted:</p>
            <p>"Modern trusts are monopolies gone to seed. It is the sense of the 'Indiana
                    Federation of Labor,' in convention assembled, that we believe in a trust that takes us all
                    in, and not trusts for the few to the hurt of the many. We are unalterably and eternally opposed to
                    the centralization and combination of wealth in the hands of the few for the benefit of the few. In
                    only one sense are the labor unions like unto the over four hundred trusts in this country today,
                    which is the only redeeming quality of modern trusts, namely, in the co–operation they
                    teach the American people."</p>
            <p>In 1900 the Federation took an apparently radical step in favoring government ownership of all means
                    of production and distribution under a system of co–operative industry. It declared that
                    the emancipation of the laboring classes could be brought about only <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-011-1-064"/> by the abolition of capitalism. The truth of the matter seems to be
                    that the adoption of the resolution was a "slip" and did not indicate the real
                    sentiment of the Federation.</p>
            <p>In the early part of its career the Federation was vexed by the introduction of State and national
                    politics into its conventions. Those who were responsible for bringing up such matters doubtless
                    wished to forward the legislative policy of the organization by linking the Federation to the
                    fortunes of the party most favorable to labor. By casting the solid labor vote in one direction they
                    believed the chosen party could be elected to power. At the convention in 1888 a large part of the
                    session was devoted to the question of endorsing one or the other of the candidates for president of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. By a split vote Harrison was denounced and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> endorsed. In 1894 discussion over the current political situation became so heated that
                    the convention was split and part of the delegates withdrew. The entire Federation was threatened
                    with dissolution by this action. At the session of 1896 the silver question caused prolonged debate.
                    A committee of two "gold" and three "silver" men was appointed
                    to bring in resolutions for the convention to consider. The committee submitted majority and
                    minority reports respectively for and against "free silver." After a lengthy
                    debate the whole matter was laid upon the table. Two resolutions were then submitted providing for
                    the elimination of politics from the business of the Federation but both were rejected. In their
                    place a substitute was adopted which read in part: "We earnestly commend the aims and
                    objects of the 'American Federation of Labor' in uniting the American workmen, and
                    recommend its course and policy in working for industrial reforms, which, if adopted, must secure to
                    all a fair portion of the fruits of their labor." Since the American Federation of Labor,
                    up to that time, had not taken sides in politics, the above resolution indicates the purpose of the
                    Indiana organization to follow its course in this respect.</p>

            <byline>By J<hi rend="sc">AMES</hi> A. W<hi rend="sc">OODBURN</hi>, Professor of History, Indiana
                    University</byline>
            <p>It is not the purpose of this paper to describe the extent to which State Universities are carrying
                    on research in State and local history, or what courses they may be offering to their students in
                    this field of research and study. Information on that subject is being sought by a committee of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="msu"> Mississippi </country>
                    </placeName> Valley Historical Society, and when it is obtained it will be made available to the
                    members of this organization. I shall speak rather of the duties, opportunities and responsibilities
                    of the State University in this direction. In the brief time at my disposal I shall attempt only a
                    categorical summary of observations, leaving to the discussion any elaboration that may be though
                    fruitful.</p>
            <p>1. The first obligation resting on a State University is that which rests on every
                    university—it should be a university within the scope of its endeavor. As university men
                    we all have the same aim. Whether in research or in teaching the purposes of a State University is
                    the same as that of any other university—to advance learning, to promote culture, to
                    discover truth and to give to men and women an opportunity, in touch with leaders and laboratories
                    of learning, to know more of the arts and sciences of life. I do not see that research in State
                    history is essentially any more the function of a State University than of any other university.</p>
            <p>2. But a State is a people under some form of political organization, and every organized society,
                    and more especially the State, owes something to its history. A State entirely indifferent to its
                    history would be a sorry spectacle. Such a State is hardly known in the record of human life
                    because, should a State sink to that low level or fail to attain above it, it would cease to have a
                    history and would drop from view. Having lost all interest in its own ancestry it would cease to be
                    of interest to its posterity. The State is under obligations for its own sake, not only to preserve
                    its history, as found in its materials and memorials, its archives and documents, but to celebrate
                    that history, to publish it and make it available to <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">⋆</hi>Read before the American Historical Association at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                            </placeName>, December, 1914.</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-011-1-066"/> its students, its historians and its people. The State may,
                    therefore, very properly endow and employ its university for the promotion of this end, within
                    limits consistent with the privileges and duties of the university in all other directions. This
                    obligation the State ought to recognize and fulfill. There is not a better, more efficient or more
                    constant agency for this work of the State than the State University. It is the obvious medium in
                    connection with its State Historical Society and its Historical Commission for the prosecution of
                    this function of the State.</p>
            <p>3. It is not to be deemed essential nor even important that the university should establish
                    undergraduate courses in State history in its college of liberal arts. Arts are long and time is
                    fleeting. Other things demand attention in a liberal arts education. Graduate courses would be more
                    proper, but no one has a right to demand even these in a State University or in any other
                    university. Such courses, it should be candidly recognized, may be of interest and benefit to but a
                    small body of students. In a short university life most students will desire very properly to devote
                    their time to other and more important lines of study. I say this with some appreciation of the fact
                    that upon the question as to what knowledge is most worth while there will be sharp differences of
                    opinion, and that there are those who will contend that it is most important for a student to know
                    his own life, and that of his own people in his own State. I can only give my judgment for what it
                    may be worth, and that judgment is that other things than State and local history are more likely to
                    be conducive to a student's culture, to his training and to his higher education. We may
                    properly appreciate our local history without contending that it is just as important for the
                    training of our youth in history that they should know as well the battles of Pigeon Roost and Horse
                    Shoe Bend as to know the significance of Marathon and Waterloo. Let us base our contention for local
                    history on tenable ground.</p>
            <p>4. The Department of History in a State University should be ready and willing, within the limits of
                    its equipment, its powers and other duties, to lend its aid and co–operation to every
                    agency in the State toward the promotion of a public interest in, and a knowledge of, the
                    State's history; to an intelligent, public–spirited preservation of historical
                    materials and towards making the content of this material available in published forms. State and
                    local historical societies, teachers' associations, the public schools, etc., may <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-011-1-067"/> be sought by Departments of History in State Universities as
                    fitting instruments for co–operation.</p>
            <p>5. The State University should do more. It should sustain some agency to promote the collection and
                    publication of such materials in State history. A special historical library, and librarian,
                    scholarships and research fellowships in State history, lectureships, bulletins, magazines, a well
                    organized and well directed Historical Survey—these are obvious connections and
                    instrumentalities by which research in State history may be promoted. This would involve subsidy,
                    support, a money maintenance of men who give all or much of their time to this work, whether they be
                    on or off the teaching staff. These workers in State history at the State Universities, should be in
                    closer co–operation with the State Libraries, the State Historical commissions and State
                    Historical societies.</p>
            <p>6. The work by such, means should be in connection with and under the direction of the Department of
                    History. There need be no separate department of State History except in the sense that here is a
                    special field of research in which trained historical workers may serve the State. But a separate
                    teaching department in the college of liberal arts is uncalled for. A student is not to be expected
                    nor should he be allowed to choose such a local field as a major subject for graduation. The field
                    may be a department of useful and fruitful labor worthy of additional laborers, to which State
                    encouragement and subsidy may be given, but it does not call for a coordinate department of teaching
                    and administration.</p>
            <p>7. But research in State history offers a very fruitful field for the application and further
                    training of advanced students in history. It offers a field from which, if the field be properly
                    tilled, we may expect valuable contributions which will be of great assistance in the study of our
                    national history as well as valued additions to our historical literature. It is now easy to be
                    discerned that he who would study our national development must needs study the West, the frontier,
                    the States that grew up here, the people that settled and builded these commonwealths, the motives
                    and influences and spirit that prompted these people. He who <hi rend="i">would study our
                    national</hi> politics and parties of a hundred years ago must study the States, the parties, the
                    factions, the conditions, the political leaders in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and the Carolinas. The intelligent student sees clearly that the decisive influences
                    moved from the States to the center. No one will understand what happened <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-011-1-068"/> and why in national politics without a knowledge of State affairs and
                    State life. Nothing is more obvious than this to the students of our history. Not only these
                    students but intelligent men of affairs readily understand this. It is very forcibly illustrated for
                    them as they look at current political history. Recent American history can not be indifferent to
                    what <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> has been doing in the field of politics. What is going on in the political life of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> determines the course of American politics. From a knowledge of conditions in these and
                    other States must the historian of America make up his account. Without the records from the States
                    he cannot portray our national life in any serious or significant way. For his sources he will have
                    to look to the documents preserved in the States, to monographs and contributions on local history
                    which have been produced by laborious workers in the local field. As we know, much of this kind of
                    work has already been done and certainly the State Universities should encourage more of it in every
                    possible way. They have, or they can collect, the materials. They have, or they can train, the
                    advanced students capable of doing the svork. They can find fruitful themes for master's
                    theses and doctoral dissertations with a view to productions, not merely of local or remote or
                    antiquarian interests but of interest to our common history. I may be pardoned for naming a few such
                    themes as have been used in Indiana, which may serve to suggest similar themes for use anywhere
                    else: "The Whig Party in Indiana, in 1832 to 1852;" "The Greenback Party
                    in Indiana;" "Party Politics in Indiana during the Civil War;"
                    "Internal Improvements in Early Indiana;" "State Banking in Indiana,
                    1816–1860;" "Early Indiana Journalism;" the edition of the
                    "Governors' Messages of Indiana." These are merely examples of the
                    possibilities that are open.</p>
            <p>It behooves the State to collect and preserve the materials of its history, not only for its own sake
                    but for the sake of the country at large. The State's history will best be served by the
                    trained historical student, by men and women who can live in library and university centers, apart
                    from earning a livelihood, and who, if not themselves experts, may be apprenticed to experts in
                    investigation and research. It is at this point and in this direction that the State University
                    should lend its aid to State history by providing men who can oversee and direct capable students in
                    the study of appropriate topics, and in arranging and editing local historical <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-011-1-069"/> material. There is abundant reason why the State University should
                    cultivate this field. It is a rich field for historical study and production. The problem and
                    expense of publication and preservation need not be assumed by the university alone. It may be
                    undertaken in co–operation with other agencies of the State. Some State Historical
                    Societies have direct State connection and support. Where they have not the State should be
                    encouraged to establish a permanent historical commission which should perform for the State one of
                    its most sacred duties—the collection, preservation and publication of the
                    State's archives and documentary history. I mean, of course, not monographic productions
                    nor any one's account of any movement or event, but the letters, correspondence, messages,
                    documents and other materials from which the history of the State may be studied and written. To
                    such a commission the State University, or any university or college within the State, should lend
                    its consistent aid and co–operation. And the commission through State appropriations
                    should aid the university by making available to the public the edited documents and such worthy
                    monographs as the historical workers of the university may be able to produce.</p>

                    fevers were the common lot of all. There was a heavy growth of timber along the weeks running
                    through the level stretch upon which the village was located. Much of the land was so low that it
                    was subject to annual overflow. This half–marsh, covered with fallen and decayed timber,
                    caused much sickness among the early settlers. So, it was no uncommon thing for the "older
                    settlers" to advise the "newcomers" to move back among the hills
                    surrounding this valley near the river, where they would be out of the reach of floods and impending
                    sickness.</p>
            <p>Soon after the war of 1812, emigrants came, in ever increasing numbers, to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Falls country. Among these were several French families from Lorraine who floated down
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river; and upon landing at New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and being informed of its unhealthful condition, turned to the hills northwest of the
                    village. These hills were covered with the forest primeval, and the only means of climbing them,
                    doubtless, was by following the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Buffalo</settlement>
                    </placeName> trail, long before abandoned by its makers. This probably led the French emigrants
                    north of the present Paoli pike, for they settled on Little Indian creek, some two or three miles
                    north of the present village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mooresville</settlement>
                    </placeName> (Floyd Knob P. O.), and about six miles from New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The exact location of the old trail is not known. It may have been nearer the line of
                    the Paoli pike, from <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-011-1-071"/> which it was easy for the settlers to
                    follow the course of the creek. Here they laid the nucleus for the flourishing community known today
                    as St. Mary's–of–the–Knobs.</p>
            <p>Among these earliest settlers (they were proud to be settlers, and not squatters) was one Thomas
                    Piers—often called Pierce— an Irishman, who came in 1816. He was a man of
                    considerable influence, a surveyor as well as a farmer. On his farm the first Catholic church was
                    organized by Father Abel of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bardstown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <country reg="kyu"> Kentucky </country>
                    </placeName>. A log church was built in 1824. This church was replaced by a brick building in 1836,
                    and located about a mile north of the first structure. However, the graveyard around the first
                    church continued to be held sacred for many years, and has only recently become a part of the
                    cultivated fields. In 1824 there was no Catholic church in New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the small congregation out on the Piers farm was recognized as a mission of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bardstown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the priests coming from that town to conduct services for the settlers. At that time
                    the bishop lived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Constant communication was kept up between the churches at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bardstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> along the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Buffalo</settlement>
                    </placeName> trail. As the priests traveled through the state they made it a point to visit all
                    Catholic families and settlements. Thus the little church on the Floyd county hills had many passing
                    visitors from its earliest days.</p>
            <p>Many Frenchmen and a few Irish, led by the ties of kindred, language, and religion, followed the
                    first hardy pioneers. Among these were the names: Vernia (then spelled Vernier), Albert, Banet,
                    Spikert, Jacquot, Pierette, Brevet, Peay, Perrine, Quencez, Beau–cond, Richards, Pierson,
                    Bedan (spelled Bedaine), Didat, Journey, Martin, James (Jarques), Wey, Receveur, Choulet, Christian,
                    Mar–guet, Tripure and many others.</p>
            <p>The best known of the Irish settlers in the neighborhood were the Byrn, Duffy and Coleman families.
                    John Coleman was one of the best educated men in the colony, and became the first schoolmaster. He
                    was also a justice of the peace, and tried the few cases.</p>
            <p>These early settlers were frugal and industrious. They brought with them their occupations of the
                    "old country," and lived the simple peasant life of the fatherland. The older
                    people, even within the memories of those now living, wore wooden shoes (sabots), and burned their
                    "fagots." The settlement prospered, and the farms grew apace. One of my family
                    remembers seeing the women of those "early days" mounted astride horses coming to
                    market with <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-011-1-072"/> the fruits of their fields in bags across the
                    horses' backs. In New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> they exchanged their produce for such articles as sugar and coffee, mounted their
                    steeds, and rode leisurely away to their hilly homes. As they cleared their fields for cultivation,
                    they used the timber and hoop–poles for making barrels. Thus early the cooperage business
                    became one of the leading industries of the community. They sold these barrels in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, hauling them in immense wagons built for that purpose. A descendant of one of the
                    early French families, a woman not yet in middle life, has told me that she recalls four large
                    "cooper shops" in her immediate neighborhood, when she was a child. The merry
                    sound of the hammer was heard in all directions. Now they are all gone. The clearing away of the
                    forests, and the introduction of factory–made barrels at a much cheaper price caused the
                    decline of this old time industry.</p>
            <p>Another paying industry of the early French settlement was the stone quarrell which gave occupation
                    to a goodly number of men. These men had to be strong, robust, and fearless, for the work was
                    considered quite dangerous. But the boy who secured the job of carrying drinking water from a
                    near–by well or spring to the "quarrymen," as they were called, thought
                    he had an easy task indeed, and there was great competition for the same, as the occupation gave
                    much time for rest and reflection. Logs were in plenty from which he could shy stones at passing
                    birds, and gaze at the beautiful scenery, a panorama of hills, valleys, and distant towns spread out
                    before him; and no doubt he took advantage of the situation. The limestone rocks, after being
                    blasted from the hillsides, were drilled by hand into huge blocks, and hauled in strong wagons,
                    called "rock wagons" to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they assisted largely in building that beautiful city.</p>
            <p>These occupations of farming, cooperage and quarrying created a social caste system among the early
                    settlers, the two former being considered much more genteel than the last named. This community,
                    known as "St. Mary's," early became one of the most flourishing in the
                    county and remains so to the present day. Many descendants of those pioneers are still living in the
                    county and State, and they are everywhere honored and respected citizens. And the church so early
                    founded at St. Mary's was like the community a strong and influential society. It grew with
                    the growth of the settlement, and strengthened with its strength, until it is now one of the largest
                    of the State outside the cities.</p>
            <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-011-1-073"/>
            <p>The church at St. Mary's had no resident priest until 1835, when Father Neyron came to them.
                    This Rev. Father deserves more than passing mention. He was a soldier of Napoleon's army,
                    also a surgeon of remarkable ability. Coming to this country early in the nineteenth century, he
                    became a priest, and his name is closely linked with the early history of New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to which place he came when the first Catholic church was organized. He was a public
                    spirited citizen as well as a religious worker, and he was ever ready with his surgeon's
                    skill to help those in need. He worked hand in hand with his followers, teaching them many useful
                    things. He built churches with his own means, and "healed the sick without money or
                    price." An elderly merchant in New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> relates that as a mere boy he used to accompany Father Neyron from the village
                    church—after early mass—across the fields and up the hills to St.
                    Mary's where the Rev. Father would hold services at 10 a. m., returning to New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> immediately afterward, always afoot. So it is easily seen why the name of Father Neyron
                    is held in blessed memory by those old settler folk.</p>
            <p rend="center">
                    <hi rend="sc">"FRENCH CREEK" SETTLEMENT</hi>
                </p>
            <p>Southwest of New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> lies a mass of hills, picturesque, rugged and barren in many places. There is but
                    little level land, and the country is wild and rough in general. The main road through this part of
                    the county, winding, curving and doubling on itself among these beautiful hills, is called the Budd
                    road in honor of Col. Gilbert Budd, an influential English pioneer, who settled early in that
                    community. A French colony, led by a missionary priest, whose name has long since passed into
                    oblivion, settled among these hills about 1830 or thereabouts. They may have been led in that
                    direction in search of higher, healthier ground, as in the case of the first settlement, or the
                    hills may have reminded them of their far–away homes. At any rate they called their
                    settlement "Porrentruy" from the name of the native canton of many of them. On the
                    books of "La Societe Francaise" of New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, incorporated by act of Assembly in 1855, the division known as
                    "Porrentruy" is formally entered. Quite a number of these settlers were
                    "Belgian" French, and a few Swiss were mixed with them. Among these hills they
                    planted vineyards, vegetable gardens, and orchards. The people were honest and industrious and for
                    years the colony <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-011-1-074"/> prospere. In all about forty families settled
                    within a radius of a few miles up and down French creek, a creek that rushes and tumbles down the
                    hills to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and marked the heart of the settlement, its main thoroughfare as it were.</p>
            <p>Being much nearer the town than the settlement at St. Mary's, the people attended church at
                    New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It is said that Father Neyron persuaded them to come to him rather than build a church
                    of their own. Once each month the good Father was accustomed to go down among these parishioners,
                    and hold vesper services for them. A resident of New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who lived in this settlement when a boy, relates that on Sunday the older people would
                    drive the mile or two to New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> to church, while the young people preferred to walk, every laddie with his lassie, and
                    to make the trip as long as possible. It is said that when the community was at its prime, about
                    1850–60, there were at least a hundred young people in the neighborhood who enjoyed many
                    good times together.</p>
            <p>Among the names prominent in the community were Verone, Hubler, Bee, Pierard, Hubbard, Volzer,
                    Marque, Prenat, Boll, Be–zot, Gony, <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo"> Jordan </country>
                    </placeName>, Bruet, Mousty, Goniat, Graniger, Bezy, Echo–bert and Beuchat. Several of
                    the oldest settlers had been soldiers of Napoleon, and never tired of telling stories of their early
                    adventures.</p>
            <p>Several causes may have led to the downfall of the colony. The land is steep and sterile, and farming
                    does not prosper. There was no church with a resident priest to hold the people together. Many of
                    the young folks, influenced by the spirit of the times, went to the neighboring towns to work. Many
                    of the best families moved to other parts of the state, several settled at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. And, again, intermarriage with the incoming Americans resulted in the deterioration of
                    the pure French stock.</p>
            <p>During the '80's and '90's, the Budd Road French Settlement
                    became a most notorious place for evil doings. Many murders were committed, and the spirit of feuds
                    was rampant. It was with much difficulty that the county authorities were able to suppress this
                    lawlessness.</p>
            <p>However, at present, a generation has grown up that is hardworking and law–abiding. The
                    old "reign of terror" has passed away with the older generation. Likewise most of
                    the old landmarks of the early French settlement have disappeared. Here and there are found the
                    remains of an old vineyard on some steep hillside. <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-011-1-075"/> In one place
                    an old chimney looms above the neighboring scrub–oaks, a mute witness of the past. On
                    another hillside a pile of stones, mostly covered with vines and lichens, is all that remains of a
                    huge bake oven, the common property of several neighbors. Here and there a disused well, its sweep
                    and bucket long since fallen to decay, marks the spot of an old French home. These, together with a
                    few names such as "French Creek," "French Creek School," are all
                    that remain of the once nourishing and picturesque community.</p>
            <p>It seems the irony of fate that these two French settlements— "St.
                    Mary's" and the "Budd Road"—in the same small county,
                    and within a few miles of each other, should have had such different endings, one to have prospered
                    with the years, and the other to have gone to pieces utterly. Be it as it may, they have added much
                    to the interest and romance of the early history of Floyd county. True to their native
                    characteristics, they give a dash, and a bit of color to our early local history that would be
                    entirely lacking without them.</p>

                    bloodiest battlefields of the war. In November, 1864, Captain Howe was mustered out of service on

                    Indiana and the political history of his country, and while attending to his judicial duties or
                    carrying on active legal practice, he has also carried to completion his enterprises in authorship,
                    and after many years of exhaustive reading and labor he has made in this new volume a contribution
                    to American political history which will win for him further distinction and praise.</p>
            <p>The volume under review is an exhaustive study of the great controversy over slavery and states
                    rights which finally led to disunion and Civil War in 1861. The author traces the early opinions and
                    differences on slavery in the' several States; the early doctrines on state rights and
                    state sovereignty in New <placeName>

                    the various political campaigns and heated discussions that led up to the Mexican War while slavery
                    was fast becoming the dominant subject in party contests.</p>
            <p>Much the larger part of the volume is taken up with the period from 1850 to 1860—one of
                    the most vital periods in American history. In the treatment of Seward's speech on the
                    corpromise measures <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-011-1-078"/> of 1850, the author traces the origin of the
                    "higher law" doctrine back through the "Liberty men" to the
                    speech of Lord Brougham in the House of Commons in 1830 in which Brougham rejects the "wild
                    and guilty phantasy that man can hold property in man." Judge Howe very properly regards
                    these compromises as "a temporary plaster that for a time covered but did not heal the
                    sore," and as but "a lull in the storm." The radical Southern leaders
                    like William L. Yancey were spreading and cultivating the seed of secession by speeches, letters,
                    and such State platforms as those adopted in <placeName>
                        <country reg="alu"> Alabama </country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau"> Georgia </country>
                    </placeName>. Yancey and Toombs were thus firing the "Southern heart" for the
                    revolution when the time came to be ripe. Judge Howe's adverse estimate of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pierce is forceful and must be said to be a fair historic judgment: "Sometimes <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in ordering the affairs of the universe, puts a very small man in a very great place,
                    where he is suddenly confronted with great opportunities, great responsibilities, and great events
                    which he has neither the capacity to understand nor the ability to grapple with and which by their
                    very bigness make his own littleness the more conspicuous. Such a man was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pierce. He was accidentally, as it seems to mankind, placed in the presidential
                    chair." The author holds that Pierce was controlled by Jefferson Davis throughout his
                    administration and he relates that when the Union soldiers captured the home of Davis in 1865, among
                    the treasures there they found a letter from Pierce to Davis, under date of January 6, 1860, in
                    which Pierce gives the Southern leader the assurance that, "if, through the madness of
                    Northern Abolitionism that dire calamity (disunion) must come, the fighting will not be along <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Mason</region>
                    </placeName> and Dixon's line merely, it will be within our own borders, in our own
                    streets. Those who defy the law and scout constitutional obligations will, if we ever reach the
                    arbitrament of arms, find occupation enough at home." A great national adviser to the
                    people was this little ex–President! Of Buchanan, Judge Howe shows by Southern authority
                    that "he never gave a vote against the interest of slavery and never uttered a word which
                    could pain the most sensitive Southern heart." Yet Judge Howe quotes, and apparently
                    approves John Sherman and ex–President Andrew D. White to the effect that
                    Buchanan's election, or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s defeat, in 1856 was a blessing to the country. It may have been so. Judge
                    Howe was not a voter in that fateful year but if he had been, it is doubtful, even with the
                    hindsight that <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-011-1-079"/> has come with the passage of the years, whether
                    if he had to cast a ballot amid the pending struggle for free soil in 1856, he would still not vote
                    for the "Pathfinder of the Rockies." It would depend, perhaps, upon whether one
                    thought most of saving the union or of restricting the area of human slavery. It is by such
                    interesting and suggestive extracts, sources, and sidelights, that Judge Howe adds to the
                    significance of the struggles and controversies of which he tells.</p>
            <p>The author brings into view the sore friction over the fugitive slave and the attempt at
                    nullification of the national law in the North for the sake of the escaping slave; the struggle in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> and popular sovereignty as it was seen in action; the "crime against <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>" and the assault on Sumner; the birth of the Republican party and its first
                    battles for the principle of the Wilmot Proviso; the Dred Scott case and its far–reaching
                    effects; Seward and the "irrepressible conflict;" the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>–Douglas debates; John Brown and his influence; the campaign of 1860 and the
                    exciting and bitter discussions of Buchanan's closing months which led to the final
                    rupture. It is doubtful if there is another decade in the life of America that has produced so much
                    in the way of a vital dramatic struggle as the one of which this volume treats. It is an era
                    surcharged with human interest, a period in which great men of great minds struggled for mastery in
                    the forum. Judge Howe's pages show that in his study of this decade, his reading has been
                    voluminous and his use of the sources varied and extensive, while his vivid presentation makes a
                    very readable and instructive volume. He fought in the ranks as an Indiana soldier against the
                    South, that is against secession and disunion, but he writes history as an American, without any
                    sectional bitterness and with a manly recognition of the courage, devotion and integrity of the
                    Southern people and of the Southern soldiers who sacrificed so much for thf.ir cause. He does not
                    "give away" the Northern cause and the national view by unnecessary and
                    uncalled–for concession, but he treats the view opposed to his own with fairness and
                    respect.</p>
            <p>The men of the time come into review like real and living combatants in the arena, Toombs and
                    Stephens, Davis, Foote, and Cobb, and Hunter and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>, and Breckinridge from the South; Douglas, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Seward, Sumner, Webster, Cass, Chase, and others, of different political parts and
                    complexion, from the North. The part that each played in the great struggle is set forth without <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-011-1-080"/> bias or partisan passion. A judicial historian's
                    estimate of any of the great men of that great era is always a matter of interest. Judge
                    Howe's estimate of Stephen A. Douglas, concluding his chapter on the campaign of 1860, may
                    be offered as a typical passage showing the style and quality of our author's work: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Looking back now over a period of more than fifty years, the picture of Douglas stands out in
                            bold relief. For some years after the passage of the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                            </placeName>–<placeName>

                            </placeName> act, he was looked upon by a large portion of the people of the North with
                            distrust, and by many with aversion. Before the end of the presidential campaign they saw
                            another <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                            </placeName> in the field. It was indeed the same man who had been so largely instrumental
                            in securing the passage of the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>

                            </placeName> act, but he himself had changed. In all the strange evolutions of American
                            politics, nothing is stranger than the political transformation of Douglas. From a staunch
                            ally of the slaveholding interests of the South, he had become their most courageous and
                            determined antagonist. And when the crisis came with the firing on Fort Sumter, his attitude
                            was that of unswerving and uncompromising loyalty to the Union. He will be remembered in
                            future history, not for his record as a politician, but for his services as a patriot. If he
                            had been loyally supported by the Buchanan administration, and by the southern Democratic
                            leaders, he would probably have been elected over <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                            </placeName>. Possibly he might have been elected notwithstanding the opposition of the
                            southern leaders if he had received the support of the Buchanan administration.</p>
                        <p>What might have been the result if he had been elected is now only a matter of speculation.
                            It is certain, however, that neither Douglas nor any other man could have reconciled the
                            advocates and the opponents of the extension of slavery. Perhaps the election of Douglas
                            might, for a time, have prolonged the Union, but it would also have given slavery a new
                            lease of life, and as long as slavery continued it would have been a disturbing factor in
                            politics and a menace to peace. It was impossible, as <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                            </placeName> had said, for the country to endure permanently half free and half slave. It
                            must become all one or all the other. The South would never willingly have consented
                            to' its being all free and the North would never have consented to its being all
                            slave. No peacemaker, no Supreme Court decision, no compromise could effect a lasting peace
                            between Freedom and Slavery, and, without the entire reconstruction of the Union itself,
                            there was but one way in which the slavery question could be finally settled and that was by
                            the old method of wager of battle.</p>

                    </placeName>" shows with what eager expectancy the country awaited the announcement of the
                    new President's policy —an untried man whom Southern writers were heralding to
                    the country as the "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> ape." The author indicates the reversal of <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-011-1-081"/>
                    this judgment in Southern opinion in better days and traces the triumph of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s wisdom and public policies in the early months of his trying administration.
                    The story of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s early public days is full of interest. In fact, there is not an
                    uninteresting page in the volume.</p>
            <p>The appearance of this book adds to the prestige of Indiana authorship. Judge Howe has brought honor
                    to the State. His book will be recognized as one of high merit throughout the country. It would
                    interest and instruct any general reader who wishes to be informed on the subject with which it
                    deals, while students and scholars in colleges and universities will find it valuable in the course
                    of their studies in American history. It is likely to be found soon in all our college and
                    university libraries and every public library in Indiana ought to see to it that its patrons have
                    easy access to its pages. This volume is not expected to be one of the "best
                    sellers," but there ought to be enough serious–minded readers in America
                    interested in this great drama of our history and enough Indiana appreciation of such a work to
                    bring to its author approval and encouragement.</p>
            <p>Judge Howe's services as President of the Indiana Historical Society should be better known
                    to the people of the State. Much of what the Society has accomplished in recent years for Indiana
                    history has been owing to the faithfulness and efficiency of its president. The society has had very
                    little State support. What has been done has been done by a few under Judge Howe's
                    leadership, whose zeal has been unfailing. He deserves to be recognized as one of the worthy sons of
                    the State who have helped to make and at the same time have helped to preserve the history of
                    Indiana. He is not much in the public eye and the masses of his fellow–citizens may
                    seldom hear his name. They may pass by unknowing and unheedful of his services and his work. But a
                    hundred years from now, and after, when the names of many who are now in public office or in public
                    comment have long since been forgotten, Judge Howe's name and his work will be known in the
                    annals of his State and he will be listed as one of the Indiana worthies who have added something of
                    lasting value to the life and honor of his native State. He has labored not with an eye to fame but
                    with an eye to the greater verities and to the more permanent values.</p>
            <p>There are many kinds of benefactions to the State. In his <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-011-1-082"/>
                    writings and his collections Judge Howe's benefaction takes high rank. He will have his
                    reward. It will not be in the applause of the multitude, but he will have the lasting appreciation
                    of at least a few who will know and understand what his labors of love have brought in benefits not
                    only to his day and generation but to the generations that are yet to come.</p>

                                    Society of Colonial Dames of America in the State of Indiana," dealing with
                                    the work undertaken by the Society for the Preservation of Existing Records : to
                                    wit, oldest town and church records, family records in old Bibles, as well as the
                                    location of the oldest graveyards in the State and a report of their condition.
                                    Through the medium of your M<hi rend="sc">AGAZINE</hi> the "Colonial
                                    Dames" interested several persons in the search but as the work undertaken
                                    is far from completion it is the hope of the Dames that the societies and
                                    individuals interested in the preservation of the early history of the State may at
                                    this time come to their assistance with additional information concerning records
                                    desired.</p>
                        <p>Besides the work undertaken by the National Society with which the Indiana Society is

                                    shall be to collect and classify all American Samplers, and to supply the demand
                                    which seems a real one for a book on American Samplers, fully illustrated.</p>
                        <p>The "Indiana Society" has been asked to assist in the work of the "<placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                                    </placeName> Society" and it appeals in this way to the citizens of the
                                    State for information about Samplers made prior to 1815, bearing the name of the
                                    maker and the date when they were worked. Already several samplers have been found
                                    and a description of them may be of interest to your readers.</p>
                        <p>The first, owned by Mrs. John B. Holton, <placeName>

                        <p>The third is owned by Mrs. Davis C. Buntin, of <placeName>

                        <p>These examples will give an idea of what is wanted for the book on American Samplers,
                                    materials for which is now being collected. It is the hope of the Committee

            </p>
            <p>Indiana has been backward in commemorating in pictorial art the great men and events of her history.
                    Therefore the work of the Indiana Society of Sons of the Revolution in having painted a fine large
                    oil portrait (7x3 feet in dimensions) of General George Rogers Clark is noteworthy, both as a
                    precedent for other patriotic and historical societies and as an example of painstaking care in
                    securing an artistic and comparatively accurate reproduction of the features, figure and dress of an
                    historical character. The portrait was painted by Otto Stark, who, assisted by the chairman of the
                    portrait committee of the Sons, made studies of the Jarvis and Jouet portraits of Clark and sought
                    descriptions of him in the literature of the period. Clark is not represented at the early age, 26,
                    when he captured <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but in middle life. The figure is standing, full length, and is clad in the
                    general's uniform of the period, with a long military cloak draped from the shoulders,
                    making a handsome and striking picture. This is the only oil portrait of General Clark in Indiana,
                    except one of unknown origin and <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-011-1-088"/> authenticity at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University. It is also the finest portrait of Clark, artistically, in existence.</p>
            <p>The unveiling of the portrait occurred at the annual dinner of the Sons at the Claypool Hotel, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, October 19, 1914. In his address presenting the portrait to the Society, William Allen
                    Wood, chairman of the portrait committee, recalled that the "particular purpose"
                    of the Indiana Society of Sons of the Revolution is to perpetuate "the memory of the men
                    who, in military, naval and civil service of the Colonies and of the Continental Congress, by their
                    acts or counsel, achieved the Independence of Our Country"; that General Clark and his
                    soldiers were the only connection of Indiana with the Revolutionary War, and that, therefore, it is
                    particularly appropriate that the Sons, a Revolutionary society, should perpetuate the likeness and
                    memory of this hero in a beautiful painting. Mr. Wood said that this portrait is meant as the
                    contribution of the Indiana Sons to the centennial celebration of the admission of Indiana as a
                    State and that the portrait will be hung in the State House and elsewhere, as the board of managers
                    of the Sons may determine. However, it will remain the property of the Society and will be cared for
                    by the Society. It was accepted on behalf of the Society by Judge John S. Tarkington, the retiring
                    president. The other members of the portrait committee were Judge Robert W. McBride and Charles F.
                    Remy.</p>

            <p>John S. Duncan, sixty–nine years old, a lawyer in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for forty–seven years and considered as one of the ablest advocates at the

                    </placeName> street.</p>
            <p>Mr. Duncan was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> January 11, 1846, and this city was his home throughout his life. He graduated from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> Law School and early in 1867 he was admitted to the practice of law in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName> Courts. He had been engaged in the law practice less than a year when Governor Morton
                    appointed him as prosecuting attorney to fill the unexpired term of W. W. Leathers, who had
                    resigned. At the expiration of his commission he was elected to serve a full term as prosecutor. He
                    never held public office after this, his political activity in later life being limited to the
                    making of campaign speeches in behalf of the Republican Party, with which he was affiliated. He was
                    an earnest supporter of Benjamin Harrison when he was a candidate for President.</p>
            <p>As a prosecuting attorney Mr. Duncan achieved success and he <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-011-1-092"/>
                    attracted attention throughout the state by his prosecution of the famous Clem murder case. In the
                    prosecution of this case he was assisted by Gen. Benjamin Harrison, William P. Fishback and John T.
                    Dye.</p>
            <p>He soon became noted both in the prosecution and defense of important criminal cases. For a period of
                    twenty years he participated in practically all the noted criminal cases tried in many counties of
                    the State. While he was best known as a criminal lawyer he also had a big practice in the trial of
                    civil cases.</p>
            <p>When he first began his practice, Mr. Duncan became a partner of his father, Robert B. Duncan, who
                    had been clerk of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName> Circuit Court for nearly thirty years and who was regarded as an authority on probate
                    law. The firm was known as that of R. B. and J. S. Duncan until 1877 when Charles W. Smith became a
                    member of it. After several years the senior Mr. Duncan retired from the practice. Later John R.
                    Wilson, a brother–in–law of Mr. Duncan, became a member of the firm, remaining
                    as such until 1899 when he was elected clerk of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName> Circuit Court. After that the partnership was known as Duncan &amp; Smith until
                    about 1896 when Henry H. Hornbrook, a son–in–law of Mr. Smith, was added to
                    the firm. Later, Albert P. Smith, a son of Charles W. Smith, entered the firm.</p>
            <p>In 1864 Mr. Duncan, then 18 years old, enlisted in the Union army as a member of the One Hundred and
                    Thirty–second Indiana Regiment. His service, however, was for only 100 days and he was
                    not engaged in any battle.</p>
            <p>Mr. Duncan was first married December 24, 1867, to Esther Wallace, a daughter of William Wallace, who
                    was a son of Governor David Wallace and a brother of Gen. Lew Wallace. Mrs. Duncan died February 18,
                    1902. His second wife was Mrs. Perlie E. Haynes, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Their marriage took place November 16, 1907. Mr. Duncan's mother, who was
                    Mary Saunders, was a daughter of Dr. John Saunders, who was for many years one of the leading
                    physicians of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>From his boyhood Mr. Duncan had been a member of the Central Christian church. He was a member of the
                    official board of the church for many years. He had no affiliation with a secret society.</p>
            <p>Besides his widow, Mr. Duncan is survived by a daughter, Mrs. Charles M. Malott, and a sister, Mrs.
                    John R. Wilson.</p>

            <head>THE "READINGS IN INDIANA HISTORY"—<hi rend="sc">SOME CRITICISMS</hi>

            <p>This M<hi rend="sc">AGAZINE</hi> and the "Extension Department" of the University
                    have received a number of highly appreciative expressions concerning the <hi rend="i">Readings in

                    the History Section of the State Teachers' Association. A number of schools have ordered
                    copies of this book and there is evidence that it has done a good deal to promote interest in and
                    knowledge of Indiana in our school life. We are pleased to be able to print this good letter from
                    Judge Daniel Waite Howe, President of the Indiana Historical Society, written to Professor Woodburn:</p>

                        <p>My Dear Friend:</p>
                        <p>I received on last Saturday the volume of <hi rend="i">Readings in Indiana
                                    History</hi> for which I wish to thank you and the Publication Committee. I have
                                    already read a large part of the volume with great interest. It is at once apparent
                                    that an immense amount of time and labor has been expended in getting this
                                    collection together. Its value is equally apparent. It will stimulate in the
                                    schools, a new interest in the study of Indiana History, make our children and our
                                    children's children realize the fact that Indiana has a history, a history
                                    to be proud of, and impress them with a desire to know more about it.</p>
                        <p>It will furnish the future historians of Indiana with valuable material. Most
                                    persons, even those familiar with the method of making historical investigations,
                                    would be at a loss to know where to look for much of the information here collected
                                    in compact and convenient form, and the difficulty of searching for it would be
                                    largely increased by the fact that so many of the authorities are practically
                                    inaccessible to those who do not know just where to find them.</p>
                        <p>I hope that the present volume is only the precursor of others of a similar kind and
                                    that the next Indiana Legislature will make a suitable appropriation to aid the
                                    committee in its useful labors in behalf of the State.</p>
                        <p>Please express my warmest thanks to the members of the committee and especially to
                                    Mr. Esarey, assuring them that I, for one, at least, appreciate the value of their
                                    labors.</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir:</p>
                        <p>I am enjoying the <hi rend="i">Readings in Indiana History</hi>, which I believe was
                                    prepared by you. I congratulate you on the good work you are doing. May I make one
                                    suggestion? The early period from the settlement of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to the financial distress and the opening of the "New
                                    Purchase" was largely influenced by and from the Whitewater Country. That
                                    region from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to the National Road played a part in every important thing. <placeName>

                                    </placeName> was the head of immigration, it was the centre of activity in business,
                                    politics, etc., and was the point of diffusion to the new territory as rapidly as it

                        <p>It has seemed to me that this publication and some others do not get the right
                                    setting and do not have exactly the right point because of the omission of the many
                                    important relationships sustained by the Whitewater region to the settlement and
                                    development of the State.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps I would magnify that region too much and its part. I grew up there. My people
                                    came to it in 1803. I know its story. What do you think?</p>

                        <p>The children of today in our public school, In reading the editorial introduction to
                                    "The Slavery Contest in Indiana," will form the opinion that the
                                    majority of the people of Indiana in the fifties were opposed to the enforcement of
                                    the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 and resisted the efforts of the slave owners to
                                    recover their runaway slaves.</p>
                        <p>I think this is an erroneous statement of the facts as they existed in Indiana at
                                    that period. The Democratic Party was in the ascendant in the State, its members of
                                    Congress, both Senators and Representatives, were committed to the strict
                                    enforcement of the Fugutive Slave Law and the adherents of that party generally
                                    favored the recognition of the constitutional right of the slaveholders to their
                                    property in their slaves. The members of the Whig Party, then the minority party in
                                    Indiana, supported Henry Clay's compromise measures, including the Fugitive
                                    Slave Law. Only <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-011-1-096"/> a small band of people, known as
                                    Abolitionists, openly opposed this law and gave aid and secret protection to runaway
                                    slaves. The change which appeared in public sentiment after the passage of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                                    </placeName>–<placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                                    </placeName> Bill, was based upon opposition to the extension of slavery north of 36
                                    30', and had no relation to the Fugitive Slave Law, although the latter
                                    doubtless was repugnant to very many of the inhabitants.</p>

            <p>The above puzzle was placed before the reading public a few weeks ago. It is the title to one of the
                    most attractive books on Hoosier life and history which has appeared since the <hi rend="i">Hoosier
                        Schoolmaster</hi> was published. As the title implies, the author, presumably an old person,
                    tells his imaginary grandchildren of the times and conditions under which he grew up. The author
                    pretends to be, or to have been a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The author's home, though not definitely given, seems to have been about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plainfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The time is about the middle of the century. The author was quite a lad when the
                    railroad was finished to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Before that time his father frequently drove to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> to do the annual trading. The father was a man of some prominence, being well
                    acquainted with Governor Joseph A. Wright, then in office. The story would seem to cover the period
                    from about 1835 to 1852.</p>
            <p>For his subject matter the author takes the whole round of pioneer life. The hard work, the exposure,
                    the mean house, the poor roads, the hidebound routine, and the homely fare are matched with the
                    voracious appetites, the careless plodding, the country scenery, the sparkling fire, the warm though
                    ill–fitting clothes, and the rugged manly strength. The daily, weekly, or yearly grind of
                    duties loses its harshness when seen through the mists of memory. The superstitions and formalities
                    of the times and of the church and schools are sympathetically pointed out in a style mellowed by
                    the wide vision and broad tolerance of a green old age. The social life of the community, the house
                    raising, the log–rolling, the quilting the
                    Sunday–after–meeting–dinners, the circus, all these give an insight
                    into the life and character of the times. Woven into these details of home life is an intensely
                    amusing, matter–of–fact love <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-011-1-097"/> story, with
                    its attempted elopement and final formal marriage in the church. The whole is woven into a story
                    that refuses to be put off.</p>
            <p>The writer's style is easy and unnoticeable. He carries no detail to the point of
                    impatience, in fact he has a kind of Kipling way of breaking off and returning abruptly to the main
                    story when he feels that he has wandered some distance on a bypath. The story seems to be one that
                    will take its place along with the <hi rend="i">Hoosier Schoolmaster, Circuit Rider</hi> and the <hi rend="i">New Purchase</hi> as a portrayal of Hoosier life.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> is not different in general outline from that of other states of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley. First comes the struggle with the Indians, nowhere more romantic than in West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Then comes the story of the settlements, the clearing of the forest, the opening of
                    the farms, and the organization of society. The period following the settlement was characterized by
                    the struggle for roads, canals, turnpikes and navigable rivers.</p>
            <p>While the State was struggling with these problems and involved with the tidewater counties, the
                    catastrophe of the Civil War broke over the great State. The experience of West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> has not been repeated. No other State is the result of a rebellion, and no other State
                    government has been organized under such conditions as those in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> from 1861 to 1863.</p>
            <p>The book shows evidence of careful investigation. The historical data have been collected, arranged,
                    and organized with care. The divisions of the subject–matter show a keen insight and
                    appreciation of western history and character. In this part of the work <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-011-1-098"/> there is ample room for praise. But when one considers the style of
                    writing, the typography and the mechanical execution of the book he will have to search long for
                    anything that merits approval. The long involved sentences defy analysis or comprehension. Take for
                    illustration the last sentence on page 14. It extends through fourteen lines of print and has three
                    parenthetical remarks. Sentences eight and ten lines long are common. On the next page, 15, are two
                    sentences of eight lines each. It is hardly necessary to point out the frequent difficulties in
                    determining the exact meaning. On page 17 is the following sentence: "All these settlements
                    were at that time in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange county</region>
                    </placeName> (formed from Spottsylvania in 1734 which extended to the 'utmost limits of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>' including in its boundaries all of what is now West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>." Even had the parenthesis been completed and a few commas inserted it would
                    still have been difficult enough to interpret it.</p>
            <p>The proofreading seems to have been entirely neglected. A list of errata at the beginning points out
                    a few of the omissions, but only a few. On page 12, we find "Gualey" for Gauley
                    and "lead" for led or leads; on page 14, "slave's" for
                    slaves; on page 16, "Mechlenberg" for Mecklenberg. The list might be extended
                    indefinitely. These errors are not properly chargeable to the author and yet they detract largely
                    from the value and attractiveness of the book. There is a tendency to overstatement which often puts
                    a cautious reader on his guard. Take the following sentence from page 21: "The French with
                    their savage allies bore down with resistless fury upon the West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> border and around these primitive forts–were enacted many tragedies and
                    dramas of the –wilderness." One is tempted to question the
                    "resistlessness" of the fury and to wonder just what is the distinction between
                    the forest "tragedy" and "drama."</p>
            <p>The last half of the volume is taken up with a series of papers having no apparent value. It was
                    doubtless necessary for each member of the commission to get his name connected with the report. Had
                    the money spent on the whole book been spent in improving the historical part, the book would have
                    been far more. creditable. One can not help feeling that Professor Callahan was hampered in his work
                    by the commission. The organization, the division, and the general understanding of the
                    State's History by <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-011-1-099"/> the author are excellent beyond
                    question, and it is most unfortunate that such work was marred by the undue haste or lack of funds
                    for publication.</p>

                    Dunning. The first is "Deportation and Colonization," by Walter L. Fleming,

                    is "Grant's Southern Policy," written by Prof. Edwin C. Wooley, of the

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    </placeName>, and is entitled "Southern Politics Since the Civil War."</p>
            <p>The papers are uniformly well written. Though not of equal interest to all readers, each has a charm
                    and interest of its own. Each by itself is a readable essay while all taken together make a fairly
                    comprehensive history of the South since 1850. Professor Dunning has long been recognized as the
                    foremost authority on the period of American History known as Reconstruction. These essays will not
                    only contribute to his reputation in that field but add to his reputation as a teacher. Nothing
                    could better show the wide influence of a great teacher than such a volume. In typography and
                    mechanical execution in general the book is faultness.</p>

            <p>The text–book problem will never be solved. The perfect text must have, a due regard for
                    the pupils who use it, for the canons of pedagogy, for the facts of the subject–matter,
                    for the demands of literature, and for the spirit of the times. A new departure in any of these
                    fields is fatal to the written text–book, and since no one of these factors is fixed,
                    changes come often, necessitating frequent changes in texts. Like Caesar's lieutenant, a
                    restless publisher frequently reports a change where none exists merely for the sake of selling a
                    new book. Mr. Page has availed himself of the latest work in historical research on the one hand and
                    has thrown more emphasis on recent history on the other, both of which are valuable novelties in his
                    text. In the way of pedagogy and interest he has made two valuable innovations. He has preserved the
                    narrative all the way through and has illustrated it with nearly 200 maps and engravings. Not only
                    the number but the vividness and historical accuracy of the illustrations are noteworthy.
                    Black–letter paragraph heads and marginal notes help to preserve the narrative and serve
                    as an analysis of the text. A few suggestive questions or topics for discussion are appended to each
                    chapter but no long and generally useless bibliography is printed. It is an admirable volume for
                    school use and should find a wide patronage.</p>

            <p>In 1895 the United Presbyterian Church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> celebrated its eighty–fifth anniversary. A number of papers, historical in
                    character, were read on that occasion. It was resolved at the time to have these published in book
                    form but nothing was done beyond collecting and preserving the papers. In 1910 the centennial of the
                    church was celebrated. On this occasion other historical addresses were delivered and were added to
                    the collection already in the hands of the committee.</p>
            <p>The church was founded by Rev. John Kell. The committee was able to include in its volume portraits
                    of each of the nine pastors except the founder. It is rather remarkable that the church should have
                    had only nine pastors in a century, an average of over eleven years each. Rev. John McMaster served
                    from 1846 to 1874. His father, Gilbert McMaster, preceded him, having served from 1840 to 1846;
                    while his son, W. H. McMaster, followed him, serving from 1874 to 1881. Father, son, and grandson
                    thus served the church continuously from May 5, 1840, to November 15, 1881.</p>
            <p>The congregation built its first small log church in 1820. In 1836 this gave way for a square,
                    one–story brick. In 1858 a more pretentious building with steeple and pointed windows was
                    erected. Finally, in 1898, through the generosity of Mrs. Ann Eliza Woods Hudelson, the present
                    building was constructed. Cuts of these churches are included in the centennial volume.</p>

                    Legislative Information. It was issued December, 1914. The booklet of 36 pages deals in a general
                    way with the forms, limitations and general requirements of legislative bills. First, the powers and
                    fields of legislation reserved exclusively by Congress are pointed out. Second, are enumerated those
                    powers which are exercised concurrently by State and Nation. Third, are those specifications laid
                    down by the State Constitution, without which the bill if enacted will be unconstitutional. Fourth
                    and last, under the headings of "Style" are some general directions, such as
                    dividing the bill into paragraphs, writing proper headings, or captions, preamble, emergency

                    division of the field between them; and after several friendly discussions it seemed best that they
                    should call a meeting of the persons directly in charge of the publication work in the various
                    states equally interested to discuss a still larger question, namely, the possibility of one general

                    meeting before the holidays. Professor Gipson took for his subject "The Influence of Thomas
                    Paine in the American Revolution." The speaker accorded Paine a high place among the
                    leaders of that movement. He pointed out that the odium that later attached to Paine's name
                    was caused by his activities and writings in connection with the French Revolution. The Club was
                    pleased to have Professor Gipson as its guest and a large crowd was out to enjoy his address.</p>

            <p>In the <hi rend="i">Volta Review</hi> of September, 1914, is a brief biography of Captain Foster,
                    known locally as the "Flag man," from his great interest in the National Flag.
                    Captain Foster is deaf as a result of exposure in the Civil War. A full page portrait accompanies
                    the biography.</p>

                    prisoner. It is worth while to point out that neither picture represents any historical fact, and
                    both are unjust to the character of the Indian chief.</p>
