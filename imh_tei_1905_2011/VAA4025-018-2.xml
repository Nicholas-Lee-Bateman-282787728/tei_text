                    </placeName>, one of the smallest and poorest counties of Indiana, lies nestled
                    among the hills of southern Indiana. The territory out of which the county was

                    of 1817-1818 which provided for the new county. Governor Jonathan Jennings
                    signed the bill on January 29, 1818. Much credit is due Senator Dennis
                    Pennington of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, cabinet officer and politician, who was a candidate for the
                    presidency in 1824. The county contains about 300 square miles. When it was
                    organized in 1818 the land was heavily forested. There were not much more than
                    two acres of swamp land in the whole county. The uplands were covered with oak,
                    hickory, gum, beech, poplar and walnut while the creek bottoms were covered with
                    sugar, elm, and sycamore. As a hunting-ground the county was not surpassed by
                    any in the state, while the streams of Big Blue, Little Blue, Turkey Fork, and
                    West Fork were the very best for fishing. The White Sulphur well at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, is unsurpassed by any spring of mineral water in the
                    country. The Marengb and Wyandotte caves are considered by some the most

                    wandering through the woods, now, one occasionally finds a pile of stones and
                    the evidence of some early home. Many old fruit trees, some still living and
                    others dead, are found scattered here and' there in the forests. This
                    indicates that the spot of land was at one time the seat of some
                    squatter's home. The five original townships into which the county was

                    connected with the name Whiskey Run. The story goes that down on the stream one
                    day an Indian named "Whiskey" killed a man named
                    "Run" who had a jug of whiskey with him. Then he <list type="footnotes">

            <p>After the original organization of the county four new townships were formed. The
                    boundaries of the old townships were changed too. In September, 1827, a large
                    tract of land was transferred from <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> was made. Liberty township was formed out of territory taken from
                    Sterling and Whiskey Run in December, 1842. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> township was carved out of <placeName>

                    </placeName> township on March 7, 1848. It was named after the Boones, one of
                    whom is buried on the hill near the town of Alton. The last township organized
                    was <placeName>

                    vice-presidency in 1864. So the people named the township <placeName>

                    </placeName>, from which several of the settlers came. The town was laid out in
                    section 33, township two south, range one east. This site is about four miles
                    southeast of the present town of English. The site of the town was a high hill,
                    hence the meaning of the word "Mount." Birney Labruk made the
                    plat of the town.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Thomas W. Aubrey, who was probably the

                    January 25, 1818, and acknowledged that plat to be the true plat of Mount
                    Sterling. Brice Patrick, who was the county agent, brought the plat to the
                    recorder's office and William Samuels recorded it November 11, 1818,
                    the drawing of which one may see in the first book in the recorder's
                    office on pages 2 and 3. A copy of the plat is submitted in the present writing.</p>
            <p>The town was located on the northeast quarter of section 33. The streets ran
                    north and south and east and west. The streets running north and south were
                    Carr, Biddle, Dock, Samuel, Hall, and Totton. They were sixty-five feet wide.

                    were held in 1818. A few old apple trees of the Horse apple variety were still
                    standing in 1900. In that year Henry Batman cleaned up and cultivated the old
                    field which had grown up in brambles years ago. He said the old apple trees were

                    </placeName> convened at Mount Sterling, August 1, 1818. Hon. Davis Floyd, Judge
                    Green, and James Glenn composed the court. Since there was no courthouse in
                    Mount Sterling then, James Brasher let the judges use his new log house. This
                    house was too small to accommodate all of the jurors, hence they sat around on
                    logs in the yard.</p>
            <p>Sheriff Daniel Weathers was present and returned the names of the following men
                    for a grand jury: Cornelius Hall, Lazarus Stewart, Alex King, William Osborn,
                    James Lewis, Elias Davis, Elisha Potter, Alex Barnett, William Potter, Robert

            </p>
            <p>These men elected Cornelius Hall foreman. After due consideration the jury
                    returned a bill against James Ouley for murder in the first degree. The evidence
                    showed that Ouley had followed William Briley through the woods for some
                    distance and had then shot him in the back about where his suspenders crossed.</p>
            <p>The ball came out in his neck making a wound about 8 inches deep. Briley died
                    almost instantly and Ouley escaped with his horse and about 75 cents in money.</p>
            <p>Briley lived near the present town of English. He had left home with a sack of
                    wool and was going to Corydon to get the wool carded. He was traveling on the
                    Governor's Old Trail which ran from Corydon to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The exact spot where the shooting occurred cannot now be located.

            <p>This act occurred July 1, 1818. Some men happened by and found Briley. They
                    started to carry him to his cabin over on Dog creek. After they had gone about
                    two miles they decided that they would bury him there. So a grave was dug and
                    the body was buried just as the men had found it. Briley had no person living
                    with him and Ouley might have escaped if he had hidden the body.</p>
            <p>The news spread rapidly and the whole community was aroused. The only evidence
                    then against Ouley was that he had disappeared from home that same day on which
                    the man Briley was killed and that some woman had seen him following Briley
                    through the woods.</p>
            <p>Jonathan Chambers and Zedekiah Lindley who were prominent men volunteered to
                    catch Ouley. These men had no warrant for his arrest but they were experts in
                    catching horse thieves and felt sure that they could catch Ouley if he could be
                    found anywhere.' So they traveled all over southern Indiana but did not
                    find him. They then crossed the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> near Mauckport
                    and began hunting for him in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Meade
                        county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. After a two weeks' tramp they came to
                    the town of Brandenburg and decided to give up the hunt and let him go. While
                    stopping at the tavern one day they saw men hauling cord wood into town. From
                    these men they learned that there was a wood cutter out in the forest who had
                    come there from Corydon a short time before. That night Chambers and Lindley
                    crept up and caught Ouley in his cabin. They brought him back to the old block
                    house near Marengo and chained him to the logs in the house and guarded him day
                    and night till the trial came off on the first day of August.</p>

            <p>The trial began at once. Ouley pleaded not guilty and demanded that the county
                    furnish him an attorney. The court appointed Henry Stephens and Harbin Moore to
                    defend while William Thompson was appointed prosecuting attorney for that
                    session of the court.</p>
            <p>Daniel Weathers, the sheriff, had a large number of men present from which these
                    men were selected for a petit jury: Elisha Lane, Constance Williams, Marcus
                    Troelock, Joseph Beals, Andrew Troelock, David Beals, John Goldman, James
                    Richie, William May, George Peckinpaugh, Thomas W. Cummins, and Robert Grimes.
                    Constance Williams was selected foreman of the jury.</p>
            <p>The trial was conducted out of doors in the woodyard. The jurors who were among
                    the best men in the county were sworn to hear the evidence and to decide the
                    case. After all the evidence was in and the court had instructed the jurors, the
                    jury retired to consider the evidence. After some time the jury returned a
                    verdict of guilty and placed his sentence at death.</p>
            <p>The counsel for defense asked for a new trial on these grounds: 1. That the
                    verdict was contrary to the etate law; 2. That the evidence was not sufficient;
                    3. The conduct of the jurors was not proper; 4. That outsiders talked to the
                    jurors during the trial; 5. That Elisha Lane had expressed his opinion before
                    the trial began; 6. That one of the jurors was too much indisposed to pay the
                    proper amount of attention that such a case demanded. The juror in question was
                    said to have been asleep.</p>
            <p>The court not being fully advised adjourned till the next day when it refused the
                    defendant a new trial and asked him if he had any further reason why sentence of
                    death should not be passed upon him. He asked the court to arrest the judgment
                    of the jurors on these grounds: 1. That he was a wheelright made the evidence
                    uncertain; 2. That the bill did not have the name of the state or county in
                        it.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    on a wagon and hauled out to the gallows. Six men with guns walked before the
                    wagon. Sheriff Samuel Clark had taken care to see that no confusion of any kind
                    occurred or any attempt to rescue the prisoner. Clark was so excited on this
                    occasion that when everything was ready he struck at the rope which held the
                    trap door on which he had put Fields and missed the rope. The second time he cut
                    the rope and let the prisoner fall. The rope broke but several men sprang
                    forward and helped the sheriff hold up the prisoner till the sheriff tied the

            <p>While Judge Floyd was holding the first session of the circuit court in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford county</region>
                    </placeName> and the good citizens at Mount Sterling were hanging Ouley, a new
                    town was laid out on the banks of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> by Allen
                    D. Thorn and Robert S. Thorn. These men had moved from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to Indiana and had finally located in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford county</region>
                    </placeName>. Allen D. Thorn made a plat of the town and filed it in the
                    recorder's office at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Corydon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, before the county seat was located at Mount Sterling.
                    William Samuels stated that Allen D. Thorn came before him personally and
                    acknowledged the plat to be the true plat of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The indenture was made June 22, 1818.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>The site where the town was laid out was one of the most picturesque of all river
                    towns. At this point the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> makes a great bend in
                    the shape of an ox-bow or a horse-shoe. Hence the bend was called the horse-shoe
                    bend. The river sweeps far northward into Indiana and then glides away gently to
                    the southward. Standing on the high bluff one can see as far up the river as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName> and down the river to Schooner Point. The tongue of land on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side is about three miles across in one place and probably
                    twenty-five miles around.</p>
            <p>From Indian Hollow to Schooner Point–a distance of 5
                    miles–the hill on the Indiana side is so precipitous that one cannot
                    build a road from the top of the bluff to the river except at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName> where a small creek runs down to tne river, up which was built a
                    wagon road over which freight could be hauled. This bluff is about 500 feet
                    high, many parts of which are almost perpendicular. On this high plateau Allen
                    D. Thorn and Robert S. Thom laid out the site for the town. The site, as already
                    stated, commanded a view <list type="footnotes">

                    many miles so that hostile Indians could not approach during the day without
                    being seen by the people of the town. The level land extended back from the
                    river bluff about one-half mile before the land became rough and hilly and
                    descended to <geogName>Little Blue river</geogName> on the west about two miles
                    away. The writer has copied a plat of the town and inserted it here facing this
                        page.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that time any man owning land and wishing to sell could lay out a town plat,
                    give the town some name and advertise the lots for sale. He had the plat
                    recorded in the county recorder's office. If many lots were sold a town
                    might grow up. In that case he could get more for his land than he could get if
                    he sold outright. Many men bought lots at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a town was soon started on that high hill. Plenty of good water
                    was found by digging several deep wells. Thorn's well was about 6 feet
                    in diameter and 86 feet deep. It stands full of good water the year around. The
                    well was walled from bottom to top, in most places with dressed stone. This
                    indicates that much work must have been done in its construction. The other two
                    wells were also very deep.</p>
            <p>One serious objection to the town of Mount Sterling was the absence of good
                    water. Creek water could not be used because of the danger from its impurity.
                    After the county seat was moved from Mount Sterling to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName> the General Assembly of the state of Indiana enacted a law
                    providing that the county seat must not be moved again under any condition
                    unless a good supply of drinking water was available.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Allen D. Thorn had a rich brother named Reuben T. Thom. At that time he was a
                    large land owner of the county. Of this land Allen D. Thom owned 80 acres, while
                    his brother owned the rest which amounted to about 1468 acres. Reuben Thom as
                    far as can be known never came to the county but remained at his home in

                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Hence he offered to give a tract of land on which a courthouse
                    might be built and a jail located. At that time no one had the right to move the
                    seat of justice from Mount Sterling. So James Glenn, who was a prominent citizen
                    of the county and an associate justice, sent a petition to Henry Green, who
                    represented the county in the General Assembly at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Corydon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, praying that the seat of justice be moved and that a committee be
                    appointed to locate a new seat. This petition being read November 21, 1821, was
                    referred to a select committee of which Green of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Crawford county</region>, <region type="county">Tipton</region>

                        <region type="county">Floyd county</region>
                    </placeName>, were members with permission to report by bill or otherwise. The
                    committee reported out a bill on November 30th which came up in the house on
                    December 2d and 7th and was passed Thursday, December 15, 1821. In the meanwhile
                    many petitions were sent to the General Assembly praying that the bill be
                    passed. For this reason one can say that the people in general approved of the
                    change of the county seat. After a few days in the committee the senate passed
                    the bill and the governor signed it. This provided that Sam Connor of <placeName>

                    seat of justice if the committee thought that it was beneficial to the people of
                    the county. The committee was to value the improvements made on the lots at
                    Mount Sterling and the cost of digging the public well. The state was to
                    compensate the men who had bought the lots in Mount Sterling up to the value of

            <p>Allen D. Thorn had this deed recorded December 15, 1822.</p>
            <p>The new courthouse which was a two-story brick, was about 39 feet long and 33
                    feet wide. The second story was used for a court room and the down stairs
                    provided rooms for the different county offices. Reuben Thorn's
                    contractors did a good piece of work in constructing the house which is still
                    standing. The upper story now has been cut lower and the ceiling of the first
                    story has been raised. The building is now used by the Methodists for a church.
                    The house has not been used for court purposes since 1843.</p>
            <p>The old jail which was rather small was a strong one. The house was built out of
                    hewn logs which were notched down well at the corners. Then the house was ceiled
                    by using hewn timbers about 10 inches wide and 4 inches thick. These timbers,
                    which were set vertically, were bolted to the logs. The floor and ceiling were
                    similarly constructed.</p>

            <p>As far as known only one person ever escaped from that old jail until is was
                    condemned, about 1840. The man who escaped was accused of horse stealing. He
                    secured an iron rod of some kind and burned his way out. It must have taken him
                    a long time. After he was out the man escaped into <placeName>

                    was guarded of nights when there were prisoners in it waiting trial.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> When the board doing county business met the first time
                    after the man escaped they ordered E. E. Morgan to have a new jail door made.
                    This new door was to be made of hewn timbers, the first laid lengthwise, then
                    the second set of timbers cross-wise and bolted to the first ones. Then the
                    third set of timbers was put lengthwise and bolted to the first two sets. This
                    made a door which was about one foot thick. The board granted to Mr. Morgan for:
                    doing the work and hanging the door the sum of $20.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>The location of the jail and courthouse is marked on the accompanying plot of the

            <p>The sheriff was not responsible for the prisoners in these early days. The board
                    doing county business generally appointed some man jailer and when the jail was
                    full with prisoners the jailer had several guards to help him keep them safe
                    till they were disposed of some way when court met. In 1827 Sam Clark, Ephraim
                    Conrad, Elias O'Bannon, Edward Martin and Richard Boyles were allowed
                    $2.50 each for helping guard the jail. Henry Conrad was appointed
                    jailer and pound master in 1831 and in 1837, respectively.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>When the new courthouse was ready the citizens of Fre-donia went to Mount

                        1822.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> At that time the books were put into sacks and
                    carried on horses. If the records were carried away by force, it was only the

            <p>The board doing county business in 1827 transferred a large tract of land from <placeName>

                    </placeName> begins then running north four miles, west six miles, south four
                    miles, and east six miles. This tract of land was added to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> township. Later in the same year 1827 the board of justices made a
                    new township which they called Union. This new township consists of the
                    congressional township three south, range one west, and six sections of the
                    congressional township two south, range one west.</p>

                    </placeName> Thom married his widow. He built a large two story frame house
                    under two giant locust trees on the edge of the river bluff. The old house
                    remained standing till 1918 when it was torn down. Part of the old foundation
                    may yet be seen. The old well out of which the writer has drunk is still used by
                    the people. Allen D. Thom was justice of peace for many years and road

                    of the 16th section of township four south, range one east, on January 3,
                        1825.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> In the same year he was asked to open a road 20

                    </placeName>. The point at issue was whether Seth Leavenworth should be elected

                    instead of canals. One may see the speech in full in the Indiana <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, March 20, 1827. Both Thom and Seth Leavenworth lost
                    popularity by advocating railroads. Hence, the first road was built from <placeName>

                    carried the letters while he was working around the town. If a man asked him
                    about mail, he took off his hat and ran the letters and gave the man whatever
                    were for him. Then he put the others in his hat and went about his business. The

                    Mr. Thorn once made a race for Congress but was defeated in the nomination. His

                        <region type="county">Crawford county</region>
                    </placeName> for many years till it was settled in 1918 when his grand-daughter,
                    Mrs. Hattie Henley, was appointed administratrix for the estate.</p>
            <p>After the county seat was located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1822 business began to boom. A man named Best bought a large
                    tract of timber which he sawed into plow beams. Mr. Best lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and owned a large hotel in that city. He put a heavy mortgage upon
                    the hotel to get the money to buy the saw mill which he set up at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. For a long time during the panic of 1837 and afterwards the market
                    was not very good, hence he could not sell the plow beams from which he hoped to
                    get the money to pay off the mortgage on the hotel. William Conrad, who ran a
                    store in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, one day called Best into the store and asked him about the matter.
                    Best was much discouraged and felt that he was sure to lose the hotel. Then Mr.
                    Conrad told Best that the men were intending to close the mortgage when it
                    became due but he was ready to help him and could loan him the money. On the day
                    on which the mortgage became due Conrad went with Best to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and paid off the mortgage. At that time he had acres of land
                    covered with sawed plow beams. After some time the sale of timber grew better
                    and the man paid Conrad every cent of the debt.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Mr. Best
                    brought with him a man named Frye to be his head sawyer. Mr. Frye who was a

                    and a pint of brandy with him. This request was performed and the ax and the

                    kept a large store in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in these early days. Saturday was the most trying day of all. On
                    that day the country people came to town to trade. West of the town about three
                    miles lived two large men named Wiseman. They weighed about three hundred pounds
                    each. There were two or three Goads in the county that were about as large and
                    as strong. A feud grew up between these parties. When they came to town on
                    Saturdays they did their trading and put all the groceries in their wagons and
                    then got brandy and went out under the trees to drink. A fight was sure to
                    follow in a few minutes. Then Mr. Conrad would go out and arrest the men and
                    bring them into the office, try and fine them 50 cents and costs. The men always
                    paid the fines, after which he would make them shake hands and agree to be
                    friends, give them a pint of brandy and put them into the wagon and send them
                    home rejoicing.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                    </placeName>. Having caught the western fever he came west in 1809 and located

                    and bought a large tract of land in 1818. While living at <placeName>

                    </placeName> where corn and wheat were ground and lumber sawed. In 1827 he built

                        <region type="county">Crawford county</region>

                    </placeName> in 1827. One of his objects was to move the county seat from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Leavenworth. Of course this always caused an uproar among the

                        <settlement type="city">Fredonia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He introduced several petitions sent to him by various citizens
                    and these caused so much confusion at times that Mr. Read of Davis and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin</region>
                    </placeName> counties refused to serve on the committee with him but led the
                    fight against the resolution. On a test vote the house refused to kill the
                    resolution. Later Mr. Leavenworth withdrew all the petitions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Leavenworth tried hard to get a law enacted to build a railroad from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. When the matter came up
                    before the people' of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford county</region>
                    </placeName> such a storm of opposition arose that he was not re-elected in
                    1828. He believed that railroads were better than canals and made a remarkable
                    speech in favor of railroads. This speech caused so much comment that the <hi rend="i">Indiana Journal</hi> secured a copy from Mr. Leavenworth and
                    printed it in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, March 20, 1827. Men said that the
                    "cars" would run over the stock in the fields and woods and
                    kill the children in the streets. At that time the stock ran out in the
                        forests.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One very far-sighted measure which Mr. Leavenworth advocated was a Marine
                    hospital for the sick river men. Often these men and women were exposed to the
                    cholera and other diseases while they were traveling on the boats. Sometimes
                    there would be an epidemic of cholera at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. A passenger returning from the south might develop the disease
                    while he was on the boat and expose everyone on the boat. After various
                    encounters in the house the measure was defeated. Had this law been enacted the
                    state would have been compelled to build a hospital at some town oh the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, where men who were sick on the boats might
                    be taken and cared for till they were able to go home.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    the great tide of immigration began in 1811 he moved west to the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he taught school one year. After he had closed his school in

                    the War of 1812 was practically over and a great number of men were moving west.

                    different from the broad horn, being pushed with oars and poles. This must have

                    spring of the best drinking water ran out from under the river hill. Hence the

                    </placeName>. A law was enacted in 1827 which provided for the relocating of

                    situation. Should the committee after a careful survey think that the seat of
                    justice ought to be moved, the committee was authorized to choose a new seat of
                    justice. This committee did not think it was best to move the seat of justice;

            <p>In 1831 the law of Indiana made a change in the way of doing county business.
                    Before that date most of the business was done by a board composed in <placeName>

                    </placeName> of justices of peace from each township. By the new law the county
                    was divided into three districts and one commissioner was to be elected from
                    each district. At the election held in August, 1831, Zebulum Leavenworth was
                    elected commissioner from the second district composed of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jennings</region>

                    </placeName> townships. James Glenn was elected from the third district composed
                    of Sterling and Patoka townships. The seal of the county commissioners consisted
                    of a round device containing these words: "Commissioners'

            <p>When I undertook to write the stories of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake county</region>
                    </placeName> pioneers, I had no thought of contributing anything to local
                    history, for it seemed obvious that the ground had been thoroughly searched for
                    information of historic interest. Mrs. Sheehan, Mr. Knotts, Mr. Bowers, Mr.
                    Matthews, and our friends in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Crown Point, and other places in the county, had given the public
                    accurate and intensely interesting reports of their findings.</p>
            <p>But I always have enjoyed visiting strange places and meeting interesting people.
                    I take in shorthand the exact words of those who have a story to tell. It is to
                    me a diversion which has become a hobby. When I record a story I hold myself
                    unaccountable for grammatical or other errors, for should any occur I can point
                    to the other person and say, "He told it." While the one who
                    tells the story can evade criticism by pointing to me and saying, "He
                    wrote it." My plan lessens the responsibility of both parties.</p>
            <p>Of the many stories I have recorded, the most interesting are of the early stage
                    routes, the trails, and the home life of the pioneers. One tells of hunting deer
                    and wild <placeName>

                    </placeName> on the banks of the Calumet; another of the taverns along the stage
                    roads; and still others, of seeing the first steam engine; of fighting bald
                    eagles along the beach; of visiting Indian encampments and partaking of muskrat
                    stew; of witnessing the exodus of the Pottawatamies when they were forced by the
                    government to leave the richest hunting grounds in America; of the battles
                    between gamewardens and poachers among the swamps of the Little Calumet; of the
                    first building on the present site of this city; and finally of the beginnings
                    of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hegewisch</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Among those whose stories I have recorded are: Mrs. Henrietta
                    Gibson, Rev. Handley, Isaac Crissman, Wm. Kunert, Mrs. Vincent, Mr. Pesche,
                    Conrad Fabian, Mr. Nimitz, Mrs. Carr, and Arthur Patterson.</p>
            <p>Copies of these stories are to be preserved in the city library by our secretary,
                    Mr. Baily, and they will be accessible to members of the historical society and
                    others who might be interested.</p>
            <p rend="center">REMINISCENCES OP MRS. HENRIETTA GIBSON (January 2, 1922)</p>
            <p>My full name is Henrietta E. Gibson. I was born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>, <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
               </placeName>, September 18, 1844. My father's name was
                    David Combs. He was born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>, <settlement type="city">New
                    York</settlement>
               </placeName>, and was a manufacturer of cloth. I have one
                    brother, Major George W. <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-018-2-043"/> Combs, of Glencoe, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Our family came by way of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1846, and to Ainsworth station, now called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on February 27, 1850. There was only one building there. That was
                    the depot, and a man by the name of Spears was agent. Father traded two horses
                    and a wagon and harness for forty acres where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hegewisch</settlement>
                    </placeName> is. That part of the country was called The Calumet region. It was
                    nothing but a wilderness of swamps, and the government sold the land for a
                    dollar and a quarter an acre. Our farm was right where the U. S. Rolling Stock
                    company factory is located, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hegewisch</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Father bought the James "H. Cassidy inn at the toll
                    bridge, in 1850, and bought the stage house from Mr. Brum-ley in 1853. That was
                    about a half-mile from the fork of the <geogName>Calumet river</geogName>. The
                    driver of the stage coach always blew a horn before he came in. Stages ran on a
                    regular schedule like the railroads, so we knew when they would come and watched
                    for them. Father would have horses hitched at the barn, or relay station, so
                    they could go right on to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The station was on the north side of the river at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hegewisch</settlement>
                    </placeName>. George Bunt kept the toll gate there and charged three cents for
                    each team that was driven across the river.</p>
            <p>There were lots of Indians there. They kept their wigwams right at the forks of
                    the Grand Calumet, about a half-mile south of our stage house. They were
                    Pottawatamies. Chief Shaubenee often came there on business. He was very
                    friendly. My mother often hired the squaws to work about the house, but they
                    wouldn't take any money for it because their husbands would take it
                    from them, so my mother gave them flour and eggs. One name was Naominequay (Na-o
                    mi-ne-quay'). She could talk English, and was rather nice looking. I
                    played with the Indian children a great deal and acquired a kind of a dialect so
                    I could talk with them. Two of the girls had English names, Mary and Elizabeth.
                    The boys hunted with bows and arrows; the older men, with old-fashioned guns.
                    Shaubenee was short and thick-set and had long hair. In cold weather he wore a
                    blanket and fairly good Indian clothes, including the leggings, blanket and
                    moccasins, and he always wore hoop earrings. His blanket was red, trimmed with a
                    black border–most of them wore gray. He used to say, "I be
                    Shaubenee–I own Shaubenee Grove." That <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-018-2-044"/> was the way he introduced himself. Once he brought
                    two girls to our house. I think they were his daughters. They went to Notre Dame
                    college and were fine girls. They dressed like Americans and played lovely on
                    the piano. He was proud of them and wasn't satisfied to have them like
                    the other Indian girls. When they came home they always came by stage. The
                    Indians always went to the Straits of Mackinac in summer. They were lazy, and
                    did nothing but hunt and fish. They were all Catholics, and we could hear them
                    worshiping in the morning. They would kneel down to the sun and chant. I often
                    went with my father to their wigwams. The squaws made baskets, moccasins and
                    miniature canoes of birch bark. They ornamented the things with porcupine
                    quills. They made flowers on the edges of the canoes and stained them with
                    berries. Most of them left in 1862, as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> was building up then and the whites were coming in fast and
                    crowding them out. Father sold the stage house there to Doctor Egan, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>I was married in 1860 and I only saw a few Indians after that. My husband was the
                    first station agent at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>. While we were there two boys called one day on their way home from
                    college. They were tall, straight and nice looking. They asked if I remembered
                    them, but I didn't; then one reminded me of something that had happened
                    at their camp when I had visited it, and then I remembered them. His name was
                    Antone. They were both well dressed. After we moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> I saw an encampment in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> is now. It was on the edge of the Calumet marsh right down here at
                    Twenty-first avenue, south of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Central and just north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> railroad, about a half a mile east of where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> is. I saw some of the Indians we knew at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hegewisch</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and often saw Shaubenee out here. One day when I was there they
                    had quartered muskrat and yellow hard corn they were cooking in a big camp
                    kettle that looked like a soap kettle. It set out in the open, and they had
                    sticks set up, with one across them to hang the kettle on. They dipped the stuff
                    out and ate it with some kind of wooden spoons or gourds. They were pleased to
                    have us come to see them, and they offered me some of the soup. I
                    didn't want to? taste it, but tried it to please them. I
                    didn't like it, for <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-018-2-045"/> they
                    didn't use any salt or other seasoning. The encampment was in a valley
                    at the base of a large dune they called Coup-ne-con'. Con Sheffier
                    removed the dune and he found the remains of an Indian in the sand. He gave them
                    to the Tolles-ton school and I suppose they are there yet. We knew the Joe
                    Bailly family well. I used to play with Rose and Frank. I visited them and they
                    visited me at Grandma Gibson's. They were half or part Indian and were
                    beautiful girls and well educated. But their grandmother was real Indian. She
                    lived in a hut by herself, and wore a broadcloth skirt, leggings and a shawl.
                    She was swarthy and had straight, black hair, but was rather nice looking. Most
                    of the Indians had clear-cut features. A half breed French and Indian lived near
                    them with the Indians. His name was Jean Baptiste Clooehie– we called
                    him "Clookie." A man in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> by the name of C. D. Wicker married one of the Bailly girls and
                    took a fancy to the half-breed. He arranged to have him stay with my
                    mother-in-law at the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> Inn, a mile or two east of Tolles-ton, where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> is. He lived there for twenty odd years and died when he was about
                    ninety years old. He was buried in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>

                    him. The Indians were nice to you if you were nice to them, but it

                    </placeName> station, near there, was named after my father-in-law's
                    brother. He had a farm between <placeName>

            <p>George Tolle, a man who manufactured surgical instruments, invested a good deal
                    in land around here, and built a house near where Lewis A. Bryan's
                    place is. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> was named after him.</p>
            <p>My mother-in-law, Anna Maria Gibson, kept a stage house where the Froebel school
                    building stands. It was called the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> Inn. She first went there in 1837, and her husband, Thomas Gibson,
                    built the inn in 1837 or 'S8. He came from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, in 1835. The hotel was a good, two-story, hewn
                    low building, which he built on the forty-acres. It faced east on the old wagon
                    road about where Madison street is, ns near as I can remember. It was a little
                    north-east of where the school building stands. I couldn't say how many
                        <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-018-2-046"/> feet from it, but it was right close
                    by. The barns stood about where the building is. The inn was close to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> Run, a small creek, and there was another small stream near there.
                    There were no other buildings nearer than'at Miller's (Miller
                    station) and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They sold out during the stock yards' boom. The tavern
                    was still standing in 1861 but was torn down shortly after.</p>

                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName>'s inn–we called mother-in-law,
                    "Mother." They generally got their dinner there, then came to
                    our place at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hegewisch</settlement>
                    </placeName> for supper, then went to the Five-Mile house, near Douglas
                    monument; that was called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> then. The stage crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Central about where Madison street is in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then ran to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They kept four and sometimes six horses on the stage.</p>
            <p>When I picked huckleberries around here there were no houses, except the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> inn. We lived in a two-story house where the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> station stands. My husband got fifty dollars a month, wood for
                    heating, light and rent, as station agent for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Central railroads. Lewis Kanothe came out in 1858 or '59
                    and started a little grocery at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>; then Charles Kunert and George Wendt came. Mr. Kunert bought and
                    sold huckleberries and made a lot of money on them. I have caught pickerel and
                    black bass right where the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> hotel stands. There was a slough, or swamp, there that was fed by a
                    stream from Long lake, near Miller. It didn't cost much to live them;
                    we had fresh milk, butter and cream, cranberries, honey from wild bees, mallards
                    and other game.</p>
            <p>In the early part of 1865 I had company at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> and had cooked potatoes for dinner. I put the parings in a pail and
                    set them on a bench back of the house. Pretty soon we heard some bumping and
                    knocking against the side of the house and I went out to see what the matter
                    was. A deer had been attracted to the salt in the potatoes and put his head in
                    the bucket to get at them. His horns had got fast against the bale and he
                    couldn't get out. He shook his head, then started to run with the pail
                    still sticking. He jumped the <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-018-2-047"/> high board
                    fence and the pail came off. He ran for the woods, but my husband started after
                    him with a gun and soon brought the deer back. As late as in 1865 he took a
                    vacation from the railroad and hunted deer from September to April. He shot
                    eighteen, and they were all killed around here and where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> stands. He showed me where he killed one right where the
                        <geogName>Lake Shore</geogName> station was built. He killed his last in
                    1880 on this side of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It happened to be on Thanksgiving day, and it seemed that every
                    one wanted to see the deer. He sold it to Mr. Brinkman, a market man, and he
                    gave it to the state. The head is mounted at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and there is a plate under it which tells when and where it was
                    killed.</p>
            <p>I don't think there is a foot of ground around here that I
                    haven't tramped over to pick huckleberries, and little did I think then
                    that such a fine city as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> would ever be built on those hills and swamps.</p>

            <p>I was born at <geogName>Deep river</geogName> and have lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake county</region>
                    </placeName> all my life–eighty-two years. My father, John Wood, was
                    born in 1800 and died at <geogName>Deep river</geogName> in 1883. He came from
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, in 1835, to
                    Wood's mills, three miles west of Ainsworth, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake county</region>
                    </placeName>. He had a saw mill and a grist mill; that is why they called the
                    place Wood's mills. He built a log cabin in 1835 and went back to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and brought the family out. The family came by way of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and from there to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                    </placeName> by stage. Friends brought them to <geogName>Deep river</geogName>,
                    a distance of twenty-five miles, and it took them two days. Daniel and Nathan

                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>

                    </placeName> was then the city of the west, and they expected it to be the
                    greatest. They also expected Liverpool to be a great city, and my grandfather,
                    Pattee, and my father bought lots there for $250 each. They
                    didn't think much of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> then. On the way from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to <geogName>Deep river</geogName> we stayed over night with a

            <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-018-2-048"/>
            <p>The roads were bad and we had to cross a bridge about a mile long, south of
                    Baillytown. Father and mother knew the Joseph Bailly family well and often
                    stopped there. There was another family by the name of Dillingham that they
                    knew.</p>
            <p>There was only Indians around <geogName>Deep river</geogName>, and we had no near

                    </placeName>, and but one man lived there. He was a sorl; of hermit. Solon
                    Robinson was at Crown Point. There was a tavern four miles west of us, south of
                    Lake station (now known as <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> is now. It was along the stage line.</p>
            <p>They used to run a stage from LaPorte to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Our place was on what is now known as the Lincoln

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    for I was ten years old at the time. There was a small hotel there then, and I
                    believe it is still standing.</p>
            <p>There was a tribe of Indians at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and they often came out to <geogName>Deep river</geogName> to hunt
                    and trap. In about 1841 or '42 about five hundred came through
                        <geogName>Deep river</geogName>. They were Pottawatamies. They were moved
                    out west and they stopped near us for two days to rest and to let the squaws do
                    their washing. There were several guards with them. One of the officers stayed
                    with us while they camped there.</p>

                    </placeName> and different states. Many of the travelers stopped and camped near

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>He used to walk to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and exchange blueberries for groceries. He was married to Augusta
                    Aurich and there were ten children: Emily was the oldest, then Ernest, William
                    C, Carolyn, Mary, George, Henrietta, Louise, Clara, Arthur, Walter and Charles.
                    There are nine living. I was born the third of January, 1864, here at the corner
                    of Taft and Ninth avenue.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> tavern was at Fourteenth and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Crone had a tavern a mile east of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> station; the next was Hoh-man's, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the next Reese's, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hegewisch</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at what they called the Indian ridge. They said there was quite an
                    Indian reservation on the ridge years ago. There were swamps and forests all the
                    way from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hegewisch</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> tavern was just about on the southeast corner of what is now
                    Madison street and Fourteenth avenue. I remember real well of the old tavern. It
                    was a plain building, and, if I remember correctly, the bottom was made of logs
                    and the top was frame. It faced east, to the best of my recollection. It stood
                    about three hundred feet west of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> run, and was torn down in about 1869 or '70. The run was
                    just about where <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName> street is. It got its water from the sloughs and run northwest and
                    emptied into the Calumet. The other branch they called <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> run came through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> between Garfield and Grant street, and it run from Eleventh avenue
                    to Roosevelt and Seventeenth.</p>
            <p>From 1876 to 1884 I did most of my hunting in what is now the first and second
                    subdivision of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or, rather, east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In them days I used to hunt for market, and my main stands were
                    just east of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> hotel, about where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> is, where the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> hotel stands, and about where the Emerson school is. The ponds,
                    there is where I did most of my hunting. It was all hunting with muzzle-loaders.
                    When I got thirty ducks a day father came after me with a wagon and got me. I
                    used to sell the mallards in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> for ninety cents to a dollar and fifteen cents a dozen. I <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-018-2-050"/> averaged easily thirty-six a day; I know
                    days that I got seventy. The upper end of the slough where the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName> hotel is was the best place for hunting. There was about eight to
                    ten feet of water, and on both sides of the slough there was a bed of rice about
                    thirty feet wide, and the rest was smart weed–that was great feed for
                    the ducks. At the other places there was rice and smart weed, and a good many
                    oak trees, and the ducks fed on the acorns. I killed forty-eight in one day in
                    1906 at about Sixth and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> streets. I went out in the forenoon and killed the limit and then I
                    went out again in the afternoon. I have seen deer here. They used to tell about
                    a big oak tree at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName>'s place at Ninth and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> where they could see three or four deer hanging most any day. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson</region>
                    </placeName> shot lots of them around here.</p>
            <p>I was out in 1870 with Mr. August Elser. He killed one north of Aetna on the
                        <geogName>Grand Calumet river</geogName> and another about where the Coke
                    plant is, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I have the heads of both of these mounted. There was John Becker,
                    August Keck, Ernest Harms and Herman Kirchoff in the hunting party. There was
                    one more killed after this in the pineries near Pine station, by John
                    Becker–that was in 1872 or '73. There were plenty of quail
                    and partridges.</p>
            <p>I was superintendent of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> club of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1889 to 1897. There was a hunting club along the
                        <geogName>Little Calumet river</geogName> that started with the following
                    members: August Elser, John Becker, George Stolley, James Ewen and Dan Owsley.
                    The men who came from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> came out to these men's places to hunt, and in 1868, I
                    think it was, they started the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> club of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The first superintendent was Daniel Hall, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then Alexander McDougal, Edward Savage, James French, Willard
                    West, myself, Frank Sommers, Ed. Brennan and George Haecker.</p>
            <p>The grounds were practically owned by the club. In the first place they bought
                    forty acres, then they got in a man by the name of Alexander, who owned the
                    ground surrounding the tract. They had his consent to dig the canal. After his
                    death they got possession of his farm of 320 acres. Their holdings extended from
                    what is now Chase street west to Clark, north to Twenty-fifth and south to the
                    meander line. There was a meander line on the north side and one on the <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-018-2-051"/> south side of the river. The government
                    laid that out as swamp lands, and it couldn't be sold for any other
                    purpose. Some people's land extended beyond the meander line; and the
                    club bought that from the owners and some they took by squatters rights. Quite a
                    little of this land went into litigation, for instance sections nineteen and
                    twenty, with John Cluff, father of John Burns, which suit they lost to Cluff;
                    section twenty-one, with John Gunzenhouser, which was won by the club. Several
                    other adjoining property owners had suits with the club, but the club won on all
                    of them.</p>
            <p>I took charge of the club on the first day of January, ana at about that time
                    there were several big battles between poachers and watchmen. In 1893 James
                    Conroy, head gamekeeper, and John Cleary were killed by Al Looker at John
                    Hargen's saloon. In 1894 Dick Stone, one of the guards, was killed on
                    the marsh. In 1896, when John Cluff won the suit, a battle raged between the
                    farmer boys south of the river in which Theodore Prott had his knee cap shot off
                    and Frank Kostic, a farmer boy, was shot through the lungs. Lawrence Traeger, a
                    watchman for Frank Whitlock, was shot, but Dr. Senn, Dr. Miller and Dr. Reynolds
                    happened to be out from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and they attended to him right there in the swamps, and he got all
                    right. Barney Whitlock and Charles Blackburn, guards, were sent to prison.
                    Barney got six months and a five-hundred-dollar fine, and Charley went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> for two to fourteen years, but was out in fourteen or fifteen
                    months.</p>
            <p>Frank Whitlock was head gamekeeper of the marsh and I was superintendent of the
                    house–they always had two superintendents. There was lots of small
                    skirmishes that were never recorded. I know of a number of instances. The Nimitz
                    brothers, John and Henry, were the most persistent of all the poachers.</p>
            <p>In 1894 was one of the greatest years for duck hunting that there was on the
                    marsh, according to the reports from all the members who had been going there
                    since 1896. In the 70's there was a good many canvasback and redhead;
                    and in the 80's and 90's there was more mallard, pintail and
                    bluing teal; there were also bluebill, spoonbill, gadwall, widgeon, green
                    wigdeon and green-wing teal. I knew of one swan and <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-018-2-052"/> one pelican killed in 1885 or '86. They
                    were killed by the club members.</p>
            <p>On the 27th day of October, 1894, F. A. Howe, president of the club, killed 143
                    ducks, mostly mallards; J. M. Glispie killed 117, R. M. Fair, a partner of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marshall</region>
                    </placeName>' Fields, killed 75 green head mallards in the morning and
                    took the 11 o'clock train back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> with his ducks. I went out all day and killed 198 ducks and two
                    geese.</p>
            <p>Some might think this a fish story but the facts are right on record at the club
                    house. I resigned from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> club in January, 1908, and went into business in the general store
                    here in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tolleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I sold out in the fall of 1899 ana went to work as game warden, in
                    1901. I was put in as traveling deputy commissioner on fish and game for the
                    state by Z. T. Sweeney, state commissioner. I resigned in February, 1905, to
                    fill the unexpired term of August Conrod, as township trustee of Calumet
                    township. The term expired January 1, 1908. Then I went into the real estate
                    business and stayed in that three years. I am now employed with the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>, we have a knowledge of the inner workings of the
                    Order in Indiana as it existed in the fall and winter of 1854.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> A description of its machinery at this time, when it was in the height
                    of its career, will not fit it at any other period, for it was continually in
                    evolution. The ritual was adopted at the meeting of the Grand Council at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> in June, 1854, and revised at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> meeting in November.</p>
            <p>The order was organized on the lodge system in a hierarchy of subordinate,
                    county, state and national councils. Subordinate councils could be established
                    only with the sanction, of the state council. An authorized agent of the latter
                    could confer the first and second degrees upon the applicants for a charter, who
                    must be at least nine in number, and organize them into a council. For the
                    charter the subordinate council paid the sum of two dollars to the state
                    secretary and five dollars for the entire work of the order. Each council was
                    designated by a name and a number. To become a member of the supreme order of
                    the Star Spangled Banner a person must be twenty-one years of age, a believer in
                    the Supreme Being, a protestant, born of protestant parents within the limits of
                    the jurisdiction of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, reared under protestant influence and not united in marriage with
                    a Catholic wife. Candidates were admitted by ballot; five black balls excluding
                    an applicant from the first degree and three from the second. Each council
                    elected its own officers, which consisted of a president, vice-president,
                    instructor, secretary, treasurer, marshal, chaplain, inside and outside
                    sentinels and sometimes <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The membership was organized in degrees. All persons elected to membership were

                    control the voter, who pledged himself to comply with the will of the majority
                    even though it conflicted with his personal preference, and not to vote for any
                    man for office who was not of native, protes-tant birth. Above the first degree
                    was the second, to which a member must belong to be eligible to office in the
                    order, or to command its support for office in the community. The applicant
                    pledged himself that, if elected to any public office, he would remove all
                    foreigners or aliens from office and in no case would appoint such to any
                    position of trust. The third degree, introduced at the <placeName>

                    The president supervised the work of expansion. He appointed one proxy for each
                    district in the state, which corresponded territorially to the eleven
                    congressional districts, and through these proxies, directed the policy of the
                    order. These proxies kept the president in touch with all sections of the state.
                    The other officers of the state council and the presidents of the county
                    councils also had the powers of proxies. The meetings of the state council were

                    </placeName>. This was a representative body composed of thirteen delegates from
                    each state, chosen by the state councils, with five delegates from each

                    </placeName>, each state cast the same number of votes as it had in both houses
                    of congress. Thirty-two delegates, representing thirteen states, constituted a
                    quorum. The grand council had power to fix the signs, passwords and all matters
                    concerning the secret ritual and decided what should be the national policy of
                    the order. The officers, a president, vice-president, corresponding secretary,
                    recording secretary and two sentinels, were elected annually by ballot. All
                    officers and delegates were required to be full degree members of the
                    organization. The sessions of the grand council were held annually. The officers
                    were salaried and the delegates received three dollars per day for their
                    attendance and mileage. Each state, district or territorial council paid the sum
                    of four cents per annum for each member into the national treasury of the

                    formalities for entering or leaving a meeting, and an elaborate initiation
                    ceremonial. All meetings were opened with prayer. At ordinary sessions the
                    members sat together as a first degree council. Separate sessions of the second
                    degree members might be held after the adjournment of the first degree council.
                    Probably there was also a third degree council session.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> So
                    far it differed little from other secret orders, but the peculiar characteristic
                    of the Know Nothing system was the fact that it sought to conceal the personnel
                    of its membership. It tried to keep absolutely all knowledge of the order hidden
                    from the outside world. To this end the time and place of the meeting's
                    were kept secret. The notice for a meeting was given by scattering right angled
                    triangular pieces of paper about the streets. An inquirer would ask a brother,
                    "Hate you seen Sam today?" It was from this password that the
                    order received the nickname of "Sam." A piece of paper of the
                    same shape, but red in color, signified suspected danger, and the brethern would
                    assemble prepared to meet it.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The name of the society was
                    disclosed to second degree members only. First degree members could truthfully
                    claim to "Know Nothing" of the organization. Secrecy on every
                    point was imposed on them. To avoid the questioning of curious outsiders, they
                    professed ignorance of all matters pertaining to the society, for which they
                    were dubbed "Know Nothings," in popular speech, and under that
                    name they have been known ever since.</p>
            <p>The political work of the order was divided between the subordinate and the
                    higher councils. The subordinate councils were designed to control the smallest
                    political areas. Each subordinate council in every corporate city, town or
                    township elected one delegate, with an additional delegate for every additional
                    fifty members of the council. These delegates met and nominated candidates for
                    city, town and township offices. The councils had free expression so far as the
                    instruction of delegates was concerned, but once the latter decided the policy

            <p>Likewise the county council nominated candidates for county offices. The

                    for state offices, and of state electors to be supported by members of the
                    order. Candidates for congress were nominated by district councils. The

            <p>Such was the organization of the order in the period of its greatest vigor. The

                    strong executive, so as to carry out the policy as decided by a few. How nicely
                    it worked in 1854 has been shown. But such a system was bound to fail. The fear
                    of the discipline of the order was in itself not sufficient to suppress
                    individualism, and in the struggle the system had to bend and then break up

            <p>The Know Nothing movement in Indiana had reached its crest in the fall of 1854.
                    As the slavery question gradually took precedence in the political world, Know
                    Nothingism waned in importance. In vain they fought to keep nativism foremost.
                    The discussion of the slavery question was forbidden. The Americans of the north
                    were to stand by their brethern of the south as co-workers in a common cause.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The anti-slavery agitation had already divided the Baptist
                    and Methodist churches into two parts–a forcible illustration of the
                    deep-seated hostility which already existed between the sections. It was
                    depriving the people of all their national sentiment and replacing it with the
                    fanaticism and bigotry of sectionalism.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The third or
                    "Union" degree embodied this nationalist doctrine and we have

                    the order with the hope of controlling its action. It was thought they were
                    planning to ally the south with the native labor of the north against the
                    immigrants who were anti-slavery in the main.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>From its origin the order in Indiana had been opposed to the further extension of
                    slavery. They vigorously refuted the charge that Know Nothingism paralyzed
                    anti-slavery sentiment. They pointed to the results of the state elections in
                    the north to disprove the assertion. Against this strong sentiment the ignoring

                    that the great principles of Americanism should take precedence over the mere

                            the following passage occurs: "You did not seek or solicit an

                            country and perpetuity to the Union. That as experience has shown it as

                            Executive of our country to be of native birth, we deem it equally
                            necessary and important that our diplomatic representatives abroad

            <p>Yet the great majority of the American party neartily approved the proceedings of
                    the state council. The opposition was confined entirely to the southern and
                    southwestern portions of the state. The majority regarded the liberalizing of
                    the order as a great advance, as an end of useless proscription, and the
                    position taken on the repeal of the <placeName>

            <p>In fact the state council of 1855 marks the end of the original character of Know
                    Nothingism in the state. The slavery question which threatened the order from
                    the beginning had gradually broken down the nationalism of the movement. The day
                    of mystery and secrecy was past and with it departed much of the dread and fear
                    which it inspired. Thereafter the American party was regarded as but little
                    different in character from the other parties. It was looked upon as
                    conservative rather than proscriptive. The connection between the anti-slavery
                    wing and the Republicans became continually closer, while the national or
                    straight Americans received less and less consideration from the other factions
                    of the opposition.</p>

            <p>The question of the platform absorbed much of the interest of the convention.
                    John W. Dawson, of the Indiana delegation, offered a resolution proposing to
                    expunge the twelfth section of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> platfrom, and substitute in its stead a declaration that slavery is
                    not a national but a sectional issue, and must be settled as such by the
                        states.<hi rend="sup">120</hi> It was referred' to the committee on
                    resolutions.</p>
            <p>J. C. Moody offered a resolution to repeal all rituals, tests of membership,
                    etc., leaving all regulations to the organization in each. It was laid on the
                        table.<hi rend="sup">121</hi>

            <p>The committee on resolutions, of which Sheets was a member, offered two
                    platforms, a majority and a minority report. The latter was not extreme, either
                    of Americanism or anti-slavery. It proposed to exclude slavery from the national
                    territories. The majority platform proposed to go into convention with the south
                    next February and in place of the existing twelfth section, to gain the
                    substitution of a plank calling for the restoration of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Compromise; if that failed congress should refuse to admit into the
                    union any state tolerating slavery, which should be formed out of any portion of
                    the territory from which that institution was excluded by the compromise. The
                    platform further provided that: the several state councils could admit to
                    membership all citizens who were eligible to office under section eight of the
                    national platform; protested against coalescence with any party which demanded
                    the postponement or abandonment of American principles; and requested the
                    president of the national council to call a meeting of the same at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on the 19th of the next February.<hi rend="sup">122</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This platform was adopted by a vote of ninety-six to eleven, each state
                    delegation having a vote equal to its electoral vote. All the Indiana
                    representatives voted for it. This shows the reactionary character of the
                    convention. The seceding body was making overtures and proposing a
                    reconciliation to those who had given them offense. To go into convention <list type="footnotes">

                    far as any hope of compromise favorable to the north was concerned. The effort
                    of the free state delegates to get back into the national council, no matter
                    what their motive was, would undoubtedly be construed as a confession of being
                    in the wrong and would confirm the south in refusing again. The Indiana men were
                    in sympathy with the majority. The absence of men with strong anti-slavery
                    principles, such as Colfax, Cumback and Orth and the other original seceders,
                    was noticeable.</p>
            <p>The Know Nothing organization seemed to be at the point of crumbling to pieces at
                    the end of the year 1855. Many of the councils were disbanding.<hi rend="sup">123</hi> Hundreds of their members withdrew and openly declared their

                    had rushed into the order to control it now as suddenly rushed out again. It now
                    seemed probable that the organization, which in 1854 was regarded as certain to
                    carry the state in the next presidential election, would not be able to make a
                    respectable contest in the election of 1856. The slavery question had played
                    havoc with "Sam's" plans.</p>

            <p>In the year 1787 my grandfather, McGowan with several others embarked on the

                    </placeName>); among the company were Jonathan and William Purcell and their
                    families. They proceeded down the river to the falls where <placeName>

                    </placeName> now stands, without accident or molestation. Landing there, a part
                    of the company with the women and children packed the horses with such things as
                    were needed for the journey, my mother, the child of one of the Purcells, being
                    eight years old. They followed an Indian trace [<placeName>

                    the mouth of the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>. At Au Post the men of the
                    overland party procured help with pirogues, the largest up-stream craft then in
                    use, and went down the <placeName>

            <p>They were among the first American citizens of that place. At this time my
                    father, John Patrick McGowan was eighteen years of age, he learned his trade of
                    gunsmith with Colonel [John] Small, at Au Post.</p>
            <p>After my father and mother were married they lived for some time in the village,
                    my father working for the Indian agent, Thomas Jones, at his trade of making
                    guns. While here an Indian named Pop in Dick, who was partly brought up by Mr.
                    Jones became very meddlesome about the shop. On one occasion he stepped on a
                    piece of hot iron, and severely burned his foot, which made him very angry at my
                    father, who was in no wise to blame. This same Indian afterward killed my
                    father.</p>

            <p>In the year 1808 or 1809 my father built and made improvements and established a
                    ferry on the east fork of <geogName>White river</geogName>, about one mile below
                    where <geogName>Mt. Pleasant</geogName> now stands [Hindostan]. Our nearest
                    neighbors were at Lick Creek, near where Paoli now stands in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange county</region>
                    </placeName>; there were a few families near <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>, <region type="county">Davis
                        county</region>
               </placeName>. Shortly after my father settled here, a man by
                    the name of Boggs built a cabin at or near where <geogName>Mt.
                    Pleasant</geogName> now' stands, a creek running into <geogName>White
                        river</geogName> still retains his name.</p>
            <p>About the year 1810 Levi Kinman, his wife and younger brother, Jeremiah, built a
                    cabin on the opposite side of the river from my father's. My father got
                    his help to roll his logs and raise his building from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, our breadstuff was brought up from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but our meat consisted of bear, deer and wild <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tu">turkey</region>
                    </placeName>. On this, with hominy and wild honey, we lived fat and fine. After
                    we were well established my father opened a house of entertainment for
                    travelers.</p>
            <p>I remember when the people called Shakers moved to the prairie which still bears
                    their name. I recollect when Captain [Spier] <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer</region>
                    </placeName>'s company, "the Yellow Jackets" stayed
                    at my father's house all night, in 1811, on their way to jdin General
                    Harrison's army. About this time the Indians became very hostile and
                    our neighbor, Boggs and family, were killed. Their house was afterward occupied
                    by a family named Dunham and later by people named Prior.</p>
            <p>During this time the Indians committed many depredations on the frontier and the
                    travelers. So, for their better security, the settlers built forts after this
                    manner. After felling the trees, logs were cut 12 to 15 feet long, the upper end
                    was sharpened, then a ditch was dug and these logs were set up close together in
                    it, the dirt was then packed tightly on each side, making a stockade surrounding
                    the largest house, on the best site which would be on an elevation, affording a
                    clear view for some considerable distance. To this house was added other houses
                    so as to accommodate the whole neighborhood. Into these forts the settlers took
                    their effects. Among the names I recollect are Forts Curry, Ochiltree, Pur-cell,
                    McClure and Decker in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox county</region>
                    </placeName>. When Fort Harrison was besieged, Purcell's fort
                    concentrated their forces <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-018-2-085"/> with
                    McClure's fort, both sites are in what is now <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> township.</p>
            <p>In one of these forts there was a pious man, who every evening called the
                    inhabitants to prayer. While engaged in prayer for their protection through the
                    night, the Indians drew near and while they listened, to the earnest pleadings
                    of these followers of the Most High, He that said "Touch not mine
                    annointed, and do my prophets no harm," put it into the hearts of those
                    Indians to turn aside from that place, they crossed the <geogName>Wabash
                    river</geogName> and attacked another fort in the dead hour of night. (This was
                    the testimony of an Indian after the war closed). While the Indians were
                    committing depredations two families that I remember, Bogard and Hathaway, were
                    attacked while moving at what is now called Steele's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, some of them were killed, others were saved by their teams running
                    away.</p>
            <p>In 1812' my father's house and Hawkin's on the west
                    fork of <geogName>White river</geogName>, were stations for a small company of
                    rangers. They passed from one station to the other every day so that each
                    station had guard only every other night, they not having a sufficient number to
                    divide. When they left our house one morning, they said that night would be the
                    last that we would be left without a guard. But, oh, fatal night. Our house was
                    attacked by the Indians, my father was killed in his bed, while my mother and an
                    infant sister were in the bed with him. The Indians then made an assault on the
                    house of our neighbor just across the river, but the two Kinmans with a youth by
                    the name of McGuire, held them off with their guns and dogs so that they soon
                    left. This was in May, 1812. The next day the rangers came, wrapped my
                    father's remains in a sheet, laid him on a puncheon taken from the
                    floor and buried him a few rods from the river bank. The Indian Pop-in-Dick, who
                    killed my father, was found to be a leader in assaults on the settlers, for in
                    his absence from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> there were always depredations committed. Before the war closed,
                    this Indian was killed by Tom White, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Harrison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In a few days after my father was killed, my uncles Purcell and
                    Balthis, came and moved us away from the ill-fated spot, to Purcell's
                    fort, which was seven miles northeast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where we lived until the assault on <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-018-2-086"/> Fort Harrison when, for our better security we
                    moved to McClure's fort. About this time two of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> boys, being away from their fort, were attacked by the Indians, one
                    was killed, the other supposed to have been captured.</p>
            <p>Through all these perilous times the people stood firm and true to each other and
                    our homely fare was free to all that saw fit to partake at our tables.</p>
            <p>While living at our home on <geogName>White river</geogName>, the Indians drove
                    off our cows, taking them into the vicinity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. If it had not been for a young man who worked for my uncle, named
                    Jacob Quick, who saw and knew the cows, it is likely we would never have seen
                    them again, but he got a company of neighbors together and they went after the
                    cows and recovered them for us.</p>
            <p>Our school-houses were built of logs and covered with boards, with poles to
                    weight them down, they were ceiled with poplar poles split, with the split side
                    turned down, the upper side was covered with mortar, to exclude the air. The
                    floors were made of puncheons split from trees, hewn till they were smooth. The
                    windows were made by cutting away half of two logs, nearly the length of the
                    house, putting them in the wall with the faces opposite, setting in split sticks
                    about four inches apart, and covering them with greased paper to prevent its
                    getting wet and to admit more light. The seats were made of split logs, the four
                    logs being inserted in holes bored in the ends.</p>
            <p>The writing desks were made of slabs or puncheons the same as the floor, and were
                    fastened to the wall under the window. Our books were few and hard to obtain.
                    Our tuition was paid by our parents, there being no school fund for us in those
                    days.</p>
            <p>The first plow that I used was called the bar-shear, with a wooden mould board,
                    and a bar two feet or more long.</p>
            <p>The next was the Carie or half-wooden mould board, which we thought was a great
                    improvement. I remember the first one was owned by Noah Purcell, and the farmers
                    went to see it, as one of the great wonders of the day.</p>
            <p>For grain and grass cutting we have advanced from the scythe and the sickle, to
                    the reaper and the mower. From treading out grain with horses and cleaning with
                    sheet and <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-018-2-087"/> wooden riddle, we have threshers
                    and separators of various models, and instead of broadcast sowing we plant our
                    seed with the drill.</p>
            <p>I recollect when <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> had but one brick house and that was General Harrison's.
                    The brick was made by Samuel Thompson, in payment for the land now owned by
                    Samuel Thompson, Jr., and Bradway Thompson. The second brick house was the
                    Seminary. The third was built by Charles Smith, this was later known as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> tavern.</p>
            <p>The first steam mill was built by Fellows &amp;Co. Samuel Thompson made the
                    brick for the furnace. I helped to haul them to the <geogName>Wabash
                    river</geogName> when we boated them to the building site.</p>
            <p>The first Presbyterian minister at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> was Samuel T. Scott. I recollect several of the first Methodist
                    circuit riders whose headquarters were at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, these were Schrader, Richards, Posey and James McCord. The first
                    Baptist minister was Isaac McCoy afterwards missionary to the Indians at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>How changed the scene in the last half century. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> has become a city, churches and schools have advanced. Keeping pace
                    with the general prosperity of our state. Many of those who in youth endured the
                    dangers and privations of the pioneer have passed away, but few of us are left.
                    Our heads are white with the frosts of many winters. Soon we, too, must pass
                    away, but while our outward man must perish, and return to mother dust, may our
                    inward life be renewed from day to day so that we may be ready when the summons
                    shall come.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> May 27,1874.</p>

                    </placeName>, Thursday, April 27. An all-day program had been arranged,
                    including the usual big dinner which always forms a valuable part of the
                    historical program. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> historical society is one of the few in the state that owns its own
                    home. Several years ago the society purchased the home of General Grose, and it
                    has been converted into a historical museum. Under the direction of Clarence H.
                    Smith, recently appointed curator, the historical society has grown greatly in
                    membership, and the museum collection is rapidly becoming one of the best in
                    Indiana. Over two hundred persons attended the annual spring meeting.</p>

                    </placeName> historical society held its first public meeting on Friday night,
                    April 28. One of the special features of the program was a large painting giving

                    the first white settlements, and contained a list of the first settlers in the
                    county. A valuable collection of pioneer relics furnished by Mr. and Mrs.
                    Charles Buckley was on display. Talks by Mrs. John W. Ballard of <placeName>

                    one dollars ($1.00). The old Lanier home, recently converted into an
                    historical museum, is visited by more than five hundred people yearly. Among

            <p>The passing of old Indiana newspapers, particularly those of a century's

                    Holliday's death, he had deposited in the State library as the property
                    of the state, his collection on the Civil war. This he had been gathering for
                    many years. It is one of the best in the middle West. The pamphlet collection is
                    of particular interest because these bear especially on the military prisons of
                    the Civil war period and are rare, and secondly, there are many items on the <placeName>

            <p>The Ft. Wayne historical society held its first quarterly meeting of the year
                    April 4. The program included a dinner, followed by an historical pageant. As
                    announced on the program the pageant was given to honor the Peltiers–<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first pioneer family, depicting scenes in their
                    subsequent life with faithfulness to historical facts as these are now
                    obtainable. The prologue, written by Mrs. A. J. Detzer, described the coming of
                    the Peltiers "merest lads were they both" in 1787; the arrival
                    in the summer of 1804 of the beautiful Angeline Chapeteau, and the welcome given
                    to her by the people living in and near the Old Fort. Mrs. Samuel Taylor <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-018-2-092"/> was the author of the pageant proper, which
                    was divided into five episodes and twelve scenes. The musical program was
                    arranged by Mrs. Will H. W. Peltier, pianist, and Mrs. Florence Cleary, soloist.
                    The pageant was directed by Ross Lockridge, Vice-President of the Society, and
                    the character interpretations were given by the Indiana University Extension
                    public speaking classes. The program emphasized three things: the importance of
                    family histories; the necessity for trained speakers; and the value of the
                    pageant in teaching history.</p>
            <p>On January 28, 1921, the Indiana Historical Commission received a letter from the
                    secretary of the Northern Indiana historical society, in which the information
                    was given that the society had been asleep for a few years, but signs of renewed
                    activity were evidenced in the electing of new officers, and the securing of an
                    appropriation to be expended in buying furniture and cases to furnish the rooms
                    of the society which had been permanently located in the old court house of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph county</region>
                    </placeName>. Through the efforts: of the new officers, Dr. H. T. Montgomery,
                    president, John A. Hibberd, secretary, and Frank A. Stover, treasurer, a bill
                    was presented to the General Assembly of 1919, which would make it possible for
                    historical societies having a collection of records, papers, and historical
                    relics, to obtain an appropriation from the county commissioners for the
                    employment of a curator to take charge of the rooms and collections of the
                    societies, and make them available to the public. Credit is due to the Northern
                    historical society for the passage of Senate Bill 190.</p>
            <p>On March 1, of this year, the county commissioners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph county</region>
                    </placeName> made the appropriation provided for in the bill, and upon the
                    recommendation of the society Mrs. Eva Hoffman was employed as curator. The
                    rooms of the society are now open three days in the week, and the work of
                    cataloging and classifying the collections of the Society is going forward
                    rapidly under the direction of Mrs. Hoffman. One annual meeting of the society
                    is held each year, with special meetings at the call of the president. The
                    annual meeting of this year was held on the evening of April 7. One of the
                    interesting features of the program was a talk by George Brennan, of <pb n="217" id="VAA4025-018-2-093"/>

                    the publisher. A representative of the Indiana historical commission was present
                    and gave an informal talk on the work of the commission in co-operation with
                    local historical societies. Talks were made by Dr. H. T. Montgomery and local
                    members of the society. A committee was appointed to take up the work of
                    compiling a history of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph county</region>
                    </placeName>'s part in the World war, in manuscript form for
                    publication.</p>
            <p>The regular monthly meeting of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington County</region>
                    </placeName> historical society was held March 25. A memorial service was a part
                    of the program in honor of a former citizen and president of the Old Settlers
                    society, Lewis N. Smith. The biographical sketch was read by Mrs. Asa Elliott,
                    together with a letter from Dr. S. W. Smith of Leesville, a son of the deceased,
                    who gave to the society two Bibles over one hundred years old, formerly the
                    property of his father. A sketch of the life of Col. S. D. Sayles was read by
                    his daughter, Mrs. Martha L. Hobbs; and a paper on the Mounds of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Howard</region>
                    </placeName> Township by S. H. Mitchell. This paper was prepared in connection
                    with the archeological and historical survey which <placeName>
