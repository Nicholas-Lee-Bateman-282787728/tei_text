                    </placeName> history, and it had been no laughing matter.</p>
            <p>Writing over fifty years ago, economist Wilfrid Harris Crook defined a general strike as one by
                    "a majority of the workers in the more important industries of any one locality or
                        region."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> By this definition, he argued, there had been only one

                    </placeName>, the Seattle strike of 1919. In a 1960 study, however, Crook identified several other
                    instances of what he considered to be general strikes: <placeName>

                        (Hamden, Conn., 1960), ix. The major general strikes, Crook found, had occurred in other
                        countries, frequently with important results. For example, a 1931 general strike in <placeName>
                            <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                        </placeName> forced the resignation of that country's president; in 1926 a nationwide
                        walkout by a number of unions in Great Britain caused bitter divisions there and led to the
                        passage of significant antilabor legislation; some three hundred thousand Swedish workers
                        participated in a 1909 walkout which lasted for a month. These and many other general strikes
                        are discussed in Crook's <hi rend="i">General Strike</hi> and <hi rend="i">Communism

                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> episodes, but far fewer seem to be aware that these were not the only general strikes
                    that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has experienced. Certainly the shutdowns on the West Coast were the most conspicuous.
                    The Seattle strike drew national attention and helped feed the antiradical crusade of
                    1919–1920. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> strike also attracted a nationwide audience and was one of the most controversial labor
                    disputes of the New Deal years. Most of the other general strikes in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> have been minor affairs of limited import; still, the general unfamiliarity with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> general strike is surprising.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> While <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s "labor holiday" was neither as violent as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> dispute nor tinged with the radicalism of the Seattle strike, it nevertheless did
                    attract national attention. An effective twoday shutdown of an entire city by a broad coalition of
                    labor unions, the strike resulted in an extended period of military rule for the city and
                    surrounding area and ultimately gave rise to a civil liberties battle which was fought out in the
                    press and the courts. By any standard <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s labor holiday was a general strike of significant proportions and worthy of

                    and thus played an important part in the events leading to the general strike. In a very real sense
                    the roots of the general strike stretched back to World War I and beyond.</p>

                    the city's population grew by 20 percent; between 1900 and 1910 the number of residents
                    rose dramatically from 36,673 to 58,157; and by 1920 the city's population was above
                    66,000. This growth rested upon expanding industry and commerce; particularly crucial were the
                    city's choice location and a boom in the local coal industry. The decline of natural gas
                    supplies in the region and the consequent shift of many industries to the use of coal benefitted <placeName>

                    unfortunate conjuncture of technological and political developments, the industrial base of the city
                    was profoundly shaken in the early 1920s. The first blow came with the adoption of nationwide
                    prohibition, which destroyed the local brewing industry and did nearly the same to local distilling.
                    An estimated 3,500 jobs were directly eliminated with prohibition, and such related industries as
                    bottle manufacturing also were severely affected.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> At the same time the

                    industries also suffered. In 1923 the Pennsylvania Railroad, apparently concerned about its

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> labor, moved its repair shops from the city. Several hundred jobs were lost as a
                    result. Railroad traffic also dropped, and the local brick industry declined sharply. All of these
                    problems led to high unemployment and a loss of population in the 1920s, and by the middle of the
                    decade <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> had fallen to sixteenth place among the state's manufacturing cities.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These economic problems produced a strong undercurrent of antagonism and distrust between labor and
                    management and a sense of frustration with the city's shocking economic turnaround. Labor
                    was severely affected by the city's depressed economy; unions were hit particularly hard,
                    and by the early 1930s it was reported that the former union stronghold was only 20 percent
                        organized.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Tensions were exacerbated by the antiunion views of a number of
                    important businessmen, particularly those who dominated the city's Chamber of Commerce.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The result was increasing friction between labor and management and recurrent
                    labor disputes. Other community leaders, who might have acted as stabilizing influences and
                    encouraged cooperation in facing the city's problems, did not care to lend their services.
                    As Robert R. Drummond has noted, during the 1920s the city's oldest families, apprehensive
                    over labor unrest and economic hardship, "turned their attentions to preserving the family
                    fortunes. Their energies were consumed in maintaining their <hi rend="i">status quo</hi> rather than
                    in engaging in new ventures which might have benefited the city."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The search for scapegoats further heightened community divisions. The city's middle class
                    saw labor unions—particularly the United Mine Workers, which had engaged in bitter
                    strikes early in the 1920s—as the cause of the city's problems; labor blamed
                    antiunion employers and their vehicle, the Chamber of Commerce; and management blamed labor. These
                    deep divisions and the absence of effective local leadership precluded any far-reaching <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> began an aggressive organizing drive to recover the power that they had lost after
                    World War I. Under the protection of the act's Section 7 (a), workers in several industries
                    and businesses unionized, frequently after striking to push their demands for recognition. In 1934
                    there were strikes against local milk and lumber companies, paper mills, hothouses, hotels,
                    restaurants, breweries, factories, and the electric company. Issues in these strikes varied, with
                    wages, working conditions, and the distribution of work evenly among employees as frequent themes.
                    Above all union recognition repeatedly was singled out as the key issue, and it was an issue that
                    the unions usually won.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> By August, 1934, the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Unionists had little doubt as to the cause of this success. F#2 D. Roosevelt's NIRA was a

                    </placeName> labor, and labor was quick to show its appreciation. From the passage of the NIRA until

                    stressed the importance of the act to the American worker. Such headlines as "UNIONS SCORE

                    Blue Eagle" appeared frequently in the newspaper, and local labor organizations sponsored an annual

            <p>Union gains continued into early 1935, but local labor relations took on an increasingly hostile
                    tone. Most of the strikes in 1934 had been short and peaceful. In most cases employers had proven
                    conciliatory—perhaps because they felt relief at the prospect of economic recovery,
                    perhaps because they were uncertain how zealously the federal government would carry out the
                    provisions of the NIRA and how the courts would interpret the act, or perhaps because of their
                    longstanding concern with building a reputation for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a good town for industry to locate in.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> A number of strikes
                    early in 1935 followed the same pattern as the earlier disputes, with union recognition as the
                    principal demand and settlements reached fairly quickly.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the first half of 1935, however, both labor and management increasingly came to believe that a
                    showdown with the other side was approaching. A major strike at the local clothing plants of the
                    Stahl-Urban Company revealed the growing tensions in relations between labor and capital in <placeName>

                    employees and laid before them his objections to labor organizations, so the situation was tense
                    when the United Garment Workers of America (UGWA) began organizing the plants in the same month as
                    the NLRB decision. Elizabeth Hogan, a UGWA organizer, soon had a majority of the company's
                    workers on the union rolls. After unsuccessful negotiations concerning union recognition, about 75
                    percent of the company's six hundred employees walked out on March 13. They soon made it
                    clear that they intended to stay out until they secured a union shop contract.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

                    </placeName> soon stepped in to mediate the dispute. This time, however, neither side was interested
                    in compromise. The strike quickly grew bitter, with the union charging that the company had refused
                    to recognize it and had instituted a speedup on the production line and the company countering with
                    allegations that most employees had joined the United Garment Workers only under extreme
                        pressure.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Negotiations dragged on for five weeks, complicated by the
                    formation of a company union and suspicions that the plants were going to reopen with nonunion
                        labor.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> These developments helped solidify union support for the strikers.
                    The <hi rend="i">Advocate</hi> urged all workers to back the garment workers in "the
                    struggle for economic security against industry heads who are today challenging the right of the
                    workers to organize…."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> The United Mine Workers'
                    District 11 convention, meeting at the time, adopted a resolution of support for the strikers, as
                    did a number of UMW locals and the local typographical union.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> It was only
                    after a deadlock of several weeks that federal conciliator Robert Mythen worked out a settlement in

            <p>The Columbian Enameling and Stamping Company had moved to <placeName>

                    </placeName> around the turn of the century after operating under a different name in Ohio and <placeName>

                    in part attracted by the availability of coal, iron, and steel in the area, as well as by a city
                    promise not to annex the land on which the company located. The plant thus enjoyed city services
                    without being subject to local taxation. In subsequent years this was the source of some resentment
                    against the company, as was the staunchly antiunion outlook of its management. Columbian workers,
                    although employed in frequently hot, unpleasant, low-paying work, remained unorganized even during
                    local labor's heyday before World War I. Some believed company managers actively prevented
                    organization by using a spy system and discharging prounion workers, and few doubted that the firm
                    was one of the strongest open shop establishments in the city.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> These
                    circumstances created among local unionists an undercurrent of dislike for the company that was to

            <p>Even the Columbian Enameling and Stamping Company was not untouched by the organizing drive of the
                    early New Deal years. Wages, always low, had been cut three times after the onset of the depression.
                    The establishment of an NRA code for the industry, however, brought a substantial raise in pay. More
                    significantly, enameling plant employees were able with the help of AFL organizers and miners from
                    the surrounding area to establish a union, Federal Labor Union No. 19694. By September, 1934, about
                    90 percent of the Columbian workers had joined. Management initially had refused to meet with
                    representatives of the union, but under pressure of a three-day strike and with the efforts of the <placeName>

                    first union agreement was signed on July 14, 1934. It provided for grievance procedures, seniority,

                    and other terms. The contract <list type="footnotes">

            <p>To this point the Columbian dispute had followed the prevailing pattern of local labor relations:
                    quick organization of a union local with the help of outside organizers, a brief strike with union
                    recognition as the key issue, and a settlement which granted the union bargaining status. The only
                    difference was that in this case, unlike several other disputes at this time, the company had
                    refused to accede to the closed or union shop, and the union had not sought to press the point.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The brief strike in July, 1934, was only the beginning of an extended period of labor unrest at
                    Columbian. In August a union plan for establishing an automatic checkoff system whereby membership
                    dues would be deducted from employee paychecks was rejected by the company, which claimed that such
                    a system could not be instituted under Indiana law—a claim labor considered particularly
                    weak because Columbian already handled insurance premium deductions in a similar manner.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> At the same time workers were coming to believe that only a closed shop
                    agreement could insure the survival of the union. The company's establishment of what was
                    known formally as an "athletic club" reinforced their view, for members of the club (all
                    apparently nonunion employees) were believed to be receiving better jobs, treatment, and fringe
                    benefits than did other workers. To union members this seemed clear evidence that the company had
                    not shed its longstanding antiunion views and was working to undermine the organization.
                    Rank-and-file dissatisfaction and pressure for the closed shop grew, forcing union officials to
                    request a renegotiation <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">32</hi> In a closed shop union membership is a precondition of
                            employment—i.e., only union members can be hired; in a union shop employees are
                            required to join a union after having been hired (usually within a specified period of
                            time). During the organizing drives of the 1930s these terms sometimes were used
                            interchangeably, as the distinction between them does not seem to have been clearly drawn by
                            many people. Those involved in the Columbian strike referred to their demand for a union
                            shop on at least one occasion, and it is possible that such an arrangement as currently
                            defined is what they actually desired; for the most part, however, they used the term closed
                            shop in their demands, and this terminology has been retained here.</item>

                    represented by its negotiating committee and AFL organizer Thomas N. Taylor, requested a closed shop
                    and wage increase; company manager Werner Grabbe replied that economic conditions made a raise
                    impossible and that a closed shop violated the principles under which the company always had
                        operated.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The situation worsened in January, 1935. Early that month the union committee reiterated its demands
                    for a closed shop and wage increase, adding a request that the company lay off any member suspended
                    from the union. The company responded in a manner sure to make matters worse: it sent a circular
                    letter directly to all employees, completely bypassing the union. The letter merely repeated the
                    firm's earlier position; it was the form of the reply which was crucial. By going over the
                    union's head directly to the workers the company seemed to be moving toward a denial of the
                    union's authority to speak for employees. A subsequent union request for arbitration of the
                    dispute brought another circular letter, and by the time the negotiating committee and management
                    again met on March 5 tensions were running high.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The company's position at the talks removed any doubts among unionists that Columbian
                    intended to destroy the union. Again, all proposals were rejected by the company representatives; a
                    final request that the points of disagreement be arbitrated, as provided for in the 1934 contract,
                    also was rejected. Union leaders were uncertain about what action to take. Officials of the Central
                    Labor Union apparently counseled patience, but rank-and-file pressure, particularly for the closed
                    shop, was too strong for leaders to resist. On March 23 a strike was called. An estimated 450 union
                    members, about 90 percent of the organized workers and 75 percent of the company's work
                    force, walked out. Company president Charles B. Gorby's response was an announcement that
                    the plant would close March 30 for an indefinite period.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several attempts to settle the strike followed. Soon after it began, Department of Labor conciliator
                    Mythen, who was working on the Stahl-Urban strike, interceded in the Columbian dispute. After
                    meeting with both sides Mythen concluded that the union's demand for a closed shop was
                    reasonable. The company, however, <list type="footnotes">

                    picketing the plant and had established, with the help of other local labor organizations, a

                    </placeName> between 1933 and 1935 had fostered a strong sense of unity among local workers, a unity

                    all labor disputes in the city and the frequency with which union locals adopted resolutions of
                    support for and lent aid to striking organizations. The Columbian strikers from the beginning
                    received such encouragement. As early as March 27 the <hi rend="i">Advocate</hi> expressed support
                    for the workers at the enamelware plant.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The UMW's district
                    convention voted to lend "every measure of cooperation and help that we can possibly give"
                    to the strikers. Many local labor organizations contributed to the Columbian strikers'
                    commissary; in May, for instance, the <hi rend="i">Advocate</hi> noted that twenty-four UMW locals,
                    forty-three craft unions, and "a host of friends and sympathizers" had subscribed to the
                    commissary fund.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As spring passed, the dispute at the enameling plant drew increasing attention from local labor,
                    becoming something of a <hi rend="i">cause célèbre</hi>. This was, no doubt,
                    partly because the Columbian dispute was the only major strike in progress at the time. Other
                    considerations also led local unionists to see the Columbian strike as significant for all of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> labor. The enameling plant union was, as the <hi rend="i">Advocate</hi> noted,
                    "the strongest and largest of the newer unions in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>." The company's longstanding reputation as an antiunion employer and
                    the consequent hostility toward it also increased interest in the strike's outcome. Most
                    important was the growing belief among unionists that the Columbian management's actions
                    were the first steps in a major employer conspiracy designed to crush organized labor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

            <p>By May the situation was critical. The company still refused to enter into negotiations as long as
                    the closed shop was a union demand. Efforts at arbitration by the Department of Labor and the mayor
                    had proven futile, no community leaders seemed to have the influence needed to get both sides to
                    resume negotiations, and the strike was at an impasse. At the same time the Supreme Court was
                    preparing to decide the constitutionality of the NIRA; on May 27, in the Schechter decision, the
                    court found the act unconstitutional. For <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> labor this ruling was a serious blow. The NIRA had provided the impetus for the
                    organizing drive that had brought labor back as a major force in the city, and it was widely
                    believed that management would attempt to wipe out labor's gains as soon as the
                    act's legal umbrella was removed. Even members of the Chamber of Commerce recognized
                    labor's fears about the decision, and the group urged employers to comply voluntarily with
                    the former NRA codes to allay the prevalent "feeling of apprehension and unrest" and the
                    fear that employers might "adopt the policy of reducing wages or changing working
                    conditions to the detriment of labor."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On May 28 the Central Labor Union sponsored a parade and mass meeting in support of the Columbian
                    strikers. Over two thousand union members and sympathizers from the city and the surrounding area
                    heard Thomas N. Taylor, president of the Indiana Federation of Labor and AFL organizer, tell them:
                    "It's your union that's in jeopardy …. The working people of
                    this city cannot afford to lose this strike." Taylor traced the background of the strike,
                    charging that managers of the Columbian company had attempted to sow dissension among workers and
                    had violated the 1934 agreement with the union by refusing to accept arbitration. The Reverend James
                    Kelly, pastor of the Community Church, urged vigilance against any attempt by employers to take
                    advantage of the Supreme Court's NIRA decision. "If the employing class takes
                    advantage of the situation," he said, "… I believe all organized labor
                    must rise and say, ‘Gentlemen, it must not be done!’" Other speakers included
                    UMW District 11 vicepresident Charles Funcannon, who praised the solidarity of <placeName>

                    strikers; United Garment Workers organizer Elizabeth Hogan, who thanked <placeName>

                    Schafer. The assembly also voted to urge Congresswoman Virginia Jenckes to support the Wagner Bill,

            <p>The Columbian Enameling and Stamping Company's subsequent actions could hardly have been
                    more effective in fulfilling labor's worst fears. Many, in fact, believed that the company
                    set out to provoke trouble. Regardless of their intentions, company officials soon seemed to be
                    moving in precisely the direction labor expected: toward an assault on the enameling
                    workers' union and thus, indirectly, on all organized labor. On June 11 company officials
                    met again with union representatives. The company took its firmest stance yet, with manager Grabbe
                    informing the union negotiators that in the future the management would have no further dealings
                    with the union and that if the plant reopened it would do so only on a nonunion basis. Here, it
                    seemed to unionists, was the beginning of the expected employer offensive against organized labor.
                    Even Regional Labor Director Robert Cowdrill believed that the company was taking advantage of the
                    NIRA nullification by refusing to negotiate with the union or accept mediation.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Soon the company was sending representatives to talk to striking employees in their homes
                    to tell them, as the <hi rend="i">Advocate</hi> wryly noted, "how much the company loves
                    them when they don't belong to the union." The union responded by issuing an
                    appeal through the press for "a citizens' protest against the proposed operation
                    of the plant with strikebreakers." Local unions passed resolutions urging the governor,
                    mayor, and sheriff to "refuse to assist this company in their exploitation of workers,
                    their evasion of taxes and their uncompromising antagonism to Labor by furnishing, commissioning or
                    authorizing any police, deputy sheriffs, or other armed guards to assist them in re-opening the
                        plant…."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the wake of the Supreme Court's NIRA decision belated efforts were made by other
                    community leaders to defuse the situation. The Chamber of Commerce's appeal for continued
                    observation of NRA standards was one such effort; the Chamber also established a three-member
                    committee to act as a go-between and conciliator for local employers and employees. Thus far the
                    press had said little about the growing labor crisis, apparently, as <hi rend="i">The</hi>

                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> stressed that "the chief ingredient of prosperity is peace" and
                    seconded the Chamber's view that "any community which gives way to disorder and
                    unrest can hardly expect industry to seek out that community as a happy location." The

            </p>
            <p>It was, however, too late for such half-hearted efforts at conciliation. Company actions had firmly
                    convinced local labor that the Columbian plant soon would open with nonunion labor.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> This belief received apparent confirmation on Saturday, June 15, when several armed,
                    uniformed private guards were seen entering the plant, which to that point had been guarded only by
                    a small contingent of city police. Because there had been no violence connected with the
                    strike—one contemporary recalls that "the policemen and the pickets would play
                    cards all day long and fraternize and everything was peaceful"<hi rend="sup">48</hi>—the appearance of private guards seemed clear evidence that the company was
                    preparing to defend and reopen the plant. By noon a large crowd of strikers and sympathizers had
                    gathered at the plant as news of the guards spread, and some windows were broken by flying rocks.
                    Local police were able to maintain order, and the situation remained calm until early Sunday morning
                    when a large crowd moved against the plant, overrunning police lines and forcing entry. In the
                    ensuing riot the demonstrators left little doubt as to the focus of their anger: according to press
                    reports, "the executives' desks were overturned, telephones were smashed, the
                    telephone exchange was demolished, clocks were pulled from the walls and typewriters and office
                    machines were thrown to the floor." Only the offices were attacked; except for broken
                    windows the actual manufacturing areas were not harmed. The special guards proved a bad investment:
                    when the mob broke in, they departed for remote areas of the factory complex until order was
                    restored by police <list type="footnotes">

                    informal direction. It seems likely that some of the "outside sympathizers" were area
                    miners, who still were lending strong support to the Columbian strikers and who had long experience
                    with direct action in labor disputes. Others involved seem to have represented a cross section of <placeName>

                    appointed a citizens' committee to aid O'Connor in any way possible; members

            <p>These renewed efforts at mediation proved fruitless, and in the face of the continued deadlock
                    tensions grew. By the beginning of July the Chamber of Commerce's industrial expansion
                    committee—charged with attracting new industry to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>—was in a less than conciliatory mood. The committee called a meeting at the
                    Hotel Deming; the 125 local businessmen who attended heard speakers denounce the "outside
                    agitators" who "are not only preventing the gaining of new industries for the city, but are
                    putting the city in danger of losing some of the industries it now has." Speakers, who
                    included Chamber president Isaac Silverstein and other figures prominent in the organization,
                    decried the influence "paid organizers" and "radicals" from outside had come to
                    exert over <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> labor. These "false teachers and false prophets" had brought in a new and
                    dangerous philosophy of natural enmity between employers and employees. Recent troubles, the
                    speakers argued, meant that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "which a few months ago was recognized as one of the brightest spots in the
                    country, was not only having its standing greatly impaired because of strikes and labor troubles,
                    but that it was in danger of losing several existing industries …." The only
                    solution was for city and county authorities to beef up their law enforcement capabilities with more
                    officers and increased expenditures. Police Chief Lewis Wheeler and Sheriff William Baker both spoke
                    at the meeting, as did Deputy City Attorney William Littlefield. Wheeler pledged future cooperation
                    with the group, which was envisioned as an ongoing organization, and indicated that he would
                    investigate for possible local adoption an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> ordinance which forbade crowds to gather around plants where strikes were in
                        progress.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chamber meeting marked the end of any hopes that that organization might be able to serve as a
                    mediator in the strike. The next day the Columbian union charged Chamber officials with
                    misrepresentation and an "undemocratic, un-American attitude" and notified the
                    organization's negotiating committee that "further negotiations with your
                    committee on public relations is [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] not desirable."<hi rend="sup">54</hi> To the union it seemed that the Chamber had come down on the side of the Columbian
                    management in its drive to crush the union and that local law enforcement officials apparently were
                    willing to support the effort.</p>
            <p>The final blow to labor peace came two weeks later. On July 17 the Columbian Company brought some

                    </placeName>; the city's response was to provide a police escort into the plant for the men
                    and a carload of guns and ammunition that they brought with them. Once inside, the men were armed
                    with shotguns and submachine guns and placed on guard duty.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Such a force
                    obviously was too small to operate a plant the size of the Columbian; the guards, rather, were
                    brought in to provide protection for nonunion workers who subsequently would be hired to work there.</p>
            <p>Labor's response was immediate. On Friday, July 19, representatives of nearly fifty local
                    labor unions met to discuss the situation. Most of the unions concerned were affiliated with the
                    AFL, but the meeting had no formal connection with the county's Central Labor Union; no
                    minutes of the meeting exist, and subsequent discussions of it were vague. It is, therefore,
                    impossible to determine who first suggested a general strike as a possible course of action. The
                    subject was not a new one, however. A year earlier local unionists had discussed a possible general
                    strike in sympathy with a strike against the local packing plants;<hi rend="sup">56</hi> 1934 also

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and in June, 1935, a threatened general strike in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been narrowly averted.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Wherever the initial suggestion came
                    from, there was near unanimity on the need for a firm response to the importation of the guards.
                    Representatives of forty-eight unions voted a "labor holiday" to take effect unless
                    "strike breakers are deported … by or before 1 A. M. Monday, July 22,
                    1935." According to a resolution issued to the local papers, the strike was to continue
                    until the guards were removed; some accounts later indicated that the strike originally was to last
                    only twenty-four hours but continued longer because strike leaders were unable to convince union
                    members to return to work.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>

            <p>The American Federation of Labor long had opposed the general strike as a tactic in labor
                        disputes,<hi rend="sup">59</hi> so local AFL affiliates and their leaders were placing
                    themselves in a dangerous position by participating. Officially, the Central Labor Union had no ties
                    with the general strike movement. Most local labor leaders also tried to disassociate themselves and
                    their organizations from the tactic, portraying it as a wildcat strike begun directly by militant
                        rank-and-filers.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> To a certain extent this view no doubt was accurate.
                    Union members' support for the Columbian strikers clearly was strong, and response to the
                    general strike call was overwhelmingly favorable. Without rank-and-file pressure on union leaders
                    this one local strike probably would not have assumed the vital importance it came to have in local
                    labor circles.</p>
            <p>Yet the disavowals of support by union leaders do not quite ring true; it seems likely that some
                    local labor leaders, despite their public pronouncements, also played important roles in the strike.
                    AFL organizer Taylor, for instance, had, according to one report, suggested to officers of the CLU
                    that they call a general sympathy strike and later had gone to local union leaders with the idea,
                    convincing many of them of its value and thus paving the way for the July 19 meeting and strike
                    call. During the strike itself, Taylor acted as local representative of AFL president William Green
                    and was instrumental in getting the shutdown ended. At one point midway through the crisis, however,
                    he went so far as to urge strikers to hold firm in their demand for removal of the Columbian
                        strikebreakers.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> Labor leaders also seem to have helped coordinate the
                    strike. Because the shutdown technically was unauthorized, it was not directed by a formal committee
                    of union officials; rather, an ad hoc committee of about ten members was put together to coordinate
                    the effort. This committee met frequently during the strike. At no time was its membership revealed,

            <p>Regardless of who was directing affairs, the strike was effectively organized in its early stages. On
                    Sunday afternoon a mass meeting was held on the courthouse steps. Over three thousand people heard
                    several local union leaders urge members to support the labor holiday. The crowd also learned that a
                    last-minute attempt by the mayor to mediate the Columbian strike had failed when company officials
                    once again refused to participate. Union officials known to oppose a general strike were prevented
                    from speaking, and the crowd registered its approval of a total shutdown of the city. Throughout the
                    night preparations continued; ice, bread, and milk deliveries were made late Sunday night to beat
                    the 1:00 a.m. strike deadline.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>

            <p>The labor holiday began on schedule, with public transportation in the city shutting down at the
                    appointed hour. By mid-morning workers at the city's major industrial plants had been
                    informed that the strike was in progress and had walked out in support. Unionized employees of
                    restaurants, retail stores, gas stations, barber shops, and other businesses took part, and the few
                    establishments that attempted to stay open soon were visited by one of the bands of strikers
                    patrolling the city and told to close up. Few ignored the advice. Miners from the several area UMW
                    locals that were participating in the general strike played a major role in enforcing the shutdown.
                    Despite an attempt to sabotage a local power line, utility service to the city was uninterrupted;
                    hospitals and the post office were unaffected; drugstores were allowed to operate their prescription
                    counters but forced to close their soda fountains. Some local residents, anticipating trouble, had
                    laid in extra supplies, but others were able to travel to surrounding communities to buy gasoline
                    and food. Because of this, as well as the special Sunday night deliveries of perishables, few <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The initial response by government officials was calm. The prevailing orderliness meant that law
                    enforcement officers were able to keep the situation under control. However, leading businessmen and
                    manufacturers spent most of the day closeted in the office of the secretary of the Chamber of
                    Commerce. Alarmed by the situation, they pressured local officials to request that National Guard

            <p>Had those in charge of the strike been able to guarantee that it would be brief and could be brought
                    to an abrupt end on short notice, perhaps this appeal for outside help could have been forestalled.
                    The evident disagreement over how long the strike would continue lent an air of uncertainty to an
                    already tense situation and may well have fueled the belief that the National Guard would be needed.</p>
            <p>The request for troops received an immediate and favorable response. Democrat Paul V. McNutt was a

                    the terms of the martial law proclamation the county was put under control of the military

                    again. But throughout the day demonstrators gathered at the Columbian plant, where a large
                    contingent of troops was stationed. Three times guardsmen used tear gas and rifle butts to disperse
                    the crowds, and by the end of the day over 150 arrests had been made. Several minor injuries were
                        reported.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>

            <p>At the same time labor felt mounting pressure from other quarters to end the strike. International
                    unions continued to urge their <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> locals not to participate in the labor holiday.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> There also were
                    alarming reports that local employers were considering using the general strike as an excuse for
                    terminating the many union contracts that had been signed over the past two years.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Supporters of the labor holiday were also unable to derive much comfort from press coverage of the

                    general strike an "offense … against the community." According to the
                    newspaper, Governor McNutt's decision to send in the National Guard had been proper.
                    Clearly, the <hi rend="i">News</hi> editorialized, no responsible trade union leaders could be
                    involved in the situation, for such leaders would realize that the strike could only prejudice the
                    community against organized labor. The labor holiday was, rather, the work of a group of
                    "disturbers," local unionists frustrated by their inability to win a local strike
                    "and lacking the resourcefulness to engage either public or private mediators to bring
                    about a settlement." This view was typical of those expressed in regional newspapers during
                    and immediately after the strike. The <placeName>

                    unauthorized action perpetrated by people whose enthusiasm overruled their judgment and stressing
                    that "reason should not be abrogated by resort to force …." Perhaps the
                    most extreme view of the strike appeared in the <placeName>

            <p>At the same time hopes for a settlement of the Columbian strike seemed brighter. Upon hearing of the

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Department of Labor secretary Frances Perkins issued a statement placing primary
                    responsibility for the situation on the management of the enameling plant. Perkins dispatched
                    department conciliators Charles Richardson and Harry Scheck to the city to reopen negotiations in
                    the dispute. The chances that this could be accomplished seemed to improve a day or so later when
                    company president Gorby issued statements indicating his willingness to meet with employee
                    representatives and remove the special guards if adequate guarantees of protection for the plant
                    could be secured.<hi rend="sup">75</hi>

            <p>Despite the presence of the National Guard and the reopening of many local businesses and factories,
                    the general strike remained partially effective on Tuesday. By afternoon, though, the pressures from
                    union officials, state and local government, and public opinion for an end to it were becoming
                    irresistible. There were, moreover, disturbing reports that mine operators in the area were going to
                    protest to UMW president John L. Lewis about the walkouts of UMW locals in support of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> strikers, claiming that these walkouts violated the union's national contract.
                    Rumors also were spreading that groups of miners from outside the area were planning to come in to
                    participate in the shutdown and that attempts were going to be made to stop all gas and water
                        service.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> Day-long conferences between conciliators Scheck and Richardson,
                    union representatives, and Taylor finally brought the strike to an end. On the evening of Tuesday,
                    July 23, Taylor read over a local radio station a request from officers of the enameling plant union
                    that the general strike be stopped because it had accomplished its purpose and "the

                    of about five hundred gathered at the Columbian plant, only to be dispersed again by tear gas.<hi rend="sup">78</hi> The next day, however, things began to return to normal except for the
                    continued presence of several hundred troops. As it turned out, the main result of the general
                    strike was to be not a settlement of the Columbian dispute but a protracted period of martial law, a
                    situation which caused deep local divisions for several months.</p>
            <p>Under the terms of the governor's proclamation, all of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo County</region>
                    </placeName> was placed under the control of the military authorities; the county's civil
                    officials were technically agents of the military, and there was close cooperation between the two.
                    Military permission was required for public assemblies, no persons except police and military
                    personnel could carry weapons, and the authorities had the right (apparently little exercised) to
                    prevent persons from entering or leaving the county. Shortly after the end of the general strike
                    nearly all troops were removed from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and by the end of the week many martial law restrictions were being only loosely
                    enforced. The military commander remained behind after the soldiers departed, with local government
                    officials and law enforcement officers carrying out his directives.<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite frequently lax enforcement and the quick withdrawal of most guardsmen, the martial law
                    provisions had an immediate effect on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> labor. The declaration of martial law had not by itself broken the general strike: as
                    one newspaper noted, "the alacrity with which [local businessmen] got their cash registers
                    in operation" after the union statement ending the strike "left little doubt as to the
                    strength of the influences that had closed the city."<hi rend="sup">80</hi> Continued minor
                    disturbances in the city throughout the rest of the week also made it clear that many Terre Hauteans
                    were not intimidated by the soldiers and the suspension of civil government.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
                    But restrictions on gatherings did contribute to the pressure to end the strike by making illegal
                    the tactics that had been used to enforce it. The declaration of martial law also figured
                    prominently in press accounts of the crisis, contributing to the widespread picture of <placeName>

                    </placeName> remained a military district until the following February; because of its duration,
                    martial law itself became a political issue, eventually overshadowing even the Columbian strike.</p>
            <p>With the strike lost as an effective tool, solution of the Columbian dispute was left to the
                    Department of Labor. For several days the local press carried reports of the activities of the
                    conciliators, who conferred with local government officials, union representatives, and company
                    managers. Despite continued reports that negotiations were about to begin, it soon became clear that
                    the hopes of a negotiated settlement were futile. On August 1 Columbian president Gorby announced
                    that the firm would no longer discuss the strike with union representatives, federal conciliators,
                    or anyone else. He also announced that the plant was being "reorganized" and would resume
                    operations immediately; he promised that what he termed "former employees" would be given
                    preference in hiring as the company put together a new work force. Thanks to martial law the company
                    finally was able to reestablish an open shop.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> The union soon appealed its case
                    to the National Labor Relations Board.</p>
            <p>Feelings in the city continued to run high. Repeated minor disturbances occurred throughout August
                    and September, with frequent clashes between strikers and their replacements at the enameling plant.
                    Business leaders did little to help the situation by forming a "law and order committee"
                    and blaming the city's problems on "outlaws and radicals."<hi rend="sup">84</hi> There was strong support for the continuation of martial law as long as possible.<hi rend="sup">85</hi> The initial proclamation had brought McNutt a substantial amount of mail in
                    support of his decision; thereafter, any suspicion that martial law might be lifted brought a new
                    wave of letters urging that this action not be taken. In September, for instance, public protests
                    against martial law caused a number of residents to write to McNutt and ask, as one put it, for
                    continued protection from the "certain element, consisting of Reds, Agitators, Socialists,
                    etc. which has infested our fair city …,"<hi rend="sup">86</hi>

            <p>The issue of martial law itself assumed growing importance as it became clear that military rule
                    would not be ended quickly. To labor, martial law was a strikebreaking tactic, and by mid-August
                    unionists and leftists throughout the area viewed its continuation as a grave threat. Thus far,
                    local Socialists had not played a major role in the events surrounding the general strike; the
                    Socialist organization in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> seems to have been small and the Communist group still smaller at this time.<hi rend="sup">87</hi> Soon, however, Socialists began to see the continuation of martial law as a
                    potentially important civil liberty issue, and they staged demonstrations in defiance of military
                    regulations. These demonstrations in some cases led to the arrest of party members.<hi rend="sup">88</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On August 28 Powers Hapgood, a labor organizer and Socialist party official from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, announced that an unauthorized protest meeting would be held in <placeName>

                    incident on August 29; before it began, military authorities announced that they would not
                    interfere. A crowd of two thousand gathered on the courthouse lawn to hear the labor and Socialist
                    speakers denounce martial law as an unwarranted interference with free speech. Thomas argued that
                    "the fact that martial law is being maintained without troops is an admission that martial
                    law is not needed here." The suspension of civil liberties was, he said, "the
                    manner in which fascism gradually gets under way, and it means the starting out of a lot of
                    ‘Hoosier Hitlers.’ "<hi rend="sup">90</hi> This meeting marked the
                    beginning of a temporary labor-Socialist alliance against military rule, an alliance which
                    subsequently was formalized with the organization of the Labor-Socialist Defense Committee.<hi rend="sup">91</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the following weeks the Defense Committee conducted a two-pronged campaign against martial
                    law. One tool was publicity: through articles and press releases the group presented the reasons it
                    opposed martial law and condemned Governor McNutt for allowing it to continue.<hi rend="sup">92</hi>

            <p>The Columbian strikers had no better luck with their resort to legal channels. In October union
                    officials announced that they had been notified that their case would be heard as soon as a new
                    Regional Labor Board was created under the provisions of the Wagner Act. The union alleged that the
                    Columbian company's refusal to negotiate constituted an unfair labor practice as defined by
                    that act and that the company had in other ways interfered with the rights of employees. Hearings
                    began in December, and in February the Regional Labor Board upheld the union's contentions
                    and ordered the Columbian Enameling and Stamping Company to re-hire striking employees and bargain
                    with the union. The victory was, however, only temporary. A federal court subsequently ruled that
                    the union had violated the no-strike clause of its contract by calling a walkout in March, 1935;
                    that, in so striking, the union had ceased to be a legal bargaining agent; and that because the
                    union had lost its legal standing in March it could not be covered by the Wagner Act, which was
                    passed later. This decision was upheld on a technical point by the Supreme Court. Left without legal
                    status, the union had no channels of appeal left.<hi rend="sup">94</hi>

                    leaders of the Central Labor Union made clear their intention of fostering the "orderly

                    the new attitude expressed in the Chamber's advertisement promised "a better

                    later when early in 1938 the Junior Chamber of Commerce brought together business leaders and labor

                    </placeName> movement. This informal group, originally concerned only with the general goal of civic
                    improvement, eventually placed particular emphasis on improving local labor relations. No complex
                    mediation plan was involved; rather, members of the organization used their influences to encourage
                    and facilitate negotiation of labor disputes. The plan seems to have been effective: the city
                    enjoyed labor peace throughout the late 1930s and during the war years, a situation no doubt aided
                    by a small economic recovery in this period.<hi rend="sup">98</hi>

                    problems began well before 1935 and were a cause, rather than a result, of the general strike. The
                    city's reputation as a labor stronghold also predated the strike. The labor holiday may
                    have hurt <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s name among employers, as many have contended; but at the same time it was
                    followed by a period of labor peace, a concerted effort by labor and business to foster economic
                    growth, and a significant if limited economic recovery, all of which generated favorable
                        publicity.<hi rend="sup">101</hi> Any attempt to balance these consequences is necessarily
                    conjectural; it does seem, however, that there has been little substantiation of the view that the
                    general strike did serious, long-term economic damage to <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>A final, ironic aspect of the local mythology surrounding the events of 1935 is the still-common
                    belief that the general strike was the product of "mob hysteria."<hi rend="sup">102</hi> In fact, the strike was a rational, albeit desperate, response to a seemingly
                    insoluble problem. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s unionists came to see the strike at Columbian Enameling and Stamping as a
                    crisis in local labor relations. Appealing to the federal government for what they believed were
                    their rights under the NIRA, they were stymied by the paralysis created by the Schechter decision.
                    Turning to the local level, they found their own city government allying itself with the forces they
                    believed were attempting to crush organized labor. Even influential fellow citizens were either
                    unwilling or unable to help break the deadlock in the Columbian dispute. With all of these avenues
                    closed, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s trade unionists fell back upon their last resource, their newfound
                    solidarity. In the end even this was not enough.</p>

            <p>Throughout Indiana and the Midwest documentation of the effect of agricultural mechanization on rural
                    history is crucial to an understanding of the evolution of rural areas from their pioneer,
                    tradition-oriented origins to the largely agribusiness, innovative present. One technological
                    advance that initiated processes of adaptation and response was the mechanical grain separator or
                    threshing machine. The "separator," as it is named in rural areas, is a machine
                    that automatically sorts harvested cereals into their three main components—grain seed,
                    chaff, and straw. Threshing machines were adopted throughout the Midwest in relatively large numbers
                    in the 1850s.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> With this device, powered at first by horses, then by steam
                    engines, and finally by gas engines around 1925 in most areas, grain fit for mill or market was
                    delivered out of the side of the machine while the chaff and straw exited from the rear.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Separators enabled farmers to increase the amount of grain threshed during one
                    season with far less labor input per bushel.</p>

                        only the separation of the wheat heads from the straw whereas the cleaning of the chaff from the
                        kernal was called "separating." Early threshing machines, sometimes called
                        "groundhog" threshers because of their physical posture and noise, did not clean the
                        chaff. By the turn of the century machines completing both processes were referred to
                        synonymously as threshing machines or separators.</item>

            <p>Unlike the wheat drill or other agricultural innovations of the mid-nineteenth century, threshing
                    machines were complex and expensive implements. Most farmers were unable to afford or care for the
                    device, and even those who could do so found it impractical to put out money for an outfit that
                    could thresh their crop in one or two days. One solution was the creation of cooperative threshing
                    rings. Best summarized as neighborhood cooperatives, these collectives allowed each farmer-member to
                    help other ring participants with their threshing and thus be entitled to receive his
                    neighbors' help when the separator and power arrived at his farm. In some cases the ring
                    purchased a threshing rig themselves with the cost split among members; more often an outside
                    thresherman who owned the necessary machinery was employed to work through the harvest.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    derives from the Plains' location on the southern border of the Illinois Glacier boundary
                    line. Settled first in the 1810s,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> the White Plains neighborhood quickly
                    developed into an active, diversified farming area. Until the post-World War II period the
                    overwhelming majority of family farms occupied 80 to 160 acres, enough land to meet the needs of the
                    resident family and to support the development of a small market interest. The mixed <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Anglo-American population that dominated settlement during the mid-nineteenth
                    century could acquire cash by selling dairy products, livestock, or crop surpluses.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Grains, especially wheat and oats, along with corn, were primary farm and market crops until
                    the 1940s. Of the cereals, wheat was generally the most profitable cash crop. It also provided the
                    family with an important foodstuff and was mixed into some livestock feeds. The straw provided a raw
                    material for bedding and winter shelters for the stock. Unspoiled straw mixed with chaff, bran, or
                    some other supplement could be used as a basic winter feed. Oats were similarly used as a nutritious
                    feed for the farm's horses, and oat straw, even more than wheat straw, was favored by stock
                    as winter food. The only other cereals grown in the area were buckwheat and rye; neither grain ever
                    gained any real popularity among area farmers.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Prior to 1920 there apparently was no formally organized White Plains Threshing Ring with elected
                    officers, by-laws, or secretary's minutes. For many years before this date, however,
                    neighbors did exchange labor during the threshing season. Like most threshing rings of the
                    nineteenth century, the White Plains organizational network was informal, and information was passed
                    solely by word-of-mouth from season to season. Three major reasons appear to have motivated area
                    farmers to become more organized. First, according to Basil Copes, a former ring member,
                    inequalities existed in the amounts of grain raised by members of the same ring. Those men with

                    than these same men were required to do at the smaller places. A major concern, then, was to
                    equalize this labor difference by providing the farmer who worked smaller acreages reimbursement for
                    his extra labor at the bigger farms. The solution was the "difference" system. Although the
                    exact workings of the White Plains ring's system are not known, the "difference"
                    formula was based on comparisons of each ring member's total yields. The secretary of the
                    ring kept a close account of these figures and taxed a "difference" to farmers with larger
                    yields on the basis of a fixed amount per 100 bushels. Thus, in a hypothetical situation, if the
                    rate was fifteen cents per 100 bushels and Farmer A's crop yielded 341 bushels and Farmer B
                    harvested 544 bushels, then B would owe A a total of thirty cents if both men donated the same level
                    of labor. Labor rates for the annual run for both ring members and hired men were based on bushels
                    threshed and not on hours worked. By paying this way each farmer could quickly estimate how much he
                    owed by dividing his yield by the rate of "difference" and multiplying this figure by the
                    total number of hands. At the end of the threshing season, however, not all ring members exchanged
                    debts. The secretary, whose computations were rarely challenged, attempted to cancel balancing debts
                    wherever possible. After 1931 the cost of meals eaten by ring members was added to the labor and
                    yield aspects of this system. Farmers were charged by the "plate," and these debts
                    were also taken into account at the end of the season. According to Copes, those farmers who raised
                    around twenty acres of grain would generally neither pay out nor receive any
                        "difference."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The White Plains "difference" system was outlined in the ring's by-laws, a short
                    document (apparently no longer existing) that contained rules for the ring's yearly and
                    daily activities.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> It is likely that the by-laws solved a second major concern
                    of area farmers—the need to provide greater consistency in member's activities
                    from year to year and to provide a continuous structure outlining procedures and responsibilities.

                            </placeName>, Indiana, February 6, 1981. The process of figuring "difference" in
                            the White Plains ring was apparently a well-kept secret, known only to the three ring
                            secretaries—Frank Moore, Harry Green, and William Suhre. No former ring members
                            alive today remember ever learning it. Rundles discusses a few ways of figuring
                            "differences" in "The Thrashing Ring in the Cornbelt,"

                            requirements, were periodically published in farm magazines and journals. For examples, see

                    <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-080-3-045"/> the by-laws included regulations on the selection process for
                    labor tasks, the times for beginning and ending the work day, the instructions concerning the
                    expenditure of funds, and the selection process and responsibilities of ring officers, committees,
                    and thresherman. With these by-laws, and the simple parliamentary procedure used during business
                    portions of the organization and settlement meetings, ring members forged a more highly structured
                    and formal work exchange than had existed previously. In contrast to the loose networks underlying
                    the older cooperative patterns, the newer system parallels the increasing complexity of agricultural
                    technology and tasks.</p>
            <p>The increasing mobility of rural families and the growing number of farm renters in the White Plains
                    neighborhood provided a third reason for the change to a more structured relationship for the
                    threshing ring in the 1920s. By this decade between 20 and 25 percent of each year's
                    membership were renters, a figure perhaps two or three times higher than a generation before. The
                    by-laws provided a clearly understood threshing system that could be changed only by a majority
                        vote.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The ring's core membership thereby assured themselves of a
                    continuous system unalterable by any new minority. In 1920 the White Plains ring included nine
                    families—Copes, Nierstheimer, Roberts, Green, McWhorter, Swift, Moore, Younts, and
                    Klipple—that had been residing in the area prior to 1873.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                    Established farmers, who owned their own farms, retained tight control of the ring throughout its
                    twenty-four-year history. This core consisted of the Copes, Green, Nierstheimer, Gesell, Fritz,
                    Hoffman, Suhre, Roemer, and Pfaff families.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Although more than fifty family
                    names appear in the ring minutes, the officers were, with only two exceptions, filled from this
                    group. This continuity resulted in strong control over the difference system, the treasury, and the
                    progression of meetings and procedures that characterized the threshing season.</p>
            <p>In addition to the by-laws and formalized structure of the White Plains ring as organized in 1920,
                    there existed a perhaps larger, albeit unofficial, set of ring rules based on the area's
                    traditions, values, and attitudes in regard to work exchanges and social relations. The strength of
                    these "rules" cannot be overestimated. Because new ring members often were not aware of

                    difficult to follow than the by-laws. One new White Plains member, for example, violated the
                    tradition that bundle wagon drivers always unload their bundles at the same side of the separator:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We had one old fellow here in the neighborhood, well he moved in here that one year. The
                            first year he was my partner [with the bundle wagons]. When you started in as pairs, the
                            same ones stayed all through the ring. You got a fellow that stayed on the opposite side of
                            you at the machine and you stayed on your side. You was supposed to go that way all through
                            the wheat. If you got the dust in over at a threshing, why the wind would change at the
                            various places. And we started in and he didn't have as large a load of bundles as
                            I did and he wasn't no fool either I found out afterwards. He got on the clean side
                            which you had that privilege on the first time. But the second time we came in he came in on
                            my side and I thought, "Well he's just new to the ring and he
                            isn't thinking too well. Now I'll wait till tomorrow." And the
                            next day, the same thing. So I told him. I said, "We've got a little rule
                            here that whichever side of the separator you start out on, you go through on that till the
                            end of the ring." "Well," he said, "that dust hurts my
                            eyes." "Well, it don't do mine any good either," I told
                                him.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Organization and settlement meetings marked the opening and closing of the White Plains threshing
                    season. Both events took place at the Ebenezer Methodist Episcopal Church in Blooming Grove
                    Township. Approximately ten days before the threshing rig was due to arrive in the area, the
                    president called the organization meeting. As the minutes indicate, the primary purposes of this
                    gathering were to elect ring officers for the coming year, apportion labor tasks to ring members,
                    hire extra laborers if needed, and admit new members into the ring. The Machine Committee reported
                    on the thresherman whom they had hired and the prices agreed upon for the season's run.
                    This meeting generally took place in the evening and rarely lasted longer than two hours.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The key element of the organization meeting was the selection of the labor positions that each man
                    kept throughout that season. Before 1922 the captain of the ring placed the men. In that year
                    members voted to choose their positions by lot. After the positions were randomly selected, ring
                    members could trade their selections if two men agreed to an exchange.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> This
                    flexibility explains what seem in the minutes to be uncanny streaks of continuous job selections.
                    Howard Roemer, for example, a heavyset man who preferred to work with the bundle wagons, managed
                    either to draw that job or to trade for it for sixteen of his seventeen years in the ring.</p>

            <p>The major threshing tasks divided among ring members were bundle wagon or sheaf wheat team drivers,
                    pitchers, grain handlers, and grain wagon drivers. The bundle wagoners worked in teams. Their job
                    was to drive their wagons into the fields where the pitchers' main task was to pitch the
                    bundles onto the wagons. The driver arranged the sheaves on the wagon bed, taking care to build an
                    even load that would not tip over when the wagon was driven from the field to the separator,
                    normally positioned near the barn. The threshing machine feeding carrier extended from the front,
                    and bundles could be pitched by the drivers from either side. Working as a team, the feeders
                    alternated pitching their sheaves, always heads first, into the cutting teeth of the separator.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> After the grain worked its way through the machine, the grain seeds were
                    carried by internal elevators to a grain weigher at the side. As the automatic weighers ticked off
                    the kernels, half-bushel by half-bushel, the wheat handlers sacked the grain in two-bushel bags.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> These sacks were then placed in grain wagons, driven to the farmer's
                    granary, and unloaded. Occasionally the grain was not sacked but exited down a spout from the
                    machine directly into the wagon box.</p>
            <p>The minimum number of workers needed for the White Plains ring was seventeen. There were always eight
                    bundle wagons and two grain wagons. The remaining men were assigned to pitching bundles or to
                    handling the threshed grain, with the majority working as field pitchers. The bundle wagon tasks
                    required the most skill and expertise, primarily in loading the wagons and pitching the sheaves into
                    the separator. Hired labor, usually high school students or beginning farmers, generally worked as
                    pitchers or grain wagon drivers.</p>
            <p>Within the threshing ring hierarchy the captain held a unique position. He acted as a foreman over
                    the ring members and harvest activities, though he was always careful to respect the rights of the
                    thresherman who bossed the rig crew. The captain worked around the separator, feeding bundles of
                    grain that either fell from the bundle wagons or missed the feeding carrier when pitched from the
                    wagons. Perhaps most importantly, the captain was responsible for directing the season's
                    threshing route. The ring's <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">17</hi> Self-feeding carriers were available on most separators by the turn
                            of the century. Before that time the sheaves' binds had to be cut by hand and the
                            grain fed manually. This process required three extra workers—two men, one on
                            each side of the machine, to cut the bundle ties and one man to feed the open bundles into
                            the separator.</item>

                    either the northern or southern edge of the area. This pattern prevented any one member from
                    suffering annual anxiety because he was at the end of the run and thus was more likely to suffer
                    grain losses because of summer storms or hail. The captain also selected when and where ring meals
                    would be eaten and decided the starting and ending time for each day's activities.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>The owner of the threshing rig was the ideal role model for many boys throughout the rural Midwest
                    during this period. Interestingly, the thresherman did not operate the threshing machine itself;
                    rather, he controlled the powerful steam or gasoline engine that powered the separator. William
                    Scherer, the thresherman for the White Plains ring for over twenty-five years, lived only two miles
                    east of the neighborhood. Scherer threshed for two rings in the area, each year alternating the ring
                    he threshed first. His long involvement with the White Plains farmers reflects the tendency of
                    threshing rings to establish long-term relationships with the thresherman who best suited their
                        requirements.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scherer's rig crew consisted of himself, as engineer, a separator tender,<hi rend="sup">21</hi> and a blowerman. The engineer, when working with steam engines, was assisted by a wagonman
                    whose major task involved driving the water tank between the engine and the nearest water source to
                    replenish the boilers of the thirsty steamer. The separator tender kept the threshing machine
                    running smoothly. He could generally be found either standing on top of the separator, where he
                    listened for any abnormal sounds and felt the bundles moving through the machine, or working around
                    the machine with oilcan, grease gun, or adjusting tools. The blowerman labored at the rear of the
                    machine from which a metal stack directed the air-driven expulsion of straw and chaff. By
                    manipulating cranks that directed the angle, direction, and height of the blowing waste, he
                    attempted to build an even and solid straw pile.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Before the threshing rig

                            donations among farmers although the number of workers needed was less than that required
                            for threshing. Small informal rings were developed, but only a minority of the White Plains
                            Threshing Ring members participated as all did not raise hay or have silos on their farms.

                    barnyards. By building the straw pile around and on top of the structures, the blowerman could
                    create a cozy wintering place for the stock. The farm's straw pile, incidentally, also
                    supplied other neighborhood visitors with a measure of a farmer's grain crop and, by
                    extension, his prosperity.</p>
            <p>A summary of the number of bushels of grain threshed per year and the average number of bushels
                    threshed per farm is given in Table 1. Because of the methods necessarily employed in their
                    reckoning, these statistics are only approximations. "Numbers of Farms" for each season was
                    determined from the number of men given positions, including captain, as members of the ring.
                    "Number of Bushels Threshed" is more problematic. Only for the years 1928 and 1929 did the
                    secretary include these figures in the actual minutes of the settlement meetings. In 1931 a figure
                    assumed to be the number of bushels threshed was added as an "extra" at the bottom of the
                    minutes page; the 1940 total was listed on a miscellaneous settlement page in the back of the
                    minutes volume. For the other years the number of bushels threshed was figured on the basis of wage
                    rate for hired hands. For example, in 1938 the hired laborers were paid thirty cents for every 100
                    bushels threshed. The secretary reports that each man was paid $12.90, a figure that
                    suggests 4,300 bushels threshed that season. Use of this system assumes, of course, that the hired
                    men did not miss any of the threshing and that monies paid were for threshing only. Although Basil
                    Copes reports that these men rarely missed any work,<hi rend="sup">23</hi> the equation likely
                    contains a small percentage of error. It is possible to check the use of the labor rate system just
                    described with figures given by the secretary for 1928, 1929, 1931, and 1940. These computations are
                    found in Table 2 and show, at least for these years, that the level of error is extremely slight.</p>
            <p>Within a week after threshing the last bundle of grain, the settlement meeting occurred. Until 1931,
                    when members voted to end the social time, this event combined both business and social functions.
                    Whole families were involved. The meeting began with the men gathered outside the church to
                    "settle-up" their differences. Hired hands received their wages, and ring members voted on
                    the thresherman that they wanted to work the ring the following year. The Machine Committee,
                    appointed by the president at this time, was entrusted with the task of contacting the selected
                    thresherman and fixing the cost of the next year's run. <list type="footnotes">

                    their business, they moved inside to join their families, a symbolic gesture to signal the end of

                    renewal of friendships and neighborhood bonds.</p>

            <p>Between 1921 and 1944 certain trends in ring activities reflect other economic and social changes
                    both in agriculture and general rural social patterns. The peak of prosperity and normalcy in ring
                    activities occurred between the ring's formal organization and the Depression period.
                    Membership during this time averaged eighteen families, and the members never had to hire more than
                    one extra worker. Membership, however, did decline from a peak of twenty-one in 1921 to sixteen in
                    1930. The decrease resulted mainly from the loss of farms located on the ring's northwest
                    and western borders [see Figure 1]. When these farms changed hands, their new owners or renters, if
                    they continued to need a thresherman, joined other nearby rings.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> After the
                    increase in wheat prices brought about by World War I, the market stabilized in the 1920s. Although

                    the high market prices. After dropping to twenty-five cents in 1921 as market prices went down, the
                    rate of "difference" remained constant through 1930.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beginning in 1931 and continuing through 1937 the minutes reflect the impact of the Depression. In
                    1931 the "difference" rate dropped to twenty cents per 100 bushels, and the next year the
                    level fell another five cents. From 1932 until 1937, when wheat prices began to rise again, the
                    "difference" rate remained at fifteen cents per 100 bushels, the lowest level in ring
                    history. Wages paid to hired labor also parallel the tightening of the money supply during this
                    period. From a high of thirty-five cents per 100 bushels threshed in 1929 and 1930, labor rates
                    declined to twenty-five cents in 1931 and fifteen cents in 1932. This low level continued until 1937
                    when the rate doubled, thereby jumping back close to the pre-Depression scale.</p>
            <p>The decline in ring membership that began in the late 1920s continued through the next decade. In the
                    early 1930s some farmers stopped raising cereal crops; in addition, a new generation of farmers who
                    depended on tractors for their farm power and corn for their cash crop purchased or rented the farms
                    of former ring members. The introduction of soybeans into the area in the mid-1930s also resulted in
                    a decrease of acreage devoted to grains. By the late 1930s threshing rings throughout the Midwest
                    were becoming dysfunctional as pull-type combines were successfully adapted for use on small farms
                    where the Ford and John Deere tractors increasingly provided the power source. Relatively
                    inexpensive and highly efficient, the pull-type combine cut and threshed grains in a single sweep of
                    the field, thus freeing individual farmers from the necessity of engaging in cooperative labor to
                    complete the grain harvest.</p>
            <p>Entering the 1940s, the White Plains ring membership was down to almost half its 1921 number. The
                    remaining members were mainly those core farmers who had dominated the ring from its inception.
                    Instead of finding themselves without reason to continue the ring process at this
                    time—when during many years there were almost as many hired hands as
                    members—the ring farmers were again motivated to continue grain production by the
                    shortages created by a major world war. The organization and settlement <list type="footnotes">

                    dinners together, although for the final two years this meal was not prepared by the host farm but
                    was delivered at noontime by wives and children.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> In 1941 "due to the
                    lack of members the position of Capt. was discontinued." In 1944 some long-time members
                    such as Basil Copes, Andrew Knecht, and Will Suhre invested in a small separator and gasoline
                    tractor that could be operated by three or four men. Other ring members purchased combines to
                    harvest their share of the wartime crops. The minutes of the White Plains Threshing Ring were put
                    away by the last secretary, Suhre. In the late 1960s, when an individual farmer could harvest his
                    entire acreage from the dust-free, sound-proofed cab of a self-propelled combine, the Suhre family
                    passed the minutes to Copes, the last ring treasurer. It was perhaps as much the conservative
                    natures of the White Plains farmers as their concern for history that led them to preserve the
                    record of their threshing ring. Whatever the reason, however, the minutes provide an insight into
                    that transitional period in Indiana's rural history when agricultural innovations and
                    traditional patterns coexisted most harmoniously.</p>

                            difference between the amount of bushels counted on the machine weigher, which provided the
                            basis for the thresherman's costs, and the amount of bushels credited to the farmer
                            who brought his grain to local markets. Basil Copes remembers this incident well; he passes
                            it off as a small problem involving only two or three ring members. Interview with Basil

                    </placeName> in 1855, Eugene Victor Debs is one of Indiana's best known, but least
                    appreciated, native sons. Like his fellow Terre Hautean, Theodore Dreiser, Debs the socialist has
                    been something of an embarrassment to many Hoosiers, but as he becomes more and more of a historical
                    figure and less of a living reality—he died nearly sixty years ago—this
                    attitude seems to be on the wane. With the publication of Nick Salvatore's
                    Bancroft-prize-winning biography in 1982 and the appearance of the microfilm edition of <hi rend="i">The Papers of Eugene V. Debs</hi> the following year, a revival of interest in the Indiana
                    socialist appears to be underway.</p>
            <p>The son of Jean Daniel and Marguerite Marie Bettrich Debs, both immigrants from the Alsace, Gene left
                    school at the age of fourteen to work on the railroads, first as a painter and later as a fireman.
                    Even after his brief career on the rails—it lasted only five years—he remained
                    active in the Vigo Lodge of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, rising rapidly to become national
                    secretary and editor of its magazine.</p>
            <p>Debs began his career as a conservative trade unionist, taking a dim view of strikes and cultivating
                    worker-management cooperation. <list type="footnotes">

               </figure> Debs's role model during these years was William Riley McKeen, a banker and owner
                    of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad. In 1885 Debs married Katherine Metzel, the stepdaughter of a respectable
                    local druggist, and built her a fine home that later attracted much criticism from opponents both
                    within and outside the socialist movement. For a time Debs was a promising Democratic politician,
                    winning two terms as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute city</settlement>
                    </placeName> clerk and one term in the state legislature. His experience in that august body, where
                    the bills he introduced on railroad labor reform were mercilessly watered down in the Senate, left
                    him with a jaundiced view of politics.</p>
            <p>Unlike most men Debs became more radical as he grew older. By the late 1880s he had dropped his
                    opposition to strikes and had come to regard the railroad brotherhoods as ineffective craft unions
                    frequently more at odds with one another than with their employers. In 1892 he resigned as secretary
                    of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and helped form the American Railway Union, which ignored
                    craft lines and united all railroad workers into one organization. The new union was very
                    successful, recruiting 150,000 members in less than a year and defeating James <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-080-3-080"/> J. Hill's powerful Great Northern Railroad in an eighteen-day
                    strike. These successes proved only temporary. In 1894 the union made the fateful decision to
                    boycott Pullman cars in support of a strike of the company's workers at Pullman, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The union was crushed in the face of an overwhelming combination of corporate
                    opposition, federal troops, and court injunctions.</p>
            <p>The Pullman strike was a turning point in Debs's life. He was convicted of defying a federal
                    injunction that forbade his participation in all strike activities and spent six months in the
                    Woodstock, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, jail. This gave him time to reflect on the inequities of the capitalist system. A
                    parade of visitors came to see the imprisoned union leader. Many were prominent socialists such as
                    Victor Berger of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milwaukee</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Thomas J. Morgan of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Keir Hardie of <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>. He read many books during this period and later claimed to have been deeply influenced
                    by Karl Kautsky, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> popularizer of Karl Marx. A year after his release Debs publicly announced his
                    conversion to socialism. "The issue is Socialism versus Capitalism," he wrote in
                    the January 1, 1897, issue of the <hi rend="i">Railway Times.</hi> "I am for Socialism
                    because I am for humanity."</p>
            <p>Debs's career as a socialist is well known. Five times he was the Socialist party's
                    presidential candidate. In 1912 he won 6 percent of the total vote, the highest ever given a
                    Socialist candidate. In 1920 he campaigned from behind the walls of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> penitentiary and won nearly a million votes. He remained a champion of industrial
                    unionism throughout his career and, despite his decision to embrace a creed which most of them
                    rejected, remained very popular among rank-and-file workers.</p>
            <p>In his famous Canton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, speech in June, 1918, Debs condemned World War I as a class war fought for the benefit
                    of the capitalists at the expense of the workers. This was little different from what he had said in
                    previous speeches, but on this occasion the federal government deemed his remarks sufficiently
                    disloyal to warrant prosecution under the Espionage Act. Debs was convicted and spent two and a half
                    years behind bars—most of them in the federal penitentiary in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName>. During his trial Debs repeated his famous remark: "While there is a lower
                    class, I am in it, while there is a criminal element I am of it, and while there is a soul in
                    prison, I am not free." These words may sound maudlin and melodramatic to the modern ear,
                    but they were sincere. The socialist became a popular figure among both prisoners and prison guards.
                    Inmates frequently sought his advice and help. Prison officials often turned to Debs to assist in
                    counseling difficult prisoners. Outside the walls supporters launched a nationwide campaign to seek
                    his release, but it was not until Warren G. Harding assumed the presidency that the socialist
                    received a pardon.</p>
            <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-080-3-081"/>
            <p>Debs spent his last years as the head of a party torn apart by internal dissension and scorned by a
                    hostile public. Although he remained active until nearly the end, his magic had begun to fade, and
                    he spoke to dwindling audiences. He died at Lindlahr Sanitarium outside of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> on October 20, 1926.</p>
            <p>Debs's biographers have treated him well, portraying the socialist leader as a heroic figure
                    motivated almost solely by a desire to improve the lot of those crushed down by the emerging
                    capitalist-industrialist society. It is difficult not to conclude from their works that Debs was
                    indeed a compassionate man with a profound and genuine concern for his fellow human beings. James
                    Whitcomb Riley, a close friend and drinking companion, captured this aspect of his personality in
                    his poem "Regardin' Terry Hut": <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>And there's 'Gene Debs—a man ‘at stands And
                            jes’ holds out in his two hands As warm a heart as ever beat Betwixt here and the

                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The earliest biographies, such as David Karsner's <hi rend="i">Debs: His Authorized Life and
                        Letters</hi> (1919) and McAlister Coleman's <hi rend="i">Eugene V. Debs: A Man
                    Unafraid</hi> (1930), are unabashed hagiographies. Even Ray Ginger's 1949 volume, <hi rend="i">The Bending Cross,</hi> a fine book long considered the standard biography, is
                    uncritically admiring. Only very recently have writers begun to treat Debs as anything like a
                    flesh-and-blood human being. While Bernard J. Brommel's <hi rend="i">Eugene V. Debs:
                        Spokesman for Labor and Socialism</hi> (1978) is as adoring as most previous works, it brings to
                    light for the first time Debs's affair with Mabel Curry, the wife of an Indiana State
                    University professor. David A. Corbin's article "Betrayal in the West Virginia
                    Coal Fields: Eugene V. Debs and the Socialist Party of America, 1912–1914,"
                    which appeared in the <hi rend="i">Journal of American History</hi> in 1978, broke sharply with the
                    literature on Debs by suggesting that he was not such a nice guy after all. Corbin accuses the
                    socialist of betraying rank-and-file coal miners in the interests of maintaining good relations with
                    the United Mine Workers union hierarchy. The most recent, and best, biography of Debs is Nick
                    Salvatore's <hi rend="i">Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and Socialist</hi> (1982). Although
                    certainly an admiring biographer, Salvatore deals perceptively with some of the less attractive
                    aspects of the socialist's life and character. These include his need for the constant
                    support and unquestioned loyalty of those near him, his inability to confront friends on political
                    issues, and his gradually cooling relationship with his wife. Salvatore's Debs is <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-080-3-082"/> a warm and compassionate man, but he is also a far more complex
                    and interesting human being than has been seen before.</p>
            <p>The latest entry into Debs scholarship is the microfilm edition of <hi rend="i">The Papers of Eugene
                        V. Debs, 1834–1945,</hi> edited by J. Robert Constantine and Gail Malmgreen and
                    published by the Microfilming Corporation of America. This collection should play an important role
                    in the continuing reevaluation of the life and career of this American socialist leader. The
                    collection is the product of the Debs Papers Project which began in 1979 and was completed with the
                    assistance of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Historical Publications and
                    Records Commission. Constantine, a professor of history at Indiana State University, is currently at
                    work on a three-volume edition of selected Debs correspondence.</p>
            <p>The microfilm collection, consisting of twenty-three reels, is divided into three series:
                    correspondence, published writings and speeches, and scrapbooks. A useful guide containing a
                    chronology of Debs's life, a biographical sketch, select bibliography, index, and checklist
                    accompanies the collection.</p>
            <p>A disappointingly small number of reels, only five, make up the correspondence in Series I. This is
                    certainly not the fault of Contantine and Malmgreen who conducted an exhaustive nationwide search to
                    locate Debs's correspondence. It is rather a testimony to the difficulty of locating
                    materials relating to even major figures of the American left. The editors further point out that
                    the "volume of surviving correspondence dating from the early years of Debs'
                    career is thin compared to that of his later years" (p. 39). Indeed it is. Reel one runs from 1834
                    to 1914. Even so, the collected correspondence is of unquestioned value not only in understanding
                    Debs's life but also for studies of American radicalism in general. A cursory check in the
                    index of David A. Shannon's <hi rend="i">The Socialist Party of America</hi> (1955) reveals
                    that out of a sample of sixty-six names, forty-one showed up as correspondents in the Debs
                    collection.</p>
            <p>The editors were obviously not under pressure to be selective in including letters. They indicate
                    that no "known correspondence to or from any member of the Debs family has been excluded
                    from this microfilm edition" (p. 40). The very large number of letters to and from Theodore Debs is
                    worthy of comment. Theodore acted as his brother's secretary, confidant, and alter ego. His
                    letters, according to the editors, "should be considered Eugene's correspondence"
                    (p. 39). Theodore has been badly slighted by historians, particulary by Ginger. Salvatore is more
                    sensitive in his exploration of the relationship between the two brothers, but <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-080-3-083"/> Theodore remains a neglected figure in the history of American
                    radicalism.</p>
            <p>Each document in Series I is accompanied by a target card which gives the name of correspondent (a
                    boon to those with bad luck at deciphering signatures) as well as the location of the original. At
                    the end of this series, on reel five, is a collection of thirty-two reminiscences about Debs by men
                    and women, both prominent and not so prominent, who knew him. The guide to the collection includes
                    an index by correspondent and cross referencing where possible by geographic location.</p>
            <p>Series II (reels six to eight) consists of Debs's published writings and speeches. The
                    editors claim that this series "comprises the largest collection of Debs'
                    published writings … ever assembled" (p. 46). Debs was an accomplished and prolific
                    journalist, and his writings appeared in many periodicals. Constantine and Malmgreen scanned the
                    entire runs (when available) of twenty-two publications that frequently carried Debs material. This
                    series also includes items from scrapbooks, clipping files, and other sources. In addition to
                    published materials Series II includes some previously unpublished speeches. Among these are
                    verbatim notes of speeches taken by government agents who shadowed Debs's public
                    appearances during the war. The editors obtained these through the Freedom of Information Act. As in
                    the correspondence series, a target card accompanies each item and includes title, place, and date
                    of publication. Unfortunately, the target card does not include the entire name of the publication,
                    only an abbreviation. To find the name of the periodical one must look in the guide, an irritating
                    inconvenience. The guide includes a checklist, arranged alphabetically, of the titles of all
                    published articles and all speeches in Series II.</p>
            <p>Series III, which makes up the bulk of the collection (thirteen reels or about 62 percent of the
                    total), consists of scrapbooks and clippings which Eugene and Theodore Debs compiled over the years.
                    This material is reproduced from microfilm owned by the Tamiment Library at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> University. It is unfortunate that the largest part of the collection is the least
                    satisfactory. The material is poorly organized, and much of it is of questionable value. Even so,
                    important information may lie buried in these scrapbooks and clippings. The reel that this reviewer
                    sampled, reel twelve, contained correspondence relating to Debs's second imprisonment.
                    There are no target cards and no index for this series.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Papers of Eugene V. Debs</hi> joins a growing body of source materials on the
                    American left already microfilmed and widely available to researchers. Scholars will use this
                    collection for a <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-080-3-084"/> variety of purposes. In this
                    reviewer's mind one of the most pressing needs at the moment is a well-written biography
                    aimed at a general rather than an academic audience. Debs, once one of the most well-known and
                    admired men of his time, is fast fading from the popular consciousness. Americans need to be
                    reminded of his importance. Salvatore's new biography is excellent, but it is not in the
                    strict sense a personal biography. It is rather a "social biography" which admirably places
                    Debs within the broad context of his time and place. But however much Debs was a product of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he was in no way a typical Terre Hautean. A new biography is needed, one which will
                    help to explain more fully the strengths and weaknesses that made Debs an exceptional man.</p>

            <p>Gayle Thornbrough has been an important figure on the Indiana historical scene since she joined the
                    staff of the Indiana Historical Society as a recent college graduate in 1937. Her retirement at the
                    end of September, 1984, marks an important milestone for the society and provides an occasion for
                    reviewing her contributions to Indiana history.</p>
            <p>Born in Hendricks County, Indiana, on October 29, 1914, the daughter of engineer Harry C. Thornbrough
                    and Bess Tyler Thornbrough, Gayle Thornbrough grew up in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in a history-minded household. Like her older sister Emma Lou, Gayle Thornbrough was an
                    outstanding student at both Shortridge High School (class of 1932) and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University (B.A., 1936). In 1937 Thornbrough came to work as an editor for the Indiana
                    Historical Society, the society's first full-time employee. Except for a leave of absence
                    in the academic year 1941–1942 to complete a master's degree in history at the
                    University of Michigan and twenty months in 1967–1968 at the Library of Congress as a

                    spent working in Indiana history in the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
            <p>Thornbrough has brought to her work in state and local history impressive personal and intellectual
                    qualifications. There is nothing provincial or narrow about Gayle Thornbrough. Though she sometimes
                    observes, with a note of surprise in her voice, that she has lived "all my life in <placeName>

               </figure> and belles lettres, she is also a serious traveler, at home in many parts of the world.
                    She has been an exemplary citizen, publicly supporting civil rights and civil liberties during times
                    when it was unpopular to do so in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Her wide-ranging curiosity about the world combined with a broad acquaintance with
                    classical and modern literature has equipped Thornbrough to "do" state history on a high
                    level. These qualities have been reflected throughout her career.</p>
            <p>This remarkable career, spanning forty-seven years, falls into two basic periods: her years primarily
                    as an editor, 1937–1966, and her years primarily as an administrator, since 1968, with
                    special emphasis on the period since she assumed the undivided leadership of the society in 1976.</p>
            <p>Gayle Thombrough's contributions to Indiana history through her work as an editor are
                    enormous. They include both her work as the society's editor (1937–1966) and her
                    work for the Indiana Historical Bureau (1947–1966), the state-supported historical <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-080-3-087"/> agency which operated very closely with the society until 1976.
                    Beginning with her early assignments as editor of the society's pioneering <hi rend="i">Prehistory Research Series</hi>—the earliest scholarly publications on Indiana
                    archaeology—and continuing through the last volume of the <hi rend="i">Diary of Calvin
                        Fletcher,</hi> published in 1983, Thornbrough has brought to her work an outstanding level of
                    integrity, competence, industry, imagination, and good sense. The sheer quantity of her output is
                    impressive: in addition to the twenty-odd titles in which her name appears as editor, compiler,
                    coeditor, or author, there are more than fifty more works that she prepared for publication without
                    explicit acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>This "silent" preparation included scrupulous verification of the author's
                    research, checking footnote accuracy and direct quotations as well as evaluating inferences drawn
                    from the sources cited. Thornbrough's copyediting assignments often included either
                    extensive revision of texts or helpful suggestions and criticisms for authors leading to extensive
                    revision. In some instances in the past twenty or so years her "silent" editing has
                    consisted of the sort of guidance of research and writing usually associated with directors of
                    doctoral dissertations; this was her role, for example, in the preparation of the society's
                    sesquicentennial history, a lengthy scholarly study published in 1980. She was the copy editor for
                    the only book ever published by a historical society to win a Pulitzer prize: the lavishly
                    annotated, two-volume <hi rend="i">Old Northwest,</hi> written by R. C. Buley and published by the
                    society in 1950.</p>
            <p>Thornbrough's contribution to the monumental Angel Site, published by the society in 1967,
                    was crucial. Glenn A. Black, the society's longtime archaeologist, died suddenly in 1964,
                    with the manuscript of his life's work partly unfinished. To Thornbrough fell the extremely
                    complex task of commissioning chapters to fill in the areas Black had not yet written about and then
                    editing the entire work so as to achieve continuity of style. Because the entire set of original
                    illustrations and the dummy to which the set was keyed were stolen while in the printer's
                    possession, Thornbrough was called upon to perform the heroic task of replacing the 420 photographs
                    and figuring out where they belonged in the book. Despite these formidable obstacles,
                    Black's two-volume <hi rend="i">Angel Site</hi> was published in 1967 under
                    Thornbrough's oversight and was greeted with unambiguous acclaim.</p>
            <p>Important as these "silent" contributions to Indiana history and prehistory have been,
                    Thornbrough's national reputation was achieved by her accomplishments as an editor of
                    historical documents. The compilation, transcription, and annotation of historical <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-080-3-088"/> documents are very different sorts of undertakings from that of
                    copyediting. In the former case the editor has complete control over the shape and content of the
                    work, guided only by her or his judgment of what is historically significant and correct. (Whereas
                    in copyediting the editor is always subordinate to the author, in editing documents the editor is
                    subordinate only to the truth, like all historians.) Gayle Thornbrough has demonstrated an unusual
                    gift for identifying, assembling, and explaining significant documents in the history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, especially for the early period and for the Old Northwest. It is almost impossible to
                    work in Indiana history before the Civil War and not to base a significant part of one's
                    research on the documents edited by Gayle Thornbrough for the Indiana Historical Bureau (frequently
                    in collaboration with her older colleague, the fine historian Dorothy Riker). Included in the
                    landmark research tools that Thornbrough prepared either alone or with Riker are <hi rend="i">Journals of the General Assembly of Indiana Territory, 1805–1815</hi> (1950); <hi rend="i">Indiana Election Returns, 1816–1851</hi> (1960); and three volumes of the
                    indispensable messages and papers of the governors of Indiana series, including volumes on James <placeName>

                    Bigger, 1840–1843 (1964).</p>
            <p>Thornbrough's most distinctive achievements in editing, however, are her treatments of
                    projects that reflected the individual personalities and unique settings of historical figures in
                    trying times: the paramount examples are her volumes on the Josiah Harmar-John Francis Hamtramck
                    correspondence, 1787–1791, the record of the <placeName>

            <p>Thornbrough's greatest achievement in this kind of documentary editing has come in the
                    period after she assumed heavy administrative responsibilities and is eloquent testimony both to her
                    command of this area of historical research and her devotion to history: to wit, the magnificent
                    nine-volume <hi rend="i">Diary of Calvin</hi>
                    <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-080-3-089"/>
                    <hi rend="i">Fletcher.</hi> The Fletcher diary is probably unique in American letters for several
                    reasons: first, because it was written by a private and self-taught person who nevertheless had a
                    great deal to say worth hearing about public men and events and, second, because it was composed in
                    the Midwest by an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis city</settlement>
                    </placeName> father. While it is relatively rare for even "public"
                    persons—longtime holders of public office—to maintain thoughtful diaries for
                    significant periods of time (one thinks of John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName> Adams and Harold Ickes among the few who did so), it is virtually unheard of for a
                    private citizen with no strong personal claim to a substantial place in history to produce such a
                    document. Fletcher, a New Englander and "self-made" pioneer businessman, is such an
                    anomaly. His twelve quarto-sized manuscript volumes cover fifty years. In them the diarist grows
                    from frontier lawyer to wealthy and conscientious citizen, widely known and respected. Calvin
                    Fletcher knew everybody and had an opinion about everything in antebellum and Civil War <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and his diary is consequently the richest single source on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Indiana in this time period.</p>
            <p>Although the Fletcher diary has been long recognized by historians as an extremely rich document, its
                    very length and richness of detail posed obstacles to its publication. The document awaited the
                    leadership and editorial talents of Gayle Thornbrough to achieve its publication. When she returned
                    to the society as director of publications and the library in 1968, her first major publishing
                    project was to secure the rights to and to begin editorial research on the diary. From the
                    publication of the first volume in 1972 the diary's significance and the superb level of
                    annotation and meticulous research were recognized as the hallmarks of Thornbrough's
                    editorial style. The publication of the diary is itself an important event in American
                    historiography, and Thornbrough led the project from beginning to end.</p>
            <p>Thornbrough has also been an important teacher of editors. While her colleague Dorothy Riker recalls
                    that nobody taught Thornbrough to edit (Riker credits the veteran Nellie Armstrong Robertson with
                    her own training)—"she just sat down and started right in and always seemed to know what
                    she was doing"—her younger colleagues testify to her generous help in teaching them the
                    ropes. From Shirley Snyder McCord of the Indiana Historical Bureau to Paula Lents Corpuz of the
                    society, Thornbrough has been a gentle and an effective mentor to several generations of aspiring
                    editors.</p>
            <p>While Gayle Thornbrough has never abandoned historical editing altogether, her primary
                    responsibilities since 1968 have been administrative. That year she was made director of both the
                        <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-080-3-090"/> publications program and the library—which
                    together comprised the heart of the society's work—and in 1976 she was made
                    executive secretary and took over the leadership of all the society's programs. Her
                    accomplishments in both of these positions have been dramatic—perhaps especially so since
                    Thornbrough is a modest, even somewhat retiring person, who has always regarded herself primarily as
                    a historian rather than as an administrator.</p>
            <p>Under Thornbrough's leadership the Indiana Historical Society Library has grown from a small
                    understaffed institution with a largely uncataloged collection of books and manuscripts to a
                    well-staffed research library with its collections largely accessible to researchers. The library
                    has also formulated vigorous new collecting policies, reaching out to peoples previously
                    underrepresented in collections of Indiana history, like blacks and other ethnic groups, and looking
                    to some less traditional kinds of historical documents, like photographs. Thornbrough also planned
                    the modern facility in which the library is now housed, a building made possible by the gift of Eli
                    Lilly, for many years a society officer and member of the board of trustees.</p>
            <p>Gayle Thornbrough became executive secretary of the society in 1976, a few months before the death of
                    Eli Lilly and the public disclosure of the fact that he had left the society a substantial fortune,
                    10 percent of his holdings in Lilly stock. The gift reflected Lilly's confidence in the
                    institution of which Gayle Thornbrough had been such an important part for nearly forty years; since
                    1977 she has had the major leadership role in the transformation of a small historical society with
                    a distinguished publication program into the vanguard of the American historical society movement.
                    Since 1977 Thornbrough has led the society judiciously but swiftly into an impressive number of
                    innovative projects, working at every turn to expand the materials available for a full
                    understanding of Indiana and American history. Even a short list begins to suggest the range of the
                    Thornbrough-led society: supporting a new faculty position in the history of medicine at Indiana
                    University, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>; producing a bibliography of Indiana newspapers; undertaking a new guide to Indiana on
                    the lines of the old WPA guide; publishing an award-winning record album and booklet on Indiana
                    ragtime; awarding dissertation fellowships to support research in Indiana history; and adding staff
                    support to successful but underfunded state programs like the Geneaology Division of the Indiana
                    State Library and the outstanding Indiana Junior Historical Society.</p>
            <p>Gayle Thornbrough has led the society through a challenging period of expansion and reevaluation in
                    the wake of the Lilly gift. She has demonstrated a steady sense of the society's scholarly
                        <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-080-3-091"/> purpose along with a flexible response to new
                    opportunities. Her imprint on the new Indiana Historical Society has worked to insure that the old
                    values of excellence and integrity will prevail despite the excitement of dramatic new
                    opportunities.</p>
            <p>Gayle Thornbrough has been identified with the Indiana Historical Society so closely and for so long
                    that it is very difficult to imagine the institution without her. Her personal elegance and quiet
                    dignity set a tone of bracing gentility that made all her associates and friends stand up a little
                    straighter for the world, proud to be associated with her. Throughout her career Miss Thornbrough
                    has embodied the ideal of the lady—and the gentleman, for that matter—gentle,
                    diffident, honorable, and altogether capable. While the ideal has sometimes been set aside by
                    succeeding generations and other times transmogrified in an effort to fashion a
                    "postmodern" version, Thornbrough's personal example has reminded all who know her
                    of the sterling virtues of the older ideal.</p>
            <p>It was altogether fitting that Indiana University awarded Gayle Thornbrough an honorary doctor of
                    laws degree in 1983 in recognition of her distinguished career as a historian and an administrator.
                    But, by all who care about Indiana history, she will be honored for many generations to come.</p>

            <p>Interspersed among residential communities, industrial plants, and a state park, the Indiana Dunes
                    National Lakeshore resembles a crazy quilt. How such a national park came into existence is the
                    subject of this fascinating and informative account of efforts to "save the
                    dunes." With dramatic flair and a broad historical sweep, Kay <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Norma Schaeffer document the long, frustrating crusade against local entrepreneurs,
                    politicians, and corporate spokesmen who charged that "outsiders" wanted to retard
                    Indiana's progress and deplete its tax base in order to provide a playground for
                    Chicagoans. Their case study illuminates the detailed inner workings of governmental decision making
                    and policy implementation. Divided into two parts, "The Long War" and "Reluctant
                    Ally," the book provides both a historical overview and a critique of the National Park
                    Service.</p>
            <p>Formed more than ten thousand years ago, the Dunes of northwest Indiana spawned an amazing variety of
                    vegetation that provided pioneer ecologists with an ideal natural laboratory. Even so, local
                    boosters envisioned lakeshore industrial facilities in <placeName>

                    </placeName> first took up the preservationist cause; its "Saturday Afternoon Walks"
                    program led to the establishment of a campsite under the auspices of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Club. Failing to enlist enough political support in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, conservationists had to settle in 1923 for a small, underfunded state park. Meanwhile,
                    completion of Burns Ditch increased the clamor for developing a harbor for steelmakers. As business
                    groups courted support from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army Engineers, the Save the Dunes Council collected a half-million signatures,
                    launched a sophisticated lobbying and legal campaign, and convinced Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois
                    to introduce federal parks legislation. Nonetheless, they could not halt indefinitely construction
                    of the "Port of Indiana." Once the harbor was a reality, Indiana Democrats
                    supported legislation (in 1966, just before Douglas lost his Senate seat) for a scaled-down,
                    6,539-acre park, a preserve containing, according to <placeName>

                    the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore "consisted of noncontiguous bits and pieces that
                    promised management problems for the National Park Service and confusion for the park's
                    clientele" <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-080-3-093"/>

                    shifted toward ecology, and the market for American-made steel declined precipitously. In the past
                    fifteen years Dunes advocates have faced new controversies centering on park expansion, tourist
                    facilities, the threatened building of a nuclear power plant, and the reactionary policies of
                    Department of Interior Secretary James Watt.</p>
            <p>The authors' eight years of research yielded a harvest of information gleaned from sources
                    ranging from organizational files to oral interviews. Sometimes their generalizations are overdrawn,
                    as when they claim that "no one in Lake or Porter counties mourned the loss of the
                    progressive movement, which, in fact, had never reached the region in the first place" (p. 497).
                    Within each chapter, however, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Schaeffer offer lively capsule biographies and episodic vignettes. The
                    book's only major organizational failing is that the chronology sometimes seems fractured.
                    Chapter 3, for example, should more logically follow chapter 4. Otherwise, the account is thorough,
                    accurate, and fair-minded, avoiding pejorative judgments even against the likes of Congressman
                    Charles A. Halleck. A section listing important milestones would have been welcome, as would more
                    information on inholders and some commentary on the relationship between the Indiana Dunes State
                    Park and the National Lakeshore, which, the authors succintly conclude, "exist side by

                    reinforces the statement of Alfred A. Knopf: "You may frequently win a battle, but you can
                    never win the war. Whenever one threat is put down, another immediately arises: the struggle is
                    endless, and conservationists must always be ready to rally their forces for another fight. Even
                    triumphs carry their own dangers" (p. v).</p>

                    Southern Illinois University Press, 1983. Pp. xii, 322. Frontispiece, notes, selected bibliography,
                    index. $24.95.)</head>
            <p>Charles A. Beard has influenced Americans in ways that neither he nor his biographers could have
                    anticipated. Let me begin by citing a personal example. In the late 1950s, while I was a student at
                    a liberal arts college in a neighboring state, I found myself on an airplane going from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName> to my home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> following a pre-Christmas basketball tournament in that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ohio city</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Seated next to me was an elderly salesman from upstate <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> who, to make conversation as the plane prepared <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-080-3-095"/> to
                    take off, asked me what my major was. When I replied "history, at least for now,"
                    he proceeded to fill almost all of the time during our two-hour flight with the most amazing stories
                    of his "favorite historian," one "Charlie" Beard, who had written the
                    most wonderful books on the Constitution, Pearl Harbor, the New Deal, and America in general. Since
                    I was not quite half way through the standard sophomore year American history survey at that time, I
                    had to confess that I was not too familiar with Beard's work, but I left that flight
                    absolutely overwhelmed by the fact that a sixty-year-old salesman could discuss any
                    historian's work at such length and in so much detail. The Beardian influence is obvious
                    though it probably has little to do with the major issues of Beard's life as they are so
                    ably discussed by Ellen Nore in this excellent biography.</p>
            <p>Nore captures as much of Charles A. Beard's intellectual side as readers are likely to see
                    in print, at least until that time when some scholar decides to devote an entire academic career to
                    a definitive biography. Indeed, as the author points out in her preface, both Charles and Mary Beard
                    thought that people should write about them based on their published work. To insure that approach
                    Charles Beard destroyed most of his letters shortly before his death in 1948 and noted more than
                    once while he lived that he "did not really approve of biography" because "the
                    lives of individuals … left out too much" (p. xii). Although Nore feels that she has not
                    "really succeeded in calling Beard back in an immediate way," there does not seem
                    to be as much distance between author and subject as she thinks there is.</p>
            <p>From his early years growing up in east central Indiana and his undergraduate days at DePauw, Nore
                    follows Beard's remarkable career, in largely chronological fashion, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> universities and, following his resignation from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> school's faculty in 1917, to his thirty-year career as a "public
                    intellectual," a person whose scholarship was read and discussed far beyond the academic
                    community. At almost every important juncture in this amazing odyssey, Nore carefully analyzes the
                    people and the ideas which influenced Beard and, in turn, the manner in which Beard influenced those
                    around him. In fact, if one were to list the people, academic and nonacademic, who were
                    "significant others" for Charles Beard, the group would be a who-was-who during the years
                    from roughly 1850 to the end of World War II.</p>
            <p>As Nore is careful to note, few of the major political, social, and academic problems that America
                    faced in the first half of the twentieth century escaped Beard's searching inquiry. In fact
                    one difficulty that any of his biographers must face is how much attention <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-080-3-096"/> to devote to such topics as reform, war and peace, the university and
                    its relationship to the larger society, academic freedom, political and business leadership,
                    corporate responsibility, and national and regional planning. Nore meets this problem head on and
                    provides her readers with appropriate balance while, at the same time, going out of her way to give
                    Beard's critics equal time.</p>
            <p>Intellectual biography is probably the most difficult type of biography to write since it must focus
                    on life, times, and ideas and must strive to make some sense out of the interplay between all three
                    elements. When one adds to these obvious problems a life as complex as Charles Beard's, one
                    might conclude that there are easier paths to follow. Fortunately, Nore chooses the difficult way.
                    As a result she has researched and written a study that may serve as one kind of model in this
                    genre. In addition, her interpretation is an important addition to recent Beardian scholarship,
                    especially as it relates to the traditional "placement" of Beard as one third of the
                    intellectual trinity which includes V#2 L. Parrington and Frederick J. Turner. Perhaps she may now
                    wish to turn to an equally important subject who richly merits an intellectual biography, Robert
                    Lynd. In fact, Nore handles the relationship between Charles and Mary Beard so well that Robert and
                    Helen Lynd should present no problem whatsoever.</p>

                    Neal's spirited, engaging biography of the Hoosier-born, Wall Street executive who captured
                    the 1940 Republican nomination for president. As Neal describes him, Willkie was a maverick and free
                    spirit. Among his family in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elwood</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and as a student at Indiana University, he was a radical. In later years
                    Willkie reflected: "Any man who is not something of a Socialist before … forty
                    has no heart. Any man who is still a Socialist after … forty has no head" (p. 8). By age
                    forty-one Willkie was president of Commonwealth and Southern, a giant utility holding company.
                    Intellectual ability, a charismatic personality, and luck contributed to his business success and
                    led to his political rise.</p>

                    not-so-secret mistress, had never held elective office, and had to defeat such formidable Republican
                    regulars as Robert A. Taft and Thomas A. Dewey. Neal's writing and analysis are at their
                    best in recounting Willkie's triumph over these obstacles in one of the most improbable
                    candidacies in American history.</p>
            <p>The president of Commonwealth and Southern had fought an eight-year battle with the Tennessee Valley
                    Authority that, although ultimately unsuccessful, made him a folk hero among New Deal critics.
                    Still, Willkie would never have been able to snatch the nomination from Taft and Dewey without the
                    Nazi conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in June, 1940. Among the Republican candidates Willkie alone was an outspoken
                    internationalist, who warned that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had vital interests at stake in the European war. When the convention balloting began
                    on June 27, the Nazi victory had brought many Republicans to Willkie's position. With adept
                    convention strategy by Indiana Congressman Charles A. Halleck and others, the erstwhile Democrat won
                    the right to contest <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-080-3-098"/> Franklin D. Roosevelt. In November Willkie
                    carried his home state of Indiana and only nine others. Despite the lopsided electoral vote, the
                    popular vote was much closer.</p>

                    Willkie and occasionally lapses into some excesses. For example, he gives Willkie extravagant credit
                    for his role in the 1941 passage of the Lend-Lease Act and the 1943 termination of the unequal

            <p>That the life and accomplishments in aviation of Orin Moore Welch are not better known is lamentable
                    indeed. Welch was a self-educated aeronautical engineer and flier who in 1927 began constructing
                    airplanes of his own design in Anderson, Indiana. After four years of experimentation he began
                    production in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, of an inexpensive, reliable, and safe cabin monoplane that he hoped would
                    bring personal flying to the masses. The Welch Aircraft Company moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1936 and then to Wilkes-Barre, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1940. By the time production ceased on the eve of World War II, the family owned
                    and operated firm had delivered fifty of the diminutive planes, a considerable number of which were
                    powered by Welch designed and manufactured engines.</p>
            <p>Drina Welch Abel has written an admiring tribute to her older brother, who was declared missing and
                    presumed dead while flying a C-47 from Chungking to Calcutta in 1943. The book abounds with her
                    personal recollections, newspaper accounts, and information on nearly every Welch airplane. The
                    detailed drawings, photographs, specifications, and registration lists should prove a boon to
                    antique airplane buffs and scale modelers looking for something out of the ordinary.</p>
            <p>The book is, however, going to disappoint the specialist historian. It is amateurish in nearly every
                    respect. Abel has made no attempt to place her brother's career within the historical <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-080-3-099"/> context of aviation in the 1920s and
                    1930s—specifically, the concept of the "airplane for everyman," the
                    "Lindbergh boom," and advances in airfoil and engine technology. Basic questions
                    about the Welch company go unanswered. Where, for example, did Welch raise the capital for his firm?
                    Did his designs consciously follow those of such competitors in the light plane business as Aeronca
                    and Taylor Brothers? Why did the company move from Indiana to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>? In style, layout, and printing the book does not come up to expectations. The numerous
                    undated and unidentified newspaper clippings, typographical errors, and poorly reproduced
                    photographs lend a scrapbook character that could easily have been alleviated by more active and
                    skillful editing.</p>
            <p>As a contribution to an understanding of aviation in Indiana and to the history of technology, <hi rend="i">The Welch Airplane Story</hi> is severely deficient. As a loving gift to the memory of
                    a brother who died too young, it is a lasting personal testimonial.</p>

            <p>Denying that pre-Civil War politics was shaped significantly by ethnocultural issues, Stephen E.
                    Maizlish argues in this study of Ohio politics that sectionalism was indeed responsible for the
                    breakup of the second party system. Economic issues, Maizlish argues, brought about the formation of
                    political parties in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, but as the Democrats' economic views (notably on banks) proved impractical in
                    an economically maturing state in need of credit sources, their party factionalized along hard
                    money/soft money lines, causing a once unifying issue to became divisive. As party cohesion
                    declined, sectional issues that touched on important concerns for Ohioans, such as free labor and
                    the fear of southern <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-080-3-101"/> domination, became important. From 1844,
                    when the Texas annexation issue dominated the presidential campaign, sectionalism shaped politics.
                    By 1848–1849, when Democrats joined the Free Soilers to repeal <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s Black Laws and elect Salmon P. Chase to the Senate, ideological consistency
                    with the past had vanished. The Compromise of 1850 led to voter disgust and apathy, not the
                    diminution of sectional feeling. Apparent voter interest in nativism and temperance resulted from
                    the political vacuum created by party decline. Such issues were too divisive to be significant in
                    the formation of new coalitions. What differentiated the newly emergent political organizations was
                    their orientation to the coming sectional conflict.</p>
            <p>Maizlish's methodology as well as his interpretation is traditional. He relies heavily on
                    the correspondence of state and national politicians supplemented by newspapers from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s major cities. Although he provides in an appendix an ecological regression
                    analysis (actually prepared by William Gienapp) of the transition in voter support for different
                    parties between 1848 and 1856, it plays a minor role in his analysis. Ethnoculturalists will
                    probably not be persuaded by such evidence. Many of Maizlish's quotations, one might argue,
                    could be equally well interpreted as showing the continued strength, not weakness, of political
                    party identifications in the face of emerging sectional issues. And, in the absence of a systematic
                    analysis of the power structure in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, it is difficult to judge what weight to give to the opinions expressed. If voters
                    imposed their priorities upon politicians, as Maizlish suggests, one must examine actual voter
                    shifts and not depend on the random and sometimes contradictory comments of politicians concerning
                    public opinion. Maizlish is too ready to build an analysis upon assertion, such as his claim that
                    the continued debate over banking in 1850 (long after he argues it had become irrelevant) was a sign
                    of "ritualistic gestures of respect for the doctrines of a bygone era" (p. 164). One feels
                    that Maizlish appreciates the aspirations of those who wanted to war against the obscenity of
                    slavery but that he has chosen an approach that assumes, rather than convincingly proves, that
                    slavery actually shaped political reality in <placeName>

            <p>Until recently very little scholarship has addressed the involvement of blacks in the development of
                    the American frontier. <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-080-3-102"/> Juliet E.K. Walker's biography
                    is about a "relatively obscure historical figure," Free Frank—a black
                    pioneer—and his experiences on the tran-Appalachian frontier (p. 5). Even though the life
                    of Free Frank is the primary subject of the book, Walker argues convincingly that African-American
                    "economic activities, where they existed on the nation's antebellum frontier,
                    contributed to the transformation of the wilderness areas into established communities" (p. 2).</p>
            <p>Born a slave in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> piedmont in 1777, Frank [McWorter] died a free man in 1854 in a town he had founded in
                    western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. In 1795 Free Frank's owner moved to the Pennyroyal region of Kentucky in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pulaski County</region>
                    </placeName>. Four years later Frank married Lucy, a slave on a neighboring farm. Like many pioneer
                    slaves, Free Frank learned a number of highly marketable skills that would prove to be invaluably
                    beneficial in both his and his family's quest for freedom. When his owner moved once again
                    to Tennessee in the early years of the nineteenth century, Free Frank was left in charge of the
                    farm. In addition to his farm responsibilities, he established a saltpeter operation during the War
                    of 1812, an enterprise that he maintained until he left <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Because Free Frank's activities during the 1800s are well documented, Walker
                    is able to reconstruct the events of this black man's extraordinary life by using oral
                    history interviews, family papers, public documents, and secondary sources. The secondary literature
                    that she consulted is her main source when describing conditions experienced by blacks on the
                    antebellum frontier.</p>
            <p>In 1817, with money saved from commercial endeavors, Frank achieved what was of paramount
                    concern—the purchase of his wife's freedom for eight hundred dollars; two years
                    later he bought his own liberty for the same price. Frank's diverse business activities
                    were always motivated by a strong desire to buy his family's freedom. Over a period of
                    forty years he purchased sixteen family members from slavery.</p>
            <p>Because Free Frank was also involved as a litigant in several court cases, the book adds much to an
                    understanding of the legal practices, as well as the business activities, of the antebellum
                    frontier. The book also reveals much about white settlers' attitudes toward blacks. The
                    author notes that even though "racism was just as pervasive on the new frontier" (p. 91) as
                    it was in the South there were some whites who did interact with blacks. Thus, New

            <p>This exemplary volume appraises a seriously overlooked but important chapter in American
                    history—the contributions made by African-Americans in developing the nation's
                    antebellum frontier. Those especially interested in black history and frontier history will find
                    Free Frank a useful addition to their collection.</p>

            <p>The collective experiences found in the countless extant Civil War letters and diaries continue to be
                    an invaluable source for understanding that great conflict. Over the years many of these documents
                    have found their way into print. The Civil War letters of Henry A. Kircher, edited by Earl J. Hess,
                    are a welcome addition to this genre in that they present a view of the war through the eyes of an

                    </placeName> friends first joined the 9th Illinois as three-months recruits, but he quickly became
                    disillusioned by the political infighting that he visualized would be a barrier to his advancement
                    in the regiment. Because of this disillusionment and the antagonism that developed between the
                    Germans and Americans, he and his Belleville neighbors decided to cross the Mississippi and join the
                    newly formed 12th <placeName>

                    Missouri took part in several important campaigns during their three years service, including Pea

                    </placeName>, and finally Lookout Mountain. Kircher's letters, most of them written to his
                    mother, end abruptly in November, 1863, following the battle of Ringgold, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, where he received wounds that caused him to lose both an arm and a leg. Following the

                    two terms as mayor. Kircher was married in 1880 to Bertha Engelmann and had three children. He died
                    on May 1, 1908.</p>
            <p>The sixty-four letters reproduced in the book, transcribed from the old <placeName>

                    serve his fatherland. In doing so he comes of age through the rigors of the battles and the boredom
                    that challenge him during his thirty-one months of campaigning in the war's western
                    theater. Although the letters add little new information to an understanding of the daily life of
                    the Civil War soldier (except perhaps for the period in late 1862 and early 1863 when the regiment
                    served as sharpshooters on Union gunboats during the Yazoo Pass Expedition), as source material they
                    do touch on a historically neglected view of the ethnic soldier in the Union army.
                    "Contrary to popular belief concerning the war as a melting pot, Kircher's letters
                    help suggest that a sense of separateness remained strong throughout the conflict" (Preface). This
                    latter point is the basic theme of the Hess publication.</p>
            <p>Information found in Kircher's diaries helps fill out the gaps in the letters and provides
                    the needed source material for Hess's narrative that serves as a link between each letter.
                    The book is well annotated and contains photographs, maps, and a bibliographical essay. All in all
                    it will be a fine addition to any Civil War library.</p>

            <p>This valuable book rests on prodigious research in obscure sources to give a comprehensive view of
                    the saloon in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Perry R. Duis mined local newspapers, scattered manuscript sources, and little-known
                    trade publications produced by branches of the liquor industries. The two cities had very different
                    regulatory policies. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was wide open, with ubiquitous saloons, once reaching a ratio of about one saloon for
                    each 150 persons. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> used its licensing powers to limit the number of saloons and restricted them to the
                    city's hub. The result was a different pattern within a common theme.</p>
            <p>The author explains the saloon as a semipublic institution in urban milieus that were increasingly
                    becoming privatized. Saloons were private businesses, sometimes small and sometimes, <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-080-3-105"/> in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, outlets for vertically integrated brewers, which welcomed the public. Saloon customers
                    obtained refuge from the public spaces of the city, there to take comfort, quench thirsts, slake
                    palates, and socialize. As wealth increased, however, Americans sought private
                    spaces—clubs, apartment hotels, suburban homes, and automobiles—for their
                    routine activities, and the semipublic saloon declined, its fate sealed finally by national
                    prohibition in 1919.</p>
            <p>This reviewer finds little fault with Duis's research and his view of space in the evolving
                    city; but the author has not carefully evaluated all his sources, and he misunderstands the recent
                    interpretation of the prohibition movement. Duis observes that the reformers who would outlaw the
                    manufacture and sale of liquor were reacting in a way "that had little to do with the
                    evolution of the liquor industry or drinking patterns" (p. 2). But <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> Clark and others have shown that the popularity of prohibition grew in response to a
                    growing rate of alcohol consumption even as beer was replacing spirits in the marketplace.
                    Today's rates of consumption, slightly higher than those of Duis's period, elicit
                    widespread concerns about alcohol misuse; the earlier pattern of consumption elicited prohibition.
                    Thus the author misunderstands the dynamics of the saloon, drinking, and reform responses before
                    World War I. To compound the error, Duis sometimes too uncritically accepts evidence and arguments
                    generated by the liquor industries. Self-serving liquor papers, for instance, do not convince this
                    reader that "respectable" women slipped from husbands' watchful eyes to obtain
                    drink in pharmacies and soda fountains (p. 223).</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Duis advances knowledge of the social history of alcohol. His work promotes a better
                    understanding of the liquor industries, the types of customers and problems encountered, and the
                    varieties of ways in which Americans have used alcohol and responded to its misuse.</p>

            <p>Since Harry M. Caudill published <hi rend="i">Night Comes to the Cumberlands</hi> a generation ago,
                    he has not wavered in his indictment of both the corporations that have pillaged his Appalachian
                    homeland and the governments—local, state, and national—that have compounded
                    the problems of the region. In the intervening years <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-080-3-106"/> he has
                    contributed numerous articles to the liberal eastern press, written several books, including
                    fiction, and spoken before audiences across the world.</p>
            <p>As is true of most of Caudill's work, some controversy surrounds publication of this book.
                    When the University Press of Kentucky refused to print it, citing a lack of documentation, the
                    University of Illinois Press jumped at the chance to expand their Appalachian studies offerings.
                    Purists of the historian's craft will find the last chapter, as well as much of the
                    remainder of the book, resting on too thin exposition. However, in Caudill's defense it
                    should be remembered that he is first a lawyer and advocate of his region and secondarily a
                    historian.</p>
            <p>In only 164 pages of text Caudill describes the development of "colonialism" in his beloved
                    eastern Kentucky by the "moguls," who represented either the wealth of the British
                    Isles or that of the northeastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The not-so-famous plunderers included the Scottish-born Alexander Alan Arthur and
                    native Kentuckian John C. C. Mayo. If Arthur could not fulfill his dream of molding Middlesborough
                    into another <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mayo's legacy, the broad-form deed, continues to bedevil Kentucky land and
                    mineral policies. Of course, the better-known Belmonts, Rockefellers, and a host of other easterners
                    presided over the dividing of the land from their corporate board rooms. As one would expect,
                    Caudill accuses several generations of Kentucky politicians of being henchmen of the mining and
                    railroad interests. Readers are told that F#2 D. Roosevelt (a traditional hero to liberals) as a
                    young lawyer played a role in the gathering of land for his uncle. More ironically, two of the most
                    liberal of eastern universities, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, presently hold nearly ten thousand acres of prime Kentucky coal land.</p>
            <p>The author maintains that his is the first book to expose the moguls. It is in the last chapter,
                    "The Modern Moguls," that he strays over the line separating history from
                    polemics, a trend not unusual in today's historical writing. Here his evidence is mostly
                    circumstantial, and he is not averse to laying blame on several prominent Kentucky politicians and
                    corporations. "Eastern Kentucky is a colony owned and managed by absentee
                    landlords," Caudill concludes (p. 151). The boom and bust cycle that has dominated the coal
                    industry offers no promise of a rosy future. "The region's doom is virtually
                    sealed: the insatiable global demands for fuel and chemicals have already determined that" (p. 164).</p>
            <p>The merit of this book ultimately resides in the hands of each reader. Anyone interested in the past,
                    present, or future of Appalachia should read <hi rend="i">Theirs Be the Power.</hi>

            <p>In an excellent example of revisionism Professor Kendrick A. Clements has made an important
                    contribution with this book on William Jennings Bryan and foreign policy. Bryan scholars and
                    diplomatic historians will find much of use. Arguing that Bryan's foreign policy record
                    deserves additional study, the author notes that "Bryan's attitudes mirrored those
                    of millions of Americans … as they faced an increasingly unstable and dangerous world"
                    (p. i). Bryan combined an evangelical sense of Christian—and American—mission
                    with a practical idealism that sometimes remained in harmony and sometimes conflicted. As an
                    evangelical Christian and highly ethnocentric American, Bryan believed in America's
                    obligation to "moralize" the world, thus causing him reluctantly to support annexation of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="ph">Philippines</country>
                    </placeName> and intervention in Latin America. Yet he also evidenced ability to compromise, work
                    with potential foes and allies, and view realistically a world hurrying to war.</p>
            <p>Clements's contribution is enhanced by excellent research and good writing. Certainly the
                    author was exhaustive with his research, and he employs a lively and interesting style. Photographs
                    and charts are a useful addition. There are, however, some minor flaws. Clements overlooks the 1908
                    election while mentioning those before and after. He excuses Bryan's lack of concern with
                    or knowledge of economic imperialism. He may be too lenient with Bryan over relations with <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>, and, lastly, he may be too forgiving of Bryan's stewardship of the State
                    Department, his staffing the Foreign Service with "deserving" Democrats, and his role in
                    the Sullivan scandal. Perhaps, in performing a useful and necessary revision of Bryan and foreign
                    policy, Clements slightly overstates his case; nonetheless, this book is necessary reading for
                    scholars of the period.</p>

            <p>Although Donald J. Mrozek is a historian with a number of sport history contributions to his credit,
                    readers who are looking for a general history of sport in his new book, <hi rend="i">Sport and
                        American <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-080-3-108"/> Mentality,</hi> will be disappointed. The focus of
                    the text is not on the evolution of sport but, rather, on the analysis of the meaning and
                    significance of sport in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the decades at the turn of the century. Mrozek's selection of the time
                    period for study is, in itself, significant. "Sport remained complex and confusing
                    …," he notes, "but it enjoyed a generally higher moral tone
                    … because of a new interpretation of its utility to society" (p. xiv).</p>
            <p>Chapter headings suggest the essence of the "new interpretation."
                    "Strategies of Regeneration" considers sport in relation to renewal, physical as well as
                    spiritual, suggesting, even, that sport offered a "means to fulfill … the needs
                    that religion had difficulty in meeting" (p. 4). In "Social Efficiency and the Spirit of
                    Victory" the attitudes and ideas about sport held by political leaders such as Theodore Roosevelt
                    and military officers such as Leonard Wood are explored. "Winning and the Regulated Life"
                    speaks to Americans' insatiable interest in sport, the approaches developed to ensure
                    winning teams, and the differing view of sport as espoused by physical educators, coaches, and
                    trainers. The influence of the ultra rich on sporting attitudes is explored in "Sporting
                    Life as Consumption, Fashion, and Display," and chapter five, "From
                    ‘Swooning Damsel’ to Sportswoman," examines the role of sport in
                    women's quest for emancipation as well as the "reciprocal impact that women had on
                    sport" (p. 136). The chapter, "From Playing Fields to National Parks," is perhaps
                    one of Mrozek's best as he attempts to analyze sport in relation to a developing concern
                    for and interest in American nationalism. The increasing interest in sport as a means of achieving
                    health is examined in a chapter aptly titled "Toward a New Image of the Body."</p>
            <p>In spite of Mrozek's "wizardry with words" (one suspects at times that he has even
                    coined new words), he has accomplished a task that few authors on the topic of sport have attempted;
                    that is, an effort to analyze the meaning and significance of sport in the lives of Americans. While
                    he does consider the role of women in his analysis, the role of blacks is conspicuously absent from
                    the treatise. As he noted with regard to another topic, however, that may be another story. And,
                    while one may or may not agree with his conclusions about sport and American mentality, he must be
                    given credit for examining sport in American life from a different perspective during one short time
                    period. As Mrozek concludes, "The complex and sometimes countervailing forces within sport
                    militate against explanation. Yet … they suggest the importance of sport as a part of the
                    ongoing cultural development of America" (p. 234). His efforts to provide insight into the sport
                    phenomenon as a part of that culture are commendable.</p>

            <p>In recent years the familiar genre of autobiography has merged with the subject of family history and
                    the technique of oral history to produce such notable books as Alex Haley's Roots (1976)
                    and Theodore Rosengarten's <hi rend="i">All God's Dangers</hi> (1974). Joining

                    centenarian Burnam Ledford and his wife Addie of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. During
                    the next six years he probed and reconstructed seven generations of this "quintessentially
                    American" family (p. 4). He studied courthouse records and cemetery gravestones. He explored various
                    family sites. Most of all he talked and listened. Burnam and Addie narrated extensive oral histories
                    of their seventy-five-year marriage, their forebears, and their progeny. One hundred hours of
                    recorded interviews enabled Egerton to prepare a family biography spanning the national history of
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>To epitomize mainstream America with one family is an effective literary device but a preposterous
                    gesture of population sampling. Egerton actually offers not so much a microscopic glimpse of all
                    America as a prismatic view of one layer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Generations</hi> contains some remarkable insights and revelations. There is the
                    familiar theme of continuity and change. There also are the centrifugal and centripetal forces
                    operating on successive generations. Dispersing the family socially and geographically are such
                    influences as marriage and career mobility. Drawing them together are such equally powerful magnets
                    as their Kentucky homestead, the state university, and family reunions. Literally and figuratively
                    at center stage in this family drama are Burnam and Addie. Their memories and sense of history
                    bridge the distant past and the present. Born in 1876, Burnam could reflect sadly on the death of
                    President John F. Kennedy by personally recalling the assassinations not only of William McKinley
                    but even of James A. Garfield. Burnam's memory proved remarkably consistent, detailed, and
                    accurate, making him a reliable oral chronicler of his time.</p>
            <p>Burnam Ledford carried a century of historical experience in his head. His death in 1983 obliterated
                    that personal link with a deep and distinctive slice of the American past. Thanks to
                    Egerton's <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-080-3-110"/> luck in finding the Ledfords, perseverance
                    in studying them, and skill in narrating their seven-generation story, readers have an absorbing and
                    illuminating family history.</p>

                    $29.95.)</head>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Their Number Become Thinned</hi> Henry F. Dobyns attempts to identify the
                    "major dynamics of population trends" for native North America and to analyze, as an
                    "illustrative" example, the demographic history of the Timucuan chiefdoms of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> (p. 4). Dobyns's theme is the depopulation of native North America by exotic
                    diseases to which Indian peoples had no immunity. His account of the impact of these epidemics is
                    not only lucid it is also suggestive in its examination of the relationship between demographic and
                    social change.</p>
            <p>The meat of this book, however, and the part sure to inspire controversy, is Dobyns's
                    attempt to establish the original size of the populations these diseases ravaged. He initially
                    calculates a figure of eighteen million people for the North American continent, but his most
                    original work is done in the case study of the Timucuans. Dobyns proceeds methodically. First he
                    assesses the carrying capacity of the land at a given level of technology. He then turns to
                    estimates made by Europeans of warrior strength, village size, and the number of people living in
                    each house. On the basis of his data he makes several estimates of population in the mid-sixteenth
                    century. Finally, Dobyns determines what epidemics had already swept over the Timucuans by this date
                    and uses the death rates such epidemics had inflicted elsewhere to calculate backwards to
                    pre-epidemic populations. He suggests that 722,000 people lived in the Timucuan chiefdoms in 1517.
                    The highest current estimate is 20,000. Such figures suggest the boldness of Dobyns's
                    revisionism.</p>
            <p>This book is a major work of scholarship, one that is both methodical and ingenious, but its large
                    conclusions often flow from sparse evidence. To share Dobyns's conclusions readers will
                    have to share his assumptions. Dobyns, for instance, works from the basic Malthusian premise of
                    cultural materialism: population <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-080-3-111"/> will inevitably increase to
                    the limits of subsistence. Not all scholars would agree that this has been demonstrated, nor will
                    all be convinced by more specific uses of evidence. Paintings of dubious ethnographic validity and
                    estimates of field size by passing Spanish marauders are translated into caloric yields from hunting
                    and agriculture. A rough numerical parity between chiefdoms and between villages within chiefdoms is
                    assumed so that one estimate of warrior strength or village size is applied to other groups for whom
                    no data exist. Here Dobyns is struggling with lack of evidence, but in his discussion of soil
                    fertility and Indian agriculture he often proceeds with little reference to available scientific
                    research. Finally, in his calculations he sometimes writes as if epidemics produced identical death
                    rates regardless of social conditions. These and similar issues will almost certainly make this book
                    the center of a fruitful and significant scholarly controversy.</p>

                    </placeName>: Icarus Press, 1982. Pp. xi, 333. Illustrations, charts, appendixes, index. Clothbound,
                    $18.85; paperbound, $13.60.) One of Indiana's veteran sportswriters
                    has attempted in this book to portray the excitement and tradition of Indiana high school boys
                    basketball. The book has four sections, dealing with the perennial contenders, the stars, the
                    coaches, and the "Cinderella" teams. Williams recounts the major stories: from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "Wonder Five" of the early 1920s, through the Crispus Attucks years
                    of Oscar Robertson, to the recent past of George McGinnis and Larry Bird. There is, of course, a
                    chapter devoted to the Milan "Miracle" of 1954, perhaps the most enduring and oft-told tale
                    in all of Indiana basketball. Enthusiasts will be reminded of events and players they once saw or
                    read about. In this and other ways Williams's book is entertaining and useful, but it is
                    not the full history of Indiana basketball that so needs to be written, the history that will set
                    the sport in the full context of twentieth-century social change and continuity. <hi rend="i">James

                    to Indiana prehistory first published in 1973. The new edition updates the contents to take into
                    account continuing work in the field. In addition to a general overview of Indiana archaeology and
                    prehistory, James H. Kellar provides several appendixes and a bibliography that will help those

                    the material accessible. Here the reader can begin to understand some of the richness of the
                    American Indian past and perhaps also develop a sense of the importance of the physical remains of
