                    successor to FDR, until the president decided to run for a third term in 1940.
                    He then sought the Democratic nomination for vice president, until Roosevelt
                    declared his preference for Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace. A
                    possible candidate for president and a viable candidate for vice president,

                    veterans&apos; politics in general, and the American Legion in particular, that
                    launched McNutt&apos;s political career. He won election as commander of the

                    service, anti-pacifism and anti-communism, a strong national defense, and
                    benefits for veterans coincided with those of McNutt, who became one of the most
                    charismatic figures in the organization over its first two decades.</p>
                <p>The topic of McNutt and the American Legion is significant in two respects. In a
                    narrow, biographical sense, McNutt&apos;s rise in the organization exemplified
                    much of his life&apos;s pattern. He succeeded at winning offices in the Legion,
                    and that raised his confidence and fueled his ambition-his most commented-on
                    character trait. He also labored hard to promote the Legion&apos;s agenda. And
                    yet, McNutt advanced beyond the organization, into the realm of electoral
                    politics. Through the Legion, he learned how to express his intentions, mobilize
                    supporters, plot strategy, and prevail at conventions. At the same time, in a
                    much larger historical sense, McNutt&apos;s experience in the Legion allows one
                    to examine the internal politics, ideology, and early years of the best known
                    veterans&apos; organization to emerge in the <placeName><country
                            key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U. S.</country></placeName>
                    following the Great War.</p>
                <p>Involvement in the Legion proved, for McNutt, a generally positive experience.
                    Joining the organization satisfied a range of personal needs, including an
                    ideological one. McNutt&apos;s experiences reinforced his realistic views on
                    foreign and defense policy, and may have encouraged his later embrace of the
                    welfare state. Moreover, the Legion, because of its youth, organizational
                    structure, and revolving-door leadership, became a road to distinction and later
                    on to a political career. McNutt&apos;s rise in the outfit made him a state and
                    national figure just as the Grand Old Party (GOP) was beginning to decline
                    politically in both <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"

                    </placeName> The Legion played a vital role in McNutt&apos;s election as
                    governor of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName> in 1932. Yet such successes also fed
                    McNutt&apos;s belief that, having advanced swiftly in the field of
                    veterans&apos; politics, he could do likewise in national, elected office. That
                    did not happen.</p>

                        which he graduated with a B.A. in English in 1913. Thereafter, Paul, like
                        many ambitious midwestern youths, headed east; he enrolled in Harvard Law

                        little interest in the military, his family possessed a tradition of
                        service: his maternal (and favorite) grandfather, Jacob M. Neely, had fought

                    <p>As an institution, the American Legion managed to look backward, sideways,
                        and ahead all at the same time. Veterans&apos; organizations had deep roots
                        in American history. The Legion, like the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR),
                        which had been formed by Union soldiers following the Civil War, strove to
                        maintain and to promote bonds between its members. Social functions cemented
                        Legionnaires together; despite the advent of Prohibition, alcohol flowed at
                        local, state, and national meetings.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> In the long run,
                        the culture of the Legion, with its mixture of spirits, revelry, and high
                        jinks, steeled by war stories and masculine bravado, enabled men of middle
                        age to revisit their youth and to escape &quot;the routine of everyday work
                        and the constraints of community life.&quot;<hi rend="sup">18</hi> In the
                        short run, the organization was, as an early observer writing in a southern
                        dialect noted, &quot;a young man yit.&quot; In other words, it was populated
                        by youthful veterans who mirrored the temper and aims of the newly founded
                        Legion itself-&quot;a good, game scrapper, ready to fight for a cause he
                        considers just.&quot;<hi rend="sup">19</hi></p>
                    <p>A principal cause of the American Legion, as it had been for the GAR, was to
                        secure benefits for veterans.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> In this area, the
                        Legion&apos;s greatest victory came in 1924 when, over the objections of
                        business leaders who feared inflation, and over the veto of President Calvin
                        Coolidge who was determined to balance the federal budget, Congress passed a
                        bonus for those who had served in World War I. The bonus was really a life
                        insurance policy to be paid to the heirs of each veteran upon his death, or
                        to the veteran after twenty years. Although the bonus did not foreshadow the
                        social concern and federal activism of the New Deal, it did signal a major
                        financial commitment by Congress to a specific group during a period of
                        conservative governance.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> It also underscored the
                        Legion&apos;s belief in the power of lobbying and collective action by its
                            members.<hi rend="sup">22</hi></p>

                    <p>The Legion ventured beyond the issue of veterans&apos; benefits when it
                        campaigned for &quot;100 percent Americanism.&quot;<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                        This effort operated at three levels. First, the Legion strove
                        &quot;&apos;to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the community,
                        state and nation.&apos;&quot; It did so by promoting public remembrance of
                        patriotic sacrifice.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Second, the Legion sought to
                        protect the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">
                                United States</country></placeName> from external enemies through a
                        program of military preparedness. Lastly, the organization wanted to
                        safeguard <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                                >America</country></placeName> &quot;from foes within.&quot;<hi
                            rend="sup">25</hi> To assure the loyalty of the next generation, the
                        Legion favored displaying the Stars and Stripes on all school grounds,
                        teaching upbeat interpretations of American history-not fault-finding
                        revisionism-and offering military training in high schools and colleges.
                        Overall, the American Legion pledged fealty to &quot;God and Country&quot;
                        and to defend the Constitution of the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"

                    <p>The Legion was unable to speak of American ideals without citing the need to
                        defend them. In the shadow of the Russian Revolution, strikes at home, and
                        the Red Scare of 1919-1920 (when the U. S. attorney general deported alien
                        radicals), the Legion attempted to silence the views of people whom it
                        deemed subversive or un-American.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> The organization was
                        not opposed to freedom of speech, just &quot;un-American free speech.&quot;
                        As Theodore Roosevelt Jr. phrased it, free speech &quot;simply means free
                        speech within given bounds.&quot;<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Communists emerged
                        as special targets for the Legion, as did pacifists, who rejected both
                        preparedness and military education. Of the two groups, pacifists enjoyed
                        far greater popular sympathy. In the aftermath of World War I, many
                        Americans, disillusioned that their nation had not achieved its wartime aims
                        to promote democracy and a lasting peace, turned toward isolationism and
                        against war.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> The Legion tried to counter such thinking
                        by memorializing its members&apos; past service and by attacking

                    <p>The American Legion also became a venue for veterans to distinguish
                        themselves and to be active politically. To be sure, the Legion&apos;s
                        constitution defined the organization as &quot;absolutely
                        non-political,&quot; and it forbade local posts from endorsing candidates
                        for elected office. Nevertheless, individual members saw nothing wrong with
                        engaging in partisan activities. In 1920, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and a few

                        MacNider, a former national commander of the Legion, formed the Republican
                        Service League to mobilize veterans to elect Coolidge. And the list of
                        national commanders who attained high office was long. It included the
                        junior Roosevelt, who was assistant secretary of the navy under President
                        Warren G. Harding and who ran unsuccessfully for governor of

                        anything, even greater. Perhaps for that reason, National Commander O. L.
                        Bodenhamer found himself warning, in 1930: &quot;Probably the most serious
                        offense an American Legion post, department, or national official can commit
                        against his organization is to use his office in the Legion for partisan

                    <p>McNutt, for his part, became attracted to the American Legion for several
                        reasons. During World War I, Paul had longed to see combat overseas and
                        lamented that the war ended before he got the chance to go &quot;over
                        there.&quot; After the war, he kept up his soldiery ties by accepting a
                        commission in the field artillery branch of the Officers Reserve Corps,
                        where he rose to the rank of colonel. He also entered the Reserve Officers
                        Association and even led the organization&apos;s <placeName><region

                        McNutt became a Legionnaire because he was a joiner. A profile, published in

                        having watched his father run for local and state offices with little
                        success. Moreover, both the elder and younger McNutt were ardent Democrats
                        in a Republican state during a period of GOP dominance. For Paul, a
                        political career was hardly inevitable. And yet, he had long been interested
                        in electoral contests dating back to his undergraduate days at IU.<hi
                            rend="sup">39</hi> In the 1920s, the Indiana Legion emerged as a
                        bailiwick for young Democrats and Republicans who, shut out of leadership by
                        more senior members of the parties, used the organization as a
                        &quot;training ground and springboard&quot; into public office.<hi

                        learning the ethics and primary purpose of politics,&quot; Harold C.
                        Feightner, a longtime Hoosier journalist, later explained. &quot;There
                        [were] quite a few fellows who learned their Ps and Qs through the American
                            Legion.&quot;<hi rend="sup">41</hi></p>
                    <p>For McNutt, the Legion was at first a refuge, and only later a launching pad
                        to statewide office. He joined the organization following World War I, when
                        his future was unsettled. In the early 1920s, McNutt began to socialize with
                        Legionnaires over card games, as he grew restless with his life as a law
                            professor.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Then, as McNutt clarified his
                        professional goals and decided to be something more than a faculty
                        member-securing the deanship of IU&apos;s law school in 1925-he showed
                        greater interest in the Legion. Like many Hoosier veterans, McNutt thought
                        that the local post was &quot;a place to be active.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                            >43</hi> Only later on, during 1927 and 1928, did he consider running

                        interestingly, he was deeply involved in the politics of the American

                    <p>Ideals as well as ambition fed McNutt&apos;s interest in the Legion. He
                        shared the Legion&apos;s core values, especially concerning patriotic
                        service. Regarding the Officers Reserve Corps, of which McNutt was a member,
                        he wrote: &quot;I want to see it live and prosper and I intend to do
                        everything in my power to help.&quot; He saw military service as a patriotic
                        duty and exhorted IU students to join the reserves.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
                        Consistent with the national mood, however, young people seemed
                        uninterested. Early in 1926, a debate erupted at IU over military training
                        through the school&apos;s Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC). Some
                        students asserted that this training ought to be made voluntary, while
                        others wanted it to remain mandatory.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Those favoring
                        change drew inspiration from Frederick J. Libby, a well-known pacifist
                        leader, who was on a speaking tour that included stops in <placeName><region

                        around 600 students petitioned to retain compulsory military training. Their
                        chief supporter was William Lowe Bryan, the university&apos;s president.<hi
                            rend="sup">48</hi></p>
                    <p>The debate escalated in March 1926, after Libby addressed an IU convocation.
                        Bryan did not attend the event, and neither did McNutt.<hi rend="sup"
                            >49</hi> In a speech a few days afterward, McNutt registered his
                        disapproval of pacifism, Libby-style. He reiterated that it was the
                        &quot;duty of every American citizen to serve this nation in time of

                        commander of the Indiana Legion. The state commander was elected to a
                        one-year term in much the same way that political parties selected nominees.

                        campaign, McNutt sounded like a U. S. politician of the previous century,
                        bashful about seeking office and insistent that friends were pushing his
                        candidacy. &quot;I have been strongly urged to become a candidate for State
                        Commander of the American Legion,&quot; McNutt told one associate. &quot;I
                        have no intention of entering any general scramble for the place because I
                        feel that, at this stage of the Legion&apos;s development the office should
                        seek the man rather than the man the office.&quot; Then he added: &quot;I am
                        willing to serve if the members of the Legion want me.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                        Indiana convened, McNutt was encouraging friends to canvass on his

                        McNutt also prepared well for the convention, and his local post nominated
                        him for state commander.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> Such happenings, combined

                        remove some of the stigma of his party affiliation. On their advice, McNutt
                        addressed as many district caucuses as possible, even on short notice. Such

                        and the Legion used the same slogan-&quot;100 percent Americanism&quot;-and
                        shared other similarities, including followings in the Midwest and
                        memberships that included professionals, merchants, and farmers. Around
                        300,000 Hoosiers joined the Klan in the 1920s.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
                        According to some Indiana Legionnaires, between twenty and fifty percent of
                        their compatriots were Klansmen.<hi rend="sup">82</hi> Both organizations
                        were avowedly patriotic, anti-radical, and unfriendly to immigration. The
                        Klan attacked immigrants as well as Catholics, Jews, and African
                            Americans.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> The Legion, for its part, lobbied

                        underscored other differences between the two organizations. The Klan
                        asserted that white, native-born Protestants were the only loyal and true
                        Americans. The Legion, in contrast, accepted into its ranks Jews, Catholics,
                        and foreign-born citizens, as long as they had participated in the Great
                        War. It also accepted African Americans, but confined them to segregated
                        posts. In sum, military service and adherence to the nation&apos;s founding
                        principles and its constitution defined the Legion&apos;s
                        &quot;Americanism.&quot;</p>

                    <p>If McNutt was good for the Indiana Legion, the Indiana Legion was also good
                        for McNutt in three respects. First, his leadership position in the
                        organization allowed him to travel to distant places. Late in 1927, McNutt
                        ventured beyond the American heartland when he and his wife, Kathleen,
                        attended the Legion&apos;s convention in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                            key="tgn_7008038" reg="Paris">Paris</settlement>
                        </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">97</hi> Second, the office of state commander
                        kept McNutt out of party politics, at least for a spell. After his election,
                        McNutt brushed aside pressure from Indiana Democrats to campaign for the
                        party&apos;s candidates in 1926.<hi rend="sup">98</hi> McNutt resolved that
                        &quot;any partisan speeches&quot; would have &quot;an unfortunate
                        reaction&quot; by turning wavering Legionnaires &quot;against our
                            candidates.&quot;<hi rend="sup">99</hi></p>
                    <p>Lastly, the Indiana Legion provided McNutt with political contacts, and none
                        proved more precious than that of Frank M. McHale. At the time of
                        McHale&apos;s death, in 1975, Democrats and Republicans alike lionized him
                        as a giant in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                        an American Legion post in Cass County, and rose in the Legion&apos;s
                        Indiana Department, serving on its legislative committee from 1919 to
                            1929.<hi rend="sup">101</hi> McHale&apos;s name became linked to
                        McNutt&apos;s star during their years in the Indiana Legion. McNutt
                        solicited his support in his campaign to be state commander.<hi rend="sup"
                            >102</hi> Although in that contest McHale supported O&apos;Shaughnessy,

                        blessing, elected McHale as their next state commander. The outgoing

                    <p>In McHale, McNutt found a friend as well as an ally. The two men shared many

                        McNutt, had no use for those who sat on the sidelines, thinking them either

                        <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-106-2-028"/> It was McHale, as legislative leader of
                        the Indiana Legion, who helped persuade the state legislature to build the
                        War Memorial Plaza in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"

                        McNutt, as commander of the Department of Indiana, who presided over the
                        monument&apos;s dedication.<hi rend="sup">108</hi> Between 1928 and 1940,
                        McHale&apos;s skills as a political organizer, his wisdom, and his
                        occasional misjudgments would be the exclusive property of McNutt.</p>
                    <p>By 1928, the post of national commander of the American Legion was beckoning
                        to the increasingly ambitious McNutt. This office was, on one level, a safe
                        one to pursue. There had been calls for McNutt to run for governor of
                                <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                >Indiana</region></placeName> in 1928. He demurred, however, for the
                        Democrats seemed likely to nominate for president, New York Governor Alfred
                        E. Smith. McNutt concluded that, given Hoosiers&apos; &quot;strong
                        prejudices,&quot; the Catholic Smith would drag the Democratic ticket in
                                <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                >Indiana</region></placeName> down to defeat.<hi rend="sup">109</hi>
                        At another level, the position of national commander was a natural fit for
                        McNutt, coming on the heels of his leadership of the Department of Indiana.
                        So, he began his campaign for national commander with trademark expressions
                        of modesty and behind-the-scenes maneuvering.<hi rend="sup">110</hi> He also
                        prodded district leaders in the Indiana Legion to line up behind his
                            candidacy.<hi rend="sup">111</hi>" Then, after two posts endorsed McNutt
                        for national commander, he professed: &quot;Naturally, I cannot disregard
                        such an expression of confidence.&quot;<hi rend="sup">112</hi></p>
                    <p>Securing the support of the Department of Indiana marked the first phase of
                        McNutt&apos;s campaign; lining up other departments in the Midwest was its
                        second part. McNutt&apos;s public speaking in states such as

                        instrumental in managing the final phase of McNutt&apos;s campaign, the
                        period leading up to the national convention in San Antonio. He and McNutt
                        had their work cut out for them. The American Legion, not unlike its Indiana
                        Department, had been run by a clique that had secured the election of the
                        two previous national commanders. In 1928, this machine rallied around the
                        candidacy of John H. Ewing of <placeName><region type="state"
                                key="tgn_7007256" reg="Louisiana">Louisiana</region></placeName>. In
                        response, seven independent candidates emerged as challengers, including
                            McNutt.<hi rend="sup">115</hi> The array of candidates did not bode well
                        for McNutt, who was still new as a leader within Legion circles. So, as he
                        had done when seeking election as state commander, McNutt took a stab at
                        some pre-convention maneuvering, proposing to meet with two of his rivals to
                        affect a &quot;satisfactory settlement&quot;-to the Hoosier, no doubt.<hi
                            rend="sup">116</hi> This effort failed, and the field remained
                            crowded.<hi rend="sup">117</hi> McNutt therefore readied for a &quot;dog

                    <p>McNutt overcame his status as an outsider and an underdog with preparation,
                        organization, tireless speaking, and sheer effort. Not unlike the

                        Hoosier still might win later on, if he could emerge as the second choice of

                    <p>McHale fired the opening salvo of the battle on October 11, when he nominated
                        McNutt. He praised the Hoosier&apos;s army service, emphasized his
                        accomplishments as state commander, and even suggested that McNutt, rather
                        than himself, had secured the requisite funds to build the memorial plaza
                        near the Legion&apos;s national headquarters.<hi rend="sup">122</hi>
                        Although the press had slighted McNutt&apos;s chances, the first round of
                        balloting put him in third place with 189 votes, behind Roy Hoffman of

                        candidate Ewing with 231 votes. On the second ballot, McHale&apos;s
                        &quot;second choice&quot; strategy appeared to pay off as McNutt got 213
                        votes, which placed him behind only Ewing with 245 votes.<hi rend="sup"
                            >123</hi> At that point, Ewing realized that he had peaked and withdrew
                        from the race. On the third ballot, Ewing&apos;s home state of

                        and the delegations from the large states followed suit. Hoffman performed
                        the final act, announcing <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007707"

                        but his audiences were now larger. The raised platform on which he stood
                        allowed him to refine his thinking on topics from patriotic service to
                        veterans&apos; benefits to national defense. On that last issue, he
                        challenged a president of the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"

                        was during the late 1920s and early 1930s that McNutt began to think about
                        occupying the White House himself.<hi rend="sup">128</hi></p>
                    <p>The office of national commander gave McNutt his largest platform yet, and he
                        made the most of it. Looking at his nation in the 1920s, he denounced the
                        freewheeling frivolity and &quot;sordid scramble for gain.&quot;<hi
                            rend="sup">129</hi> Who should be blamed? Not American institutions,
                        McNutt explained to one audience: &quot;The fault lies with our

                            >130</hi> As a former soldier, McNutt looked back fondly on the

                        in his countrymen a sense of service to a greater cause. As a Legionnaire
                        during the Roaring Twenties, he now saw a nation uninterested in
                            sacrifice.<hi rend="sup">131</hi> In response, McNutt continued to extol
                        the virtues of <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"

                        the need to fight pacifists and to fund a strong national defense.</p>
                    <p>These were well-worn themes in McNutt&apos;s speeches, yet two things had
                        changed by this time. First, McNutt had honed his skills and was emerging as
                        a fine speaker. His oratory drew from his years as an undergraduate at IU,
                        where he had majored in English and had acted in plays, and from his
                        training as a lawyer, where he had been taught to be mindful of the facts.

                        <pb n="144" id="VAA4025-106-2-032"/> McNutt worked hard at drafting speeches
                        and often delivered the same address, again and again.<hi rend="sup"
                            >134</hi></p>
                    <p>The second change was that McNutt, as national commander, had integrated his
                        ideas into a coherent train of thought. &quot;The burden of war,&quot; he
                        stressed in one address, &quot;falls upon the citizen soldier.&quot; He thus
                        pressed for a vigorous policy of preparedness to ensure that soldiers had
                        proper training and modern weapons. Such a program promised to reduce
                        casualties in wartime and to ward off aggressors during peace-time.
                        &quot;Adequate national defense is necessary to command respect,&quot;
                        McNutt asserted. To keep <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"
                                reg="United States">America</country></placeName> fit and ready,
                        McNutt pushed the Legion&apos;s campaign to promote civic education.
                        &quot;We are not paid propagandists,&quot; McNutt affirmed, in reference to
                        his fellow Legionnaires, &quot;and we have no selfish interest.&quot;<hi
                            rend="sup">135</hi> The conflict between selfishness and service became
                        personal for him. To one graduating class, McNutt declared: &quot;Your
                        question is what can I do, not what is to be done for me.&quot; And yet, he
                        doubted whether his listeners would perform &quot;unselfish service&quot; to
                                <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">

                    <p>McNutt&apos;s low regard for human nature shaped his hardheaded views on
                        foreign and defense policy. One reason he disdained pacifists was that he
                        doubted that humans possessed sufficient goodness to achieve peace. The
                        reality was that &quot;hate, fear, lust, greed, and envy&quot; in
                        individuals filtered up to nations and their foreign policies.<hi rend="sup"

                                S.</country></placeName>, agreed to renounce war as an instrument of
                        national policy. McNutt dismissed the treaty as a &quot;gesture.&quot;<hi

                        asserting that the &quot;disparity&quot; in navies stemmed from
                        &quot;competitive building&quot; among nations and that negotiation
                        represented the best way to reduce armaments and restore parity at sea.
                        Hoover, a small-government Republican and a Quaker, believed that more arms
                        would lead neither to security nor peace but to &quot;burdensome
                        expenditure&quot; at home and &quot;suspicion, ill will and

                    <p>McNutt&apos;s exchange with Hoover was significant for several reasons.
                        First, Hoover got the better of the argument in the short term, for his
                        position was in accordance with the mindset of the American public following
                        World War I. The <hi rend="i">Akron</hi> (Ohio) <hi rend="i">Beacon

                                <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                                >America</country></placeName> to &quot;squander&quot; money on
                        &quot;military machines&quot; which yield &quot;nothing but death.&quot;<hi
                            rend="sup">149</hi> McNutt&apos;s exchange with a sitting president also
                        underscored the extent to which he was now on the national stage. Reporters
                        thought that Hoover had replied to McNutt, over other critics of his naval
                        policy, because of the &quot;straight forward manner&quot; in which McNutt
                        had made his case and the &quot;splendid national publicity&quot; that his
                        statement had garnered.<hi rend="sup">150</hi></p>
                    <p>The debate over cruisers also revealed that McNutt was willing to seek
                        federal support for projects he deemed worthwhile. The rehabilitation of
                        veterans and the provisioning of their orphans and dependents became his pet
                        projects. McNutt vowed not to rest until &quot;every veteran disabled in the
                        World War receives the care and award to which he is entitled.&quot;<hi
                            rend="sup">151</hi> To that end, he pressed Congress to build more
                        veterans&apos; hospitals and to allow additional time for veterans of World

                        1928, McNutt jotted a Christmas message to former soldiers at hospitals,
                        exhorting them to &quot;be of good cheer,&quot; praising their courage, and
                        pledging to work for them &quot;every day of the year.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                        still thought of veterans. As the Depression set in, he favored, for
                        &quot;moral and economic&quot; reasons, an immediate payout of the bonus to
                        veterans of the Great War. The money was due to them for their service, and
                        its prompt dispersal promised to provide relief by pumping dollars into the
                            economy.<hi rend="sup">156</hi></p>
                    <p>In McNutt&apos;s speeches on behalf of disabled veterans, one can see, to
                        some extent, the origins of his later embrace of the welfare state, as
                        governor of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">
                                Indiana</region></placeName> and as a member of FDR&apos;s
                        administration. McNutt, as national commander, did not see a federal answer
                        to most problems.<hi rend="sup">157</hi> But a concern for disabled veterans
                        led him to espouse, in a general sense, measures to provide care for those
                        whom he dubbed &quot;the unfortunate products of modern civilization.&quot;
                        In an address before the Department of Massachusetts in 1929, McNutt praised
                        the Bay State for adopting forward-looking social policies that had gone
                        &quot;a long way&quot; toward providing some security for its poorer
                        citizens. &quot;The answer to the question, &apos;Am I my brother&apos;s
                        keeper?&apos;&quot; McNutt averred, &quot;is &apos;Yes,&apos; whether we

                        miles as national commander, and had completed a second, more extensive trip
                        to Europe.<hi rend="sup">160</hi> McNutt led a delegation to Paris to
                        dedicate the headquarters of the Legion&apos;s Department of France and to
                        attend the annual nine-nation congress of the Allied Veterans Federation.<hi
                            rend="sup">161</hi> The ceremonial nature of this visit, along with the
                        unique leadership position now occupied by McNutt, enabled him to represent
                        his nation and to meet with foreign leaders, including Pope Pius XI and
                        Premier Benito Mussolini of <placeName><country key="tgn_1000080"

                    <p>McNutt would have been unable to travel, speak, and lead the Legion without
                        the help of a competent staff at the Legion&apos;s headquarters. At their
                        first meeting, McNutt told James E Barton, the national adjutant:
                        &quot;&apos;Jim, you stay here and run things and I&apos;ll go out and put
                        on the medicine show.&apos;&quot;<hi rend="sup">163</hi> What McNutt did, on
                        an institutional level, was to insert himself into the existing bureaucracy,
                        traditions, and agenda of the American Legion rather than reform it. Elected
                        without the support of the organization&apos;s machine, McNutt might have
                        tried to change the manner in which the Legion selected its national
                        commanders. But there is no reason to think that he did so. By 1933,
                        MacNider complained to Theodore Roosevelt Jr., a fellow former national
                        commander, that the Legion was still in the hands of a few
                        &quot;politicos&quot; who &quot;dictate absolutely every job in the
                            outfit.&quot;<hi rend="sup">164</hi> To be certain, such laments-from
                        one Republican to another-reflect the fact that several Democrats, including
                        McNutt and Louis Johnson, who served as national commander from 1932 to
                        1933, were rising to leadership offices within the organization.<hi

                        1921. Meanwhile, the Legion&apos;s lobbyists, no doubt directed by Barton,
                        were able to pry some legislation from Congress, including a

                        <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-106-2-038"/> To exploit McNutt&apos;s ties to
                        veterans, the chair of Indiana&apos;s Democratic Party, R. Earl Peters,
                        invited him to deliver the keynote address at the state party convention in
                            1930.<hi rend="sup">174</hi> McNutt responded with a &quot;rousing piece
                        of oratory&quot; that hailed the Democracy, assailed the Grand Old Party,
                        and closed with an appeal to independent voters.<hi rend="sup">175</hi> Such
                        a plea doubtless stemmed from McNutt&apos;s service in the
                        nonpartisan/bipartisan Legion, and it had a powerful effect. Journalist
                        Harold Feightner conjectured that the typical Indiana Legionnaire saw in
                        McNutt&apos;s budding career &quot;a cause. . . to fight for.&quot;&apos;76
                        Many agreed. A Republican friend of McNutt&apos;s wrote to him after reading
                        his address to the state&apos;s Democrats: &quot;Few men, Paul, are able to
                        command the respect of the opposition ... as you do.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                            >177</hi></p>
                    <p>When McNutt decided to run for governor in 1932, he was uniquely positioned
                        to win. That year, the state GOP, beset by a spate of scandals and the Great
                        Depression, was riding for a fall. Early in 1932, McNutt disclosed his
                        intentions, mobilized supporters, and triumphed in the Democratic primary.
                        Crucial to his successes was his experience in the American Legion, where he
                        had learned how to announce his candidacy for an office, enlist lieutenants,
                        plot strategy, and prevail at official gatherings.<hi rend="sup">178</hi>
                        Moreover, Legionnaires formed a major component of McNutt&apos;s bid to
                        become governor.<hi rend="sup">179</hi> A trio of Legion members comprised
                        the campaign&apos;s brain trust: Bowman Elder collected financial
                        contributions; Pleas Greenlee served as secretary and oversaw the formation
                        of McNutt-for-Governor Clubs; and Frank McHale managed the enterprise as a
                            whole.<hi rend="sup">180</hi></p>
                    <p>The campaign staff&apos;s most notable innovation was the McNutt-for-Governor
                        Clubs, which they built outside the regular party outfit to <list

                            <item><hi rend="sup">179</hi>McNutt remained conscious of the need to
                                avoid involving the American Legion, as an organization, in partisan
                                politics. For that reason, he declined an offer to announce his

                        as well as Democrats.<hi rend="sup">181</hi> This sensible effort
                        nevertheless irritated older Democrats. Long-serving party chieftains held a
                        bifurcated view of these newcomers from the Legion, seeing them as
                        &quot;engines of party victory&quot; on the one hand, and as
                        &quot;politically ambitious veterans&quot; who were challenging &quot;the
                        party&apos;s established order&quot; on the other.<hi rend="sup">182</hi>
                        Claude R. Wickard, a Democrat who won election to the state senate in 1932,
                        recalled the &quot;McNutt group&quot; as being &quot;younger and . . . newer
                        and . . . more liberal than the old Democratic organization which had been
                        in control in the twenties.&quot;<hi rend="sup">183</hi> In the long run,
                        the Legionnaires who had infiltrated the state party became known, somewhat
                        disdainfully, as the &quot;boy scouts.&quot;<hi rend="sup">184</hi>
                        Nevertheless, in the short run, McHale and company had the organization and
                        the votes to nominate McNutt for governor, by acclamation, at the state
                        party convention in June 1932.<hi rend="sup">185</hi></p>
                    <p>The pique of many senior party officials was part of a larger phenomenon: the
                        rise of veterans as a force in the 1932 elections in <placeName><region
                                type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName>. During that campaign, the GOP nominated
                        for governor Raymond S. Springer, who had been the first commander of the
                        Legion&apos;s Department of Indiana.<hi rend="sup"> 186</hi> Such changes
                        suggested a generational shift in <placeName><region type="state"

                        politics. As the campaign drew to a close, Feightner, writing in the <hi
                            rend="i">New York Times</hi>, contrasted young guard Democrat McNutt
                        with another statewide candidate, incumbent U. S. Senator (and Majority
                        Leader) James E. Watson, a quintessential partisan wheelhorse and an old

                    <p>McNutt&apos;s status as a veteran and as a former national commander of the

                        McNutt with Watson, and with not Springer, on the grounds that the one-time
                        Legion commander and the current Senate leader were both &quot;nationally
                        known figures.<hi rend="sup">188</hi> McNutt&apos;s candidacy drew wide

                            >Journal</hi> sent a reporter to Indiana to cover the youthful
                        dean/Legionnaire/Democrat. This correspondent observed that McNutt was
                        engaging in a new manner of campaigning by making the candidate, rather than
                        the party and its symbols, the chief attraction.<hi rend="sup">189</hi> With
                        respect to politics in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, such a strategy did not
                        hurt McNutt at all, for &quot;even earthy Hoosiers were convinced that this
                        man was above the average politician in ability.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                            >190</hi> In November, McNutt defeated Springer by winning fifty-five
                        percent of the vote-a record for a gubernatorial candidate in

                    <p> With respect to national politics, McNutt&apos;s experience as a national
                        commander of the American Legion hurt rather than helped him in 1932. After
                        McNutt won his party&apos;s nomination for governor, he began to think that
                        something bigger lay ahead. The Democratic National Convention opened in

                        with candidates for the presidential nomination. According to the

                        nomination of McNutt for president, in an encore of the Legion&apos;s

                        his later career in three respects. First, McNutt brought the symbolic

                        brimmed with pomp and circumstance in part because the Legion was front and

                            commander.<hi rend="sup">198</hi> Not unlike McNutt&apos;s campaign for
                        governor, the ceremony was stage-managed to spotlight the new executive and
                        to signify a shift in state politics. Former Governor James P. Goodrich, a
                        Republican, wrote of the day: &quot;McNutt inaugurated with a lot of fuss
                        and feathers for a Democrat.&quot;<hi rend="sup">199</hi></p>
                    <p>Secondly, McNutt drew upon his background in the military and the American
                        Legion as he sought to calm Hoosiers and rally their spirits during the
                        Great Depression. In his inaugural address, he acknowledged an economic
                        crisis &quot;as grim and as real as any war&quot; and called on the
                        &quot;unselfish service, energy, intelligence and solidarity&quot; of
                        Hoosiers to meet the challenges ahead, as they had during the First World
                            War.<hi rend="sup">200</hi> McNutt set the pace. Although tainted by
                        machine-style tactics, his administration reorganized the state&apos;s
                        government and reformed its tax system; tightened regulation of banking and
                        of liquor; passed pensions for the aged; centralized the state&apos;s
                        control over poor relief; and worked with FDR&apos;s government to provide
                        jobs to the unemployed and Social Security for the elderly.<hi rend="sup"
                            >201</hi> Although these programs cannot be traced directly to his years
                        in the Legion, those designed to help the needy were, in a very general
                        sense, consistent with his support of veterans&apos; aid programs. Moreover,
                        as McNutt pushed through his agenda, he continued to invoke military-style
                        analogies. Even in hard times, he once insisted, &quot;we can order a charge
                        and can move forward with courage.&quot;<hi rend="sup">202</hi></p>
                    <p>Thirdly, McNutt retained the same realistic outlook on foreign affairs that
                        he had exhibited as national commander of the Legion. After McNutt left the
                        governorship in 1937, he became, at FDR&apos;s invitation, U.S. high
                        commissioner to the <placeName><country key="tgn_1000135" reg="Pilipinas"
                                >Philippine Islands </country></placeName>. There, he challenged the
                        administration&apos;s policy by advocating a reappraisal of Philippine
                        independence, set to take place in 1946. Instead, McNutt favored &quot;a
                        permanent political and economic relationship&quot; between the

                        political ideology, one that would dominate the years immediately following
                        World War II. By the late 1930s and early 1940s, McNutt might be described
                        as an early cold war liberal-a proponent of the welfare/warfare state who
                        wanted to promote economic security for Americans at home and national

                        whereby the federal government would protect Americans from privation,
                        subversives, and predatory dictators. The liberal tradition would evolve in
                        new directions after 1945, embracing such issues as civil rights for racial
                        minorities. But the notion of security lay at the heart of the emerging
                        postwar consensus.<hi rend="sup">211</hi> Unfortunately for McNutt, a
                        succession of events beyond his control, such as FDR&apos;s decision to seek
                        a third term, prevented him from occupying the office to which Truman
                        ascended in 1945.</p>
                    <p>The American Legion proved a boon to McNutt, though only to a point. The
                        organization was, in many respects, made for him. It was inclusive-of
                        veterans of World War I, whether or not they had fought-patriotic,
                        service-oriented, and anti-radical. Such values mirrored McNutt&apos;s own.
                        Also, the Legion&apos;s structure and its revolving leadership, with
                        one-year terms for both state and national commanders, opened opportunities
                        for driven men, such as McNutt, to achieve distinction and to head an
                        institution. Leadership of the Legion alone was no royal road to securing a
                        spot on a national ticket-as McNutt discovered in 1932. But through it, as
                        McNutt&apos;s experience also showed, it was possible to gain both renown
                        and nomination to a lower level office, from which one might launch a
                        political career.</p>

                    focused on the history of the Northwest Territory and published by the Fergus

                    volume 26 reprinted William Henry Harrison&apos;s 1838 <hi rend="i">Aborigines
                        of the Ohio Valley</hi>; the second part was Beckwith&apos;s &quot;The
                    Fort-Wayne Manuscript,&quot; which was itself divided into two sections: the
                    first titled &quot;Indian Speeches at Fort Wayne&quot; and the second, &quot;The
                    Manners and Customs of the North-Western Indians.&quot;</p>
                <p>In his introduction, Beckwith claimed the unnamed author of &quot;Manners and
                    Customs&quot; must have been &quot;a well-informed and candid writer. His
                    statements of facts, dates, names, etc., harmonize in the main with creditable
                    works since in print.... He must have had an intimate and long acquaintance with
                    the Indians; and the information preserved in his manuscript...is, for the most
                    part, not only new, but valuable historical matter.&quot;<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    Beckwith did not speculate about who might have written this valuable treatise
                    on Miami culture. However, the publisher&apos;s advertisement on the
                    volume&apos;s next-to-last page explicitly stated a connection between &quot;The
                    Manners and Customs of the North-Western Indians&quot; and one of the most
                    important participants in Indian-white relations in territorial

                    St. Clair&apos;s had been. Shot in the wrist on one daring exploit, Wells ceased

                    to confirm Hunt&apos;s attribution to Wells. Even the author&apos;s disavowal of

                    were fought between [the Indians and the French and British] is derived from the

                    depended on&quot;) suggests the perspective of a close observer such as
                        Wells.<hi rend="sup">20</hi></p>
                <p>While Hunt expressed no doubts about the manuscript&apos;s authenticity, he did
                    not state how he had acquired it. One possible clue appears in a footnote
                    included in an essay entitled &quot;Harmar&apos;s Expedition,&quot; which
                    appeared in the April 1820 issue of Hunt&apos;s magazine, between the
                    publication dates of the two Wells pieces. The essay&apos;s author, known only
                    as &quot;G,&quot; acknowledges receiving information from Wells, &quot;who was
                    with the Indians at the time.&quot;<hi rend="sup">21</hi> If &quot;G&quot; had
                    been in direct contact with Wells before the latter&apos;s death, perhaps he was
                    the person who passed Wells&apos;s manuscript on to Hunt.</p>
                <p>Wells may have intended for his writings to form part of an autobiography.
                    Certainly he had a fascinating story to tell, and Hunt implied that the essays
                    had been drawn from a larger manuscript. John D. Hunter&apos;s captivity
                    narrative, published in 1823, combined an account of the &quot;Manners and
                    Customs of Several Indian Tribes&quot; along with the &quot;Life of the
                        Author.&quot;<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Perhaps Wells had a similar plan in mind
                    for his manuscript. Except for a year or so of schooling in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013915" reg="Louisville"
                            >Louisville</settlement></placeName> before his capture, Wells was
                    self-taught. He had a gift for languages, however, and was capable of recording
                    the story of his remarkable life. Wells was a significant participant in major
                    events of his time and place, and he had the rare ability to see both the Indian
                    and white sides of issues. On the other hand, Wells&apos;s untimely death may
                    have robbed him of the chance to write a full account of his adventures.<hi

                    volume 26 suggests, more of Wells&apos;s work may have survived than historians
                    have generally acknowledged. In spite of claims contained in Hunt&apos;s 1820
                    paragraph and in the 1883 advertisement, few historians of the period have made
                    significant use of the documents contained within &quot;The Fort-Wayne

                    transcription of Wells&apos;s translation of the Indian speeches at the council
                    as they were given. The year after Wells was killed, Turner resigned his
                    commission and began a campaign to obtain Wells&apos;s old job as Indian agent
                    for the Miami at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933"

                    married Wells&apos;s and Sweet Breeze&apos;s daughter, Anne. He began to style
                    himself William Turner of Wellsington, after the formal name given to
                    Wells&apos;s extensive land holdings in <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    In letters to her sister, Anne expressed dissatisfaction with her life,
                    lamenting Turner&apos;s frequent absences, his excessive spending, and his
                    drinking. Despite his shortcomings, Turner managed to be named secretary to the
                    Treaty of St. Mary&apos;s in 1818, and shortly thereafter he was finally
                    appointed Indian agent for the Miami. However, this long-sought position was
                    short-lived; in 1820 he was fired for &quot;unsatisfactory conduct&quot; and he
                    died in 1821, no doubt as a direct result of his heavy drinking.<hi rend="sup"
                        >27</hi> Like many frontiersmen of his time, Turner was a man on the make,
                    determined to get what he wanted by whatever means necessary. He did possess
                    some degree of knowledge about Miami life and customs, through his work with
                    Wells.</p>
                <p>Based on my study of the documents, I believe that, following his marriage to
                    Anne Wells in 1815, William Turner came into possession of a copy of the Wells
                    manuscript from which the 1820 Western Review articles were drawn. In 1817,
                    probably in order to enhance his qualifications as Indian agent, he claimed
                    authorship for himself, revising phrasing, correcting diction, and changing
                    details. Then, some time between 1817 and his own death in 1821, Turner
                    apparently made a few further revisions in the manuscript, which was finally
                    published anonymously as &quot;The Fort-Wayne Manuscript&quot; in 1883.<hi

                            establish that Wells was the author of the original manuscript published

                <p>Reading these materials together, and at least tentatively ascribing to Wells
                    their common origin, improves our understanding of Indian-white relations in

                    Wells&apos;s account is illuminating in relation to Indian battles, especially
                    those of the 1790s in which Wells participated; the second part on &quot;Manners
                    and Customs&quot; richly supplements Trowbridge&apos;s seminal document by
                    providing first-hand observations of how the Miami lived in the late eighteenth
                    and very early nineteenth centuries. Wells&apos;s knowledge was based on his
                    life among them from 1784 to 1792, as well as on his subsequent twenty years of
                    service mainly at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933"

                    account relied almost exclusively on his interviews with two elderly chiefs, Le
                    Gros and Jean Baptiste Richardville (Peshewa, &quot;The Wildcat&quot;), during
                    the winter of 1824-25. Therefore, when the two accounts are in conflict,
                    Wells&apos;s statements might be more reliable than those found in Trowbridge,
                    since the Miami were clearly suffering considerable dissolution at the time of
                    his interviews and his informants were very old. Le Gros, for example, says that
                    nowadays &quot;children abuse their parents and very often when intoxicated,
                    beat them,&quot; and &quot;now nothing is more common, particularly when they
                    are drunk, to abuse &amp; sometimes beat their wives.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                    on women than does Wells&apos;s account; it includes detail on the role of women
                    chiefs, females going on the warpath, mourning rituals, adoption ceremonies, the
                    naming of children, courtship rituals and marriage practices, women&apos;s work,
                    as well as the men known as &quot;White Faces,&quot; who assumed the roles of

                    scholars of the period now have two invaluable sources to consult when they

                    <p>The French was the first nation of white people that ever was known among the
                        north western Indians. When the British and French commenced a war against
                        each other in North America, the north western Indians joined the French,
                        and several of the six nations joined the British.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> My
                        knowledge of the actions that were fought between them is derived from the
                        old Indians whom I have conversed with on that subject, and is perhaps not
                        to be depended on.</p>
                    <p>After the British got possession of this country from the French, a Tawway
                        chief, by the name of Pantaock,<hi rend="sup">33</hi> renewed the war
                        against them, and took in one day all the posts that were occupied by them
                        on the Lakes and their waters, Detroit excepted, by stratagem. After this,
                        in 1774, the war broke out between the north western Indians and the Whites.
                        The principal action that was fought between the parties was at the mouth of
                        the great Kanhaway.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> There were three hundred Shawanees
                        and Delawares, and a few Miamies, Wyandots, and Mingoes, commanded by the

                        and determined enemies: they will go great lengths to serve their friends,
                        and equally far to punish their enemies. The men are trained to hunting and
                        war, whilst all the menial work is left for the women.</p>
                    <p>Each nation is divided into villages, and each village has one or more chiefs
                        according to its size, who keep their servants in order by persuasion, as
                        arbitrary power is never used except in cases of murder. There are but few
                        chiefs whose influence extends farther than among the people of their
                        respective villages.</p>

                        day in cold water. The time a child must fast is regulated by its age. Thus
                        a child of eight years old will fast half a day and one of twelve or more
                        will go without food and drink all day. The child, while it is fasting, has
                        its face blacked and is made to wash before eating. The face of the male is
                        blacked all over; that of the female on the cheeks only. The male quits this
                        practice at the age of eighteen years, and the female at the age of
                        fourteen. When the boy arrives at the age of eighteen, it is said by his
                        parents that his education is complete and that he is old enough to be a

                        hut built for him out of bushes or weeds. After this he is addressed by his
                        father or guardian in the following words: &quot;My son, it has pleased all
                        the great spirits that dwell above the skies and those that dwell on the
                        earth that you should live to see this day: they have all seen your conduct
                        since I first blacked your face: they know whether you have at all times
                        strictly adhered to the advice I have given you; and I hope they will reward
                        you accordingly. You must remain here until myself or some other friend
                        shall come for you.&quot; The man then returns home, takes his gun, and goes
                        hunting while his son is left five or six, and sometimes eight, days without
                        any thing to eat or drink. When the father has procured meat for a feast, he
                        invites some of his neighbours to come and partake of what he has: they
                        accompany him to where his son has been for days: the boy is then taken home
                        and bathed in cold water, his head shaved all over except a small part on
                        the top. Food is then given him which had been prepared in a separate vessel
                        for that purpose. After he has done eating, a looking glass and a bag of

                        blacked, which is at day break, he takes his bow and goes to the woods, and

                        operated on by fears: they are made to believe that if they should eat or
                        drink with their faces blacked it would be followed by immediate punishment

                        binding upon the parties concerned. When an Indian has a son whom he wishes
                        to see married to some good woman, he assembles his friends and relations
                        and advises with them what woman his son shall marry. When a choice is made,
                        the relations of the young man collect what presents they think sufficient
                        for the occasion, go to the parents of the intended bride, make their wishes
                        known, leave the articles they take with them, and return without waiting
                        for an answer.</p>

                        they agree to the match, they collect suitable presents, dress the girl in
                        her best clothes, and take her to those who made application for the match,
                        when it is considered that the marriage is completed. If on the contrary she
                        or her friends disapprove the match, the presents from the friends of the
                        young man are returned, which is considered as a refusal.</p>
                    <p>When an Indian wishes to go to war, he informs one or two of his most
                        intimate friends of his intention, and asks them if they will go with him.
                        The party is then made up by their informing as many as they wish. Their
                        intentions are kept a secret from all others, as the man who is to command
                        wishes to have those only who will at all times cheerfully obey his orders.
                        The party always leaves the villages in the night secretly. When they encamp
                        the captain places the oldest in front and the youngest in the rear. The
                        former do all the hunting for the party and keep a strict watch for the
                        enemy: the latter cook, make fires, and mend the moccasons [sic] of the

                    <p>Every war party has a small budget called the war budget, which contains
                        something belonging to each of the party, and representing some animal, as

                        a mink&apos;s skin, or the feathers of some extraordinary bird. This budget
                        is considered sacred, and is carried by some person chosen for that purpose,
                        who always marches in front, and leads the party to the enemy. He is never
                        passed on the march by any of the party, while he has the budget on his
                        back. When the party halts, the budget is laid on the ground in front of
                        them, and no person is permitted to pass it without orders from <list

                        four-legged animal is killed by the party, the heart is carefully preserved
                        by a person appointed for that purpose. When they encamp, a fire is built by
                        the side of the war budget, and the heart of the animal slain is cut up into
                        small pieces and burnt. The sticks intended to roast meat on are formed with
                        a slit, in which the meat is placed: the other end being sharpened for the

                    <p>When the enemy is to be attacked the war budget is opened, and each man takes
                        out his emblem and ties it to that part of his body directed by his
                        ancestors. An Indian when he attacks his enemy is generally nearly naked,
                        and his body is painted with different colours, commonly red. After the
                        action is over, each person returns his war bag to the commander of the
                        party, who wraps them all up carefully and gives the budget to the man who
                        has taken the first prisoner or scalp and he is entitled to the honor of
                        leading the party home in triumph. The war budget is then hung in front of
                        the door of the person that carried it on the march against the enemy, where
                        it is left hanging for thirty or forty days, and some one of the party sings
                        and dances near it. When the man who commanded thinks proper, he assembles
                        the party and a feast is prepared for the people of the village, who sing
                        and dance all night. Those of the party who injured the enemy most serve out
                        the feast to the people. The war budget is then opened by the man that
                        commanded, each of them takes his war bag, and the party is dissolved.</p>

                        oftener, by preparing a kettle full of victuals and a few pipes of tobacco,
                        and singing all night the songs he has been taught by his ancestors, which
                        may be called religious songs. He invites his neighbours to come and eat the

                        together, after which they proceed to eating with a great deal of ceremony.

                        white men. Some of them have told me that there were two other worlds to

                        frequently happens that two persons are chosen to fill the vacancy.</p>
                    <p>When every thing is ready, the person or persons are sent for, and the
                        ceremony begins. If the deceased were a warrior, the adoption is exhibited
                        by the warriors of the village who assemble at the house of the deceased,
                        dance the war dance, and sing the war song in rotation. The warrior goes
                        through all the actions he performed when he was engaged with his enemy,
                        after which he repeats to the assembly the number of actions he has been in
                        and the number of scalps he has taken, occasionally giving the same yells
                        and using the same words he uttered when he was in battle. During all the
                        time there is a constant yelling of the war whoop by the assembly. When the
                        warrior has gone through such of his war exploits as he thinks proper, he
                        hands the war club to some other warrior, and sits down: the other rises and
                        repeats as many of his war exploits as he thinks proper in the same way, and
                        thus the dance is continued until each warrior of the village is called on
                        to relate his war exploits. Some are even called on two or three times. The
                        assembly is then dismissed by the speaker of the friends of the deceased,
                        who declares that their hearts are glad. The person adopted, who during the
                        dance sits among the relations of the deceased, is then moved by his new
                        relations to a private room, where he receives every thing that belonged to
                        the deceased, as well as the articles of clothing that had been received
                        from the neighbours. He is then told that he is one of the family and is
                        considered as such, and that he is entitled to the same authority in the
                        nation as the person whose place he fills.</p>

                        continues until morning when the feast is served up to the company. Another
                        dance is performed by a certain society. Each member of the society is
                        supposed to possess secret arts by which he can destroy the life of his
                        neighbours when he pleases, without its being known to them or any one else.
                        Persons of both sexes are adopted into this society with a great deal of
                            ceremony.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> When they dance it is common for each
                        person to have an otter skin. The oldest members place themselves in the
                        middle of the floor, and the dance begins by their singing the songs of the
                        society. A circle is formed around the singers and each person commences
                        dancing with his otter skin in his hand. After a few minutes some one of the
                        company makes a noise like an otter, shakes his skin and walks or dances
                        round the inside of the circle, suddenly making a motion with his skin at
                        some one of the company, who screams out and falls as if he had been shot.
                        In a few moments he recovers and in his turn loads his otter skin,
                        pretending to cough up the ball he was just shot with. When it appears that
                        the ball is in his mouth, he puts the nose of the otter skin to his mouth
                        and his piece is loaded. He then goes round the circle as was before done,
                        and shoots any one he pleases.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> In this way the dance

                        neighbours, but are now treated with great contempt.</p>
                    <p>The begging dance is performed by young men and boys, who dress like warriors
                        and go about through the village singing war songs and dancing. It is
                        customary for the heads of families, at whose house they dance, to give them
                        something. This is the dance they generally exhibit among white people.
                        There are a number of other dances, such as the bear dance, the turkey

                        of the heads of each family of his village, and lays the business before
                        them on which he means to deliberate.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> An orator then
                        rises, and, after stating the importance of the business, gives his opinion
                        to the council. Should the council concur with him, nothing more is said,
                        but the council is adjourned by the chief. Should a difference of opinion
                        prevail among the counselors, the subject is debated by the different
                        parties, after which the chief adjourns them as before. When the chief gives
                        his final answer to any thing that is thought of importance, it is done in
                        the presence of his counsellors. No business is done by him privately. No
                        crime among the Indians is punished with death, excepting murder; in which
                        case the chiefs and old men assemble and inquire into the nature of the act,
                        and if, after they are informed of the particulars of the transaction, they
                        are of opinion that the accused acted in his own defence, or that there was
                        something that authorised him to kill the other, they make a present to the
                        friends of the deceased, and tell them they have wiped away the blood, but
                        that if they are the cause of spilling more blood, the vengeance of the
                        village will fall on them. If, on the contrary, they find the person has
                        been murdered without cause, they say nothing to his relations, but leave
                        them to punish the murderer as they think proper, which is generally with
                        death.</p>
                    <p>The Indians live in villages from April to November, during which time the

                        vegetables. The men seldom assist their women in farming. Little Turtle and
                        a young Weas chief are the only two Indians that I know <list

                        of the year is spent in hunting. The Indians appear to decrease in number,
                        particularly those who live nearest the white settlements, perhaps in
                        consequence of the scarcity of game and their continual intoxication. The
                        Indians divide the time as the whites do, by moons, and into four seasons,
                        autumn, winter, spring and summer. January is called Buck moon, February the
                        Bear, March the Young Bear, April the Crow, May the Crane, June the
                        Whippoorwill, July the Cornhilling moon, August the Roasting Ear, September
                        the Hard Corn, October the Little Fire, November the Big Fire, and December
                        the Young Buck moon.<hi rend="sup">73</hi></p>
                    <p>The Indians hold property individually, but are not so fond of it as the
                        whites are. They are much kinder to their neighbors and to strangers than
                        the whites are.</p>
                    <p>The Indians have no laws, no coercive power, nor any kind of government.
                        Their only contracts are their manners and customs, and that moral sense of
                        right and wrong, which, like the sense of tasting and feeling in every man,
                        makes a part of his nature. An offence against them is punished with
                        contempt and exclusion from society, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>The Indians believe that the thunder and lightning and other disturbances of
                        the natural world, are independent and distinct powers or beings, and
                        worship them occasionally.</p>
                    <p>The Powwowers or Priests were formerly in high estimation, as it is believed
                        that they are the agents of the different powers, or great spirits that
                        govern the universe, and that they have power to kill or cure as they think
                        proper. They generally act as doctors, and sometimes go through the village
                        early in the morning preaching, and tell the people what to do during the
                            day.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> They are not so much respected now as they
                        formerly were. I have never understood that the North Western Indians buried
                        their dead in any other way, than as at present. Some lay the dead body on
                        the top of the ground, make a crib or pen over it, and cover it with bark.
                        Others dig graves and lay the corpse in, and cover it first with bark and
                        then with earth. Others still make a coffin out of strong boards, <list

                    at various times from one or another of these separate versions of the
                    Ishmaelites&apos; story, and by treating as fact details that do not stand up to
                    independent verification, scholars seeking to understand the Tribe&apos;s
                    significance to the development of eugenic thought have at times confused rather
                    than clarified the story. I have studied the Ishmaelites for some time, and hope
                    that my findings might save other scholars time and energy.</p>
                <p>According to his diary, McCulloch discovered the Tribe on January 18, 1878, just
                    ten weeks after he and Rev. Myron Reed had read and preached upon Richard
                    Dugdale&apos;s <hi rend="i">The Jukes</hi> (1877).<hi rend="sup"> 6</hi> The
                    book became the inspiration for McCulloch&apos;s study of the Tribe. McCulloch
                    wrote three accounts of his first encounter with seven desperately poor people
                    -a man, his mother, two younger women, and three children-and each account is
                    slightly different.</p>
                <p>The second account, the first public mention of the Tribe, is in McCulloch&apos;s
                    1880 paper to the National Conference of Charities and Correction. The account
                    resembles that found in his diary, but subtle changes have been introduced. The
                    man who had been described as half-blind is no longer so. The second woman,
                    first identified as his wife&apos;s sister, is now his sibling, and her child is
                    reported to be the result of incest. McCulloch also altered his diary, reducing
                    one of the women&apos;s offspring from four children to two. In the third
                    account, the two younger women&apos;s (now) three children switched mothers, and
                    the woman previously identified as the man&apos;s sister again became his
                    wife&apos;s sibling. These inconsistencies are odd, and one suspects that they
                    were invented, claims-making accounts. The same suspicion arises over
                    McCulloch&apos;s ever larger and more alarming counts of the Tribe&apos;s
                        numbers.<hi rend="sup">7</hi></p>

                <p>When McCulloch went to the township trustee, he found the original seven people
                    listed as Ishmaelites, a.k.a. the &quot;pesthouse&quot; mob.<hi rend="sup"
                        >8</hi> This is quite plausible, because twenty-seven of the thirty
                    addresses given for George Ishmael in the 1874 to 1923 city directories were in
                    the old City Hospital or pesthouse neighborhood,<hi rend="sup">9</hi> that is,

                    current IUPUI medical campus. The census records and city directories document
                    the occupational shifts of the illiterate family members from ash- and
                    swill-collecting laborers and teamsters to junk dealers by 1910. However, as
                    Nathaniel Deutsch demonstrates, McCulloch&apos;s history of the Ishmael family
                    is largely fictitious.</p>
                <p>In the pages of the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi>, Brent Ruswick asserts that
                    McCulloch&apos;s attitude toward the Tribe softened over time, and that while he
                    began with hereditarian remedies for their pauperism, he eventually shifted to
                    environmental ones. Yet, unlike Dugdale, McCulloch never pondered the relative
                    importance of hereditary versus environmental determinants of the
                    Ishmaelites&apos; pauperism.<hi rend="sup"> 10</hi> It was, after all, a family

                <p>While elements of McCulloch&apos;s history suggest a drift away from biological
                    determinism, he also believed that children had to be removed from their
                    families to escape hereditary pauperism. And his 1891 presidential address to
                    the National Conference of Charities and Correction advocated the creation of a
                    national registry of the dependent, defective, and delinquent classes.<hi

                <p>When I arrived at the Indiana State Library in early 2003, Robert Horton&apos;s
                    articles had already convinced me that the Tribe of Ishmael, McCulloch&apos;s
                    intermarried &quot;pauper ganglion,&quot; was a hoax.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> I
                    shared this conviction with a librarian, and was then shown the 1822 probated
                    record of Benjamin Ishmael&apos;s 1813 will,<hi rend="sup">15</hi> which lists
                    most of the same children as J. Frank Wright&apos;s manuscript on the Tribe. I
                    turned to the city directories and census records, and found the historical
                    Ishmaels of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"

                <p>Much of what we think we know about the Ishmaelites derives from Wright&apos;s
                    unpublished manuscript and its seductive, anecdotal accounts of the seamy side
                    of life. Kramer and Deutsch, in particular, have depended upon the Wright
                    manuscript as a basis for their own interpretations.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                    Wright&apos;s account, however, is problematic as a primary source. He had
                    prepared it for Arthur H. Estabrook, who then left it with Amos Butler before

                <p>Still other examples of Wright&apos;s fictitious characters are Hiram and Melinda
                    Rogers and their family. Wright claimed that the Rogers were early settlers of

                    the 1860 census reveals that the real Hiram and Melinda were twelve-year-old
                    twins on their parents&apos; farm, and that two of their alleged sons were their
                    six- and eight-year-old brothers. Wright&apos;s manuscript contains the names of
                    real people, but assigns them fictitious histories, dates, and states of origin.
                    There is an entirely appropriate sense of irony in Dr. Thurman B. Rice&apos;s
                    judgment that &quot;Many of the statements made by Mr. Wright are amazing beyond
                        belief.&quot;<hi rend="sup">20</hi></p>
                <p>It should be noted that the final pages of Wright&apos;s notes for Estabrook
                    include a pointed critique of eugenics theory, which begins: &quot;Physical and
                    mental conditions are inheritable conditions; morals are no more a matter of
                    inheritance than shoes.&quot;<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Wright (1851-1927) almost
                    certainly knew his contemporary, George Ishmael (1849/50-1926). They may have
                    met in 1881, when the city directory listed Wright as the proprietor of a feed
                    and seed store at 178 Indiana Avenue, adjoining the City Hospital neighborhood.
                    Whatever the case, the &quot;notorious wandering family, well named
                    Ishmael&quot; had already appeared in the 1902 and 1911 published summaries of
                    Wright&apos;s work on the early slums of <placeName><settlement type="city"

                <p>Wright evidently joined Estabrook&apos;s study of the Tribe in 1916 at age
                    sixty-five. The city directory for that year listed Estabrook as an

                    was pursuing several projects. He probably welcomed assistance from one who had
                    assembled the Tribe&apos;s genealogical diagram, and the compensation Wright
                    received from his typewritten sketches must have helped make ends meet. The
                    directories list no occupation for Wright from 1917-18, when Estabrook was away
                    in the Army. Wright was a watchman from 1919-20, and an elevator operator from
                    1921 until his death in 1927.</p>
                <p>Estabrook, the author of two earlier studies of cacogenic families,<hi rend="sup"
                        >24</hi> came to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"
                            reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> in 1916 as an
                    agent of Amos W Butler&apos;s Society for Mental Hygiene to assess the size of
                    the state&apos;s mentally defective population.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> In
                    addition, Charles B. Davenport, director of the Eugenics Record Office, wanted
                    Estabrook to resurrect the study of the Tribe of Ishmael, and Harry L. Laughlin,
                    in 1921, asked him to investigate a possible test case for a new state eugenic
                    sterilization law.<hi rend="sup">26</hi></p>
                <p>Rather than being, as some have suggested, a second, independent sociological
                    study of the Tribe of Ishmael, Estabrook&apos;s unpublished 1922 work draws
                    freely from Wright&apos;s manuscript, and Estabrook acknowledges the assistance.
                    In fact, nine (60 percent) of Estabrook&apos;s fifteen families are obvious
                    rewrites of Wright&apos;s sketches. Apart from a stress upon feeblemindedness
                    and attention to the Tribe&apos;s occupations and the Ishmael family&apos;s junk
                    business, there is little new material of any kind. But there is, as Kramer
                    notes, a distinct shift in tone. Estabrook&apos;s descriptions are less
                    outrageous than Wright&apos;s. Not surprisingly, however, the eugenical
                    fieldworker found a rate of feeblemindedness three times higher-16 percent
                    versus 5 percent-than Wright suggests, and he did so without actually testing
                    any of his subjects.</p>
                <p>It was Estabrook&apos;s army service that allowed him to perform his behavioral
                    assessments of the Ishmaelites&apos; intelligence. Estabrook&apos;s time in

                    psychological officer with the Robert M. Yerkes Army Sanitary Corps. From April
                    to September 1918 he helped identify feebleminded inductees by administering the
                    celebrated Army Intelligence Tests; thereafter he was engaged in &quot;advising
                    and lecturing to officers on methods of [troop] training.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                        >27</hi> In doing so, he must have utilized Yerkes&apos;s new scale of
                    occupational intelligence grades. Engineer officers were assigned an A level
                    (very superior) intelligence, whereas laborers or teamsters (like the Ishmael
                    family men) received a C minus level, indicating low average intelligence.<hi

                <p>Estabrook&apos;s study of the Tribe was never published. Harry L. Laughlin had
                    replaced Charles B. Davenport as head of the Eugenics Record Office in 1921.
                    Davenport had been interested in cacogenic families and the Tribe of Ishmael,
                    but Laughlin was interested in more practical issues such as eugenic
                    sterilization, racial integrity laws, and immigration restriction. Thus
                    Estabrook left <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"
                            reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> in 1922 to

                    hereditarily nomadic, Muslim hunter-fishers who refused to seek wage labor
                    slavery, and so were persecuted by McCulloch&apos;s charities and the
                    eugenicists who followed. Leaming&apos;s Tribe then migrated to

                <p>There is no evidence for these claims, other than the fact that three of George

                    Delaware or Miami Indians, or the Conner brothers. While some would say this
                    lack of evidence suggests that these Ishmaelites did not exist, Leaming

                <p>Leaming&apos;s brand of revisionist history walks a fine line between outright

                    one of his admirers tells of this white Unitarian Virginian&apos;s 1989 address

                <p>Today, the term &quot;Western artists&quot; typically evokes painters and
                    sculptors such as Frederick Remington and Charles Russell, both especially known
                    for their romantic post-Civil War images of cowboys, Indians, and the Rocky

                    landscape and themselves as fundamentally &quot;Western,&quot; as the citizens
                    of an American region-we call it the Midwest today-that they believed was
                    distinctive from both the East Coast and the &quot;far&quot; West.</p>
                <p>Cultural recognition was central to this demarcation of regional distinctiveness,
                    and various initiatives were undertaken to alert the rest of the nation about
                    how the Middle West was &quot;hospitable&quot; to the &quot;cultivation of fine
                    arts&quot; (p. 2). These included organizing cultural institutions like art
                    museums (Chicago&apos;s Art Institute was established in 1879, and the Detroit
                    Museum of Art opened in 1885), hosting world&apos;s fairs (such as the Columbian

                    World&apos;s Fair in 1904), and forming artist collectives like the Society of

                    Although private art galleries existed at the time, artist-run groups were
                    especially responsible for exhibitions, sales, and critical reputation,
                    basically serving as the primary entree to art world success. This beautifully

                    shows that the Society of Western Artists held for nineteen years, and their

                <p>Most members of the society painted landscapes, rendered in an American style of
                    Impressionism that embraced a loose approach to light and color but remained
                    solidly rooted in the designs and details of the material world. Trained in
                    Europe, Steele&apos;s earliest work consisted mainly of portraits, but he became
                    a leading figure in the &quot;Hoosier Group,&quot; a group of Indiana painters
                    whose &quot;plein air&quot; landscapes (basically, paintings produced outside
                    rather than in a studio) won acclaim at an exhibition in <placeName><settlement

                    accepted into the annual juried shows of the National Academy of Design (and
                    elected a member of the New York-based Academy in 1913), Steele was adamant
                    about galvanizing public and critical support for regionally themed pictures of
                    middle-western <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"

                <p>The society that Steele helped organize was especially intent on increasing art
                    sales, and to that end its annual exhibition of the paintings, prints, and
                    ceramics of member artists traveled for six months each year to cities including

                    however, were never spectacular and over time many of the group&apos;s artists
                    turned to other cultural organizations and institutions for critical and
                    financial sustenance. Moreover, as the twentieth century progressed, the
                    society&apos;s Impressionist style of landscape painting was increasingly out of
                    sync with the new modes of modern art displayed at blockbuster events like the
                    1913 Armory show. Finally, in 1916, the artist group disbanded. Featuring
                    detailed information about the society&apos;s annual exhibition catalogs,
                    membership lists, exhibition venues, annual prize winners, and works exhibited
                    by Steele, Perry&apos;s book provides a much needed account of the aspirations
                    and achievements of this pioneering midwestern cultural institution.</p>

                    of the area. Yet, this is much more than a history about a newspaper; it also

                    would support the policies of President Abraham Lincoln,&quot; a risky
                    proposition since the Democratic Party held sway in <placeName><region

                    (freed or fugitive) should not reside in <placeName><region type="state"

                    Their views were reflected in the state&apos;s constitution, which in 1851
                    prohibited African Americans from settling in the Hoosier state.</p>
                <p>Jones and his partner, Republican attorney Isaac Jenkinson, faced competition
                    from other local newspapers that opposed abolitionism; indeed, the <hi rend="i"

                    after Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. Democrats
                    warned of a &quot;black wave&quot; of &quot;paupers, idlers, and thieves&quot;
                    swarming into <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"

                    the national conscription act that spring, that &quot;some state and national
                    officials&quot; worried about &quot;another rebellion and act of secession, with
                    portions of the Old Northwest&quot; leading the way, a course of action that was
                    at least tacitly justified by the <hi rend="i"> Fort Wayne Sentinel</hi> (p.

                    financial problems, technological advances, and competition from other papers.
                    The <hi rend="i">Journal Gazette</hi> remained staunchly Republican until the

                    took on the Ku Klux Klan. Indiana was the most powerful Realm in the Invisible
                    Empire, and most of the state&apos;s newspapers, as Bushnell notes, were either
                    sympathetic to or silent about the Klan&apos;s intolerance and racism. Not so
                    with the <hi rend="i">Journal Gazette</hi>, which sharply criticized the hooded

                <p>By the time of his North American expedition, Prince Maximilian had already
                    undertaken two voyages to the Americas; this time he was accompanied by Bodmer
                    and Wied hunter and taxidermist David Dreidoppel. Maximilian&apos;s wide-ranging
                    observations extend beyond the natural sciences and will captivate the reader.
                    From the group&apos;s Fourth of July landing in Boston in 1832 amidst
                    festivities and fear of cholera, to physical descriptions of urban life in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013445" reg="Boston"

                            >Philadelphia</settlement></placeName> juxtaposed with those of the
                    agrarian landscape, this is in many important ways a social history of the early
                    republic. Travel conditions, the strong German influence in <placeName><region
                            type="state" key="tgn_7007710" reg="Pennsylvania"
                        >Pennsylvania</region></placeName>, local rural customs and food culture,
                    and comparative farming practices all share the spotlight with Maximilian&apos;s
                    identification of the flora and fauna. Yet this is prelude to his eager
                    anticipation of studying Native Americans, which is covered in the remaining
                    volumes.</p>
                <p>Indianans might be particularly interested in the lengthy section on
                    Maximilian&apos;s stay in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014208"

                    His observations are a window into this <geogName key="tgn_2746502"

                    activities, as well as many of its local luminaries, such as

                    naturalist and illustrator Charles A. Lesueur, and Robert Owens&apos;s family.
                    Maximilian noted six hundred inhabitants, steamboat and flatboat activity, a
                    stage that came three times a week from <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    once a week. Perhaps of more interest than the classifications of local plant
                    and animal species are the largely negative characterizations of the local farm
                    people and their farming practices. He describes their appearance and manners in
                    terms like &quot;dirty,&quot; &quot;crude,&quot; &quot;shabby,&quot; and
                    &quot;very bad&quot; (p. 235). He was even less impressed with what he believed
                    was negligent care of livestock, a primitive interest in cattle breeding, and a
                    crippling focus on raising Indian corn and hogs which foraged everywhere.
                    Nevertheless a great deal about early nineteenth-century southern Indiana life
                    can be gleaned from this volume.</p>
                <p>In its presentation and remarkable detail, this volume represents the best of
                    scholarly publications. Yet it also exemplifies what can go wrong when too much
                    attention is paid to <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-106-2-090"/> aesthetics and not
                    enough to the vital areas of copyediting and proofing. There is great
                    inconsistency in the formatting of each chapter&apos;s chronology-including a
                    glaring error at thefront of chapter four noting the year as 1833, when it is in
                    fact 1832. Thepotential problems arising from research based upon this volume
                    areobvious.</p>

                    its line (p. 356).</p>
                <p>This story is told in great, sometimes even excessive detail, by various
                    qualified historians, preservationists, civic leaders, and canal enthusiasts,
                    all (with possibly one exception) happily self-confessed carriers of a
                    contagion-canal fever. That exception would be railroad historian H. Roger

                        >Erie Canal</geogName>, the Ohio waterway, constructed between 1825 and
                    1832, helped transform the state&apos;s economy into the 1850s and beyond. This
                    story is told by national park historian Sam Tamburro and photojournalist Frank
                    Gieck, and is buttressed by a new translation of the wonderful account by German
                    explorer and naturalist Prince Maximilian of Wied, of his trip along the entire
                    length of the canal in 1834. Other chapters on early canal history include
                    outstanding sections on the people who actually built the waterway, mainly Irish
                    immigrants, but also some local farmers and convicts. In addition, this book
                    contains excellent descriptions of technical matters, such as puddling, lock
                    construction and operation, surveying tools and procedures, and the importance
                    of water-resistant Portland cement.</p>
                <p>Another section reviews the canal&apos;s years of neglect and decline, the
                    devastating impact (in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706"
                            reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> and elsewhere) of enormous flood
                    waters in 1913, and the remarkable way a few visionaries kept the waterway from
                    complete abandonment. Among those who loved the canal and helped preserve its
                    memory and its existence were folklorist and songwriter Pearl Nye, who called
                    the canal he grew up along his &quot;Little Silver Ribbon&quot; (the title of
                    one of his many songs), and journalist Al Simpson, whose collected newspaper
                    columns were published in <hi rend="i">Along the Towpath: A Journalist
                        Rediscovers the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal</hi> (2003), and who earlier helped

                    to seek legislation preserving this invaluable property.</p>
                <p>Lastly, in a section as much hortative as historical, the editors are major
                    contributors to chapters that explain how the waterway became a canalway, which
                    is now part of the national park system, and what its presence as a nature
                    preserve, historical site, trail (for hiking, biking, and riding), and community
                    resource means to current and future generations of Ohioans and Americans.</p>

                <p>The importance of the hotel to understanding American cities and life is now
                    widely acknowledged. From their inception in the early nineteenth century,
                    hotels were not only emblems of the rise of urban centers, they were essential
                    instruments in making urban growth a reality. Beyond accommodating the fast
                    increasing number of travelers, early hotels were important gathering places for
                    the local elite. The progress and potential of a community were judged to a
                    significant degree by the extent and character of its hostelries. Major cities
                    set the standard, the emulation of which became a ubiquitous phenomenon in
                    smaller cities and towns nationwide. Hotels also served as catalysts to
                    stimulate city building in communities where settlement was in its infancy. Ever
                    bigger and better hotels remained central definers of downtown
                            <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                            >America</country></placeName> into the mid-twentieth century.</p>
                <p>Despite its historical value, the hotel has attracted less scholarly attention
                    than it deserves. The horizon has been substantially expanded by some recent
                    work, including A. K. Sandoval-Strausz&apos;s path-breaking cultural survey, <hi
                        rend="i">Hotel: An American History</hi> (2007). His and the few other key
                    studies have focused on work in the metropolis. John Jakle and Keith Sculle, on
                    the other hand, explore new territory by addressing developments in smaller
                    communities during the first half of the twentieth century. Drawing from an
                    array of period sources, the authors have organized the text in six chapters:
                    physical attributes, development, management, clientele, dining and drinking
                    facilities, and modernization. The content affords a solid introductory
                    perspective. For those examining the history of hotels or the morphology of
                    small cities and towns in the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"
                            reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName> during the twentieth
                    century, <hi rend="i">America&apos;s Main Street Hotels</hi> will be a useful
                    reference indeed. And because such hostelries remain threatened in many
                    communities, as the authors emphasize in the epilogue, the book should boost
                    efforts to preserve the many remaining examples.</p>
                <p>For all its virtues, Jakle and Sculle&apos;s volume skirts some basic issues.
                    What do mainstream examples tell us that those in major cities do not? If
                    &quot;Main Street&quot; hotels of the twentieth century were fashioned after
                    their big-city cousins, did they differ in significant ways? And how do early
                    twentieth-century examples differ from their forebears? The authors minimize
                    physical change over time, when the evidence they offer suggests that cumulative
                    change was substantial in planning and amenities. Despite the book&apos;s <pb
                        n="205" id="VAA4025-106-2-093"/> subtitle, very little of its content
                    addresses factors pertaining to automobile travelers until the final chapter,
                    and then the treatment is sporadic. Little fieldwork appears to have been done
                    in the course of this project. Had the authors been more ambitious in this realm
                    they might have uncovered examples such at the Hotel Wareham in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013992" reg="Manhattan"
                            >Manhattan</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state"

                    in response to the designation of the town&apos;s main street as U.S. 40. The
                    Wareham boasted a two-story, full-service garage (topped by a ballroom!) as a
                    rear annex as well as its own filling station and car lot. Or perhaps the Pierce
                    Pennant Motor Inn (1929) near <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    underground garage and landscaped grounds-as if a resort. Or, the Hotel Stafford
                    (1931-32) along U.S. 1 on the northern edge of <placeName><settlement

                    a fine resort. Fieldwork might also have underscored the stunning variety of
                    design treatments given to downtown hostelries in the 1920s and revealed some of
                    the new hotels-from <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2036538"

                    the door to a subject that demands our further attention.</p>

                    authors discuss at length the central role of the Hillel organization, begun in
                    1938, for the university and for the larger Jewish community. History from the
                    1950s onward covers the discrimination and lack of accommodation through the
                    1950s and 1960s; the first local minyan begun in 1964; the Jewish Community
                    Center begun in 1970 and its transition to a synagogue in the 1980s; the 1983
                    arson fire of the center later traced to two white supremacists; and the history
                    of the rebuilt Congregation Beth Shalom up to the present day. The book is
                    generously illustrated, and anyone interested in the history of the city and

                    importance of the state&apos;s second constitution, which pointed to the growing

                    change their constitutions to better reflect the growing democratization in
                    American society and politics&quot; (p. v). Carmony&apos;s thesis provides eight
                    chapters of analysis, including the issues that led up to the convention; the
                    political, social, and economic changes brought about by the new constitution;
                    and public reaction to the document. The thesis concludes with five appendices
                    of primary source material, including the 1851 document and later comments by
                    several convention delegates. The editors have added an up-to-date list of

                <p>In this young-adult novel, O&apos;Maley weaves fiction and truth to educate
                    readers on Indiana&apos;s part in the Underground Railroad. Through the young

                    Brickyard 400 will love this coffee-table book issued for the centennial of the
                    Motor Speedway. Although photographs predominate, many reproduced here for the
                    first time, fascinating text runs through every chapter. The book begins with
                    the first race in 1909-a motorcycle race-and then moves into the eight-abreast
                    first car race in the same year. There are photographs of the paving process
                    that turned the track into the Brickyard, and of a 1911 &quot;Reservation
                    Chart&quot; that lists the one dollar admission charge along with ticket prices
                    ranging from fifty cents to four dollars. There are photographs of drivers, car
                    owners and track owners, races and wrecks, pit areas, spectators and stands and
                    infields, and festival parades. Most of the book is devoted to the Indianapolis
                    500 but two final sections also cover the NASCAR Brickyard 400 and the U.S.
                    Grand Prix race.</p>

                    gives the reader a glimpse of the early lives of Richman and Shake, the bulk of
                    the story focuses on the years following World War II. By 1947, both justices
                    had retired from the higher court and begun to settle into civilian life when
                    they were called upon to serve as judges in the crimes against humanity trials
                    of leading German industrialists, Friedrich Flick <hi rend="i">et al</hi> of
                    Flick KG and Carl Krauch <hi rend="i">et al</hi> of IG Farben. The impact of
                    these Hoosier justices, who judged the defendants with American fairness, will
                    continue to resonate through time.</p>

                <p>The names David Ross and George Ade will certainly strike a bell for the students
                    and alumni of Purdue University. For some, that bell may only recall the
                    memories of a stadium and football season, for others it brings to mind two men
                    who dedicated their lives and fortunes to their beloved alma mater. In another
                    installment of Purdue University Press&apos;s Founders Series, Ade and

                <p>Scholars who study the religious revivals that swept the American frontier at the
                    beginning of the nineteenth century have conducted some studies of the &quot;new
                    repertory of folk hymnody&quot; (p. ix) which emerged at the time, but this book
                    should convince them that their studies are incomplete without a consideration
                    of early Shaker hymnody in general, and the first published Shaker hymnal, the
                    1813 <hi rend="i">Millennial Praises</hi>, in particular. In excellent
                    introductory essays, the editors discuss the role of music and dance in early
                    eastern Shaker development, the rise of the hymn tradition in the younger
                    western Shaker communities, and hymn texts as a source of early Shaker theology.
                    The final essay reveals how the texts (which were printed by themselves in the
                    original hymnal) were paired with the tunes (often more than one to each text)
                    that appear in this volume. Anyone interested in the musical history of early

                <p>At the age of twenty one, Edwin L. Lybarger was mustered into the Forty-Third
                    Ohio Infantry during the Civil War. Like many soldiers, he received letters from
                    home; however, the letters he wrapped in a ribbon and kept in the attic the rest
                    of his life were not from his family, as one might expect, but from a number of
                    young ladies. At its basic level, the collection of 168 letters published in
                    this volume shines light on the indispensable role letter writing played during
                    the Civil War. Fortunately for those interested in civilian life during this
                    period, the editors have provided us with a much richer analysis, from the roles
                    these letters played in war to the insight they provide of changing social
                    culture. In their introductory essay, the editors argue that young women&apos;s
                    letters to soldiers helped to relieve the &quot;burden of camp life and terror
                    of battle&quot; (p. xv), give the men higher status among their peers, and
                    connect the men with a life beyond the battlefield. While letters illustrated
                    the growing pains of young women faced with an uncertain adulthood, they also
                    served to highlight larger contextual issues and themes, such as &quot;shifts in
                    women&apos;s access to and engagement with education, and events on the
                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio"

                    pleased with the extensive secondary and primary research that supports this
                    highly readable volume.</p>

                <p>David Work sets out to examine the success of Abraham Lincoln&apos;s appointment
                    of political generals-men who represented their political party and important
                    constituencies, some with military experience, but none a graduate of West Point
                    or a career officer-throughout the Union Army. Lincoln deliberately chose men
                    from both major parties and from various ethnicities (in particular, German and
                    Irish). The author takes a sample of sixteen men-eight Democrats and eight
                    Republicans <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-106-2-101"/> from different regions of the
                    nationand follows them through the war, taking &quot;into account all of their
                    activities&quot; (pp. 3-4) in the administration of the war as well as in
                    battle. Four midwestern generals-<placeName><region type="state"

                    Republican Stephen Hurlbut; and Ohio Republican Robert Schenck-are among the
                    sixteen in this study. Based upon all of his evidence, Work concludes that,
                    although few of his subjects distinguished themselves as battlefield commanders,
                    most of the political generals &quot;provided capable and necessary
                    service&quot; which &quot;more than justified&quot; Lincoln&apos;s policy (p.

                <p>Most works devoted to the development of our nation during the nineteenth century
                    have concentrated on the geographic movement that expanded our borders westward.
                    In this compelling work, Thomas M. Allen argues that spatial transformation was
                    less important in the imagining of <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"
                            reg="United States">America</country></placeName> by its people than the
                    perception of time. By examining artifacts such as clocks, paintings,
                    literature, and scientific treatises, Allen contends that time was imagined in
                    three ways: a technological &quot;clock time&quot; that drove the newly
                    industrialized culture; a geological &quot;deep time&quot; that accompanied the
                    shift from biblical chronology to a much longer natural history supported by
                    Darwin and other scientists; and finally, romantic historical time that ushered
                    in the nineteenth century. This shift in thinking opens the reader to envision
                    more complex, and at times competing, ideas of what nationhood meant to
                    Americans during this period.</p>

                <p>Retired Army officer and history professor Mark A. Snell has edited this
                    intriguing volume of essays dedicated to the memory and remembrance of Gen. John
                    Pershing&apos;s American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) from World War I. Divided
                    into three sections, the book first examines how Americans have remembered,
                    commemorated, and interpreted the battles and soldiers that were part of the
                    AEF&apos;s history. The second section focuses more on the soldiers&apos; own
                    experiences and the evolution of myths and legends created by post-war memories.
                    The last section explores the ways in which the AEF has been remembered in
                    popular culture. Snell&apos;s own chapter &quot;The Price was Made and the Price
                    was Paid&quot; highlights controversial and bitter moments in the construction
                    of memorials around the nation. One particularly harsh example was the funding
                    of the Indiana War Memorial Plaza, first created to memorialize veterans of the
                    Great War. However, the &quot;<placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
