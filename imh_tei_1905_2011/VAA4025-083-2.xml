            <p>Studies of the settlement movement have tended to be of the snapshot variety, portraits of the
                    movement in the full flower of enthusiasm of the 1890s when the settlement house embodied a
                    generation's hopes for the cooperative transformation of society. While the contributions
                    of the settlements to progressive reform have been well documented, the connections between the
                    settlement movement and the emerging institutions of professional social work in the twentieth
                    century remain largely unexplored. The history of Christamore, a college settlement in <placeName>

                    women reformers to come together and build the institutions which became the prototypes for
                    twentieth-century social work. This paper will begin by examining some of the common conditions that
                    led to the founding of settlements in dozens of American cities in the early years of this century,
                    and then it will describe Christamore's evolution from a religiously motivated institution
                    of community re-form to a social agency staffed by professionals engaged in community service.</p>
            <p>Jane Addams did not originate the idea of a college settlement, but more than anyone else Addams
                    provided a generation of college-educated, single women with the vocabulary of obligation and
                    philosophy of action which explained and justified the new institutions. Two essays by Jane Addams,
                    "The Subjective Necessity for Social Settlements" (1892) and "The College
                    Woman and the Family Claim" (1898), analyze the impulse behind the settlement movement.
                    Addams suggested in these essays that settlements were as important in meeting the emotional and
                    intellectual needs of the settlement workers as in providing the material wants of the poor, the
                    settlements' clients. "There is a heritage of noble obligation which young people
                    accept and long to perpetuate," she wrote. "The desire for action, the wish to
                    right wrongs and alleviate suffering haunts them daily."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Men could
                    follow the call to service in many fields—in the ministry, the professions, or business.
                    Women, however, were thwarted when they tried to pursue these ideals; schooled in the seriousness of
                    duty and service, they emerged from college to find themselves bound by the "family
                    claim." Their talents, their altruism, must be exercised only within the family. The result
                    was a sense of uselessness and unhappiness. "To shut oneself away from that half of the
                    race life is to shut oneself away from the most vital part of it; it is to live out but half the
                    humanity to which we have been born heir and to use but half our faculties.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>When Addams described the force behind the settlement movement as women's sense of
                    obligation combined with a desire to put theory into action, she identified an acute crisis among
                    college women of her time: in an age which worshipped activity, mobility, and self-improvement,
                    women were defined as passive, constant, and self-sacrificing—the mirror image of the
                    qualities characteristic of exuberant capitalism.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> True, one barrier had fallen
                    when women had been admitted to higher education, but the new female graduates emerged from college
                    with a conviction that they had a special contribution to make to society only to come up against a
                    brick wall of convention. The result was often psychological and even physical illness such as Jane
                    Addams herself suffered for eight years between her graduation and the founding of Hull House in
                        1889.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No development better illustrates this conflict and its resolution than the founding in 1890 of the
                    College Settlement Association by a group of alumnae of eastern schools, especially Wellesley,
                    Vassar, and Smith. In language very similar to that of Jane Addams, the association promoted college
                    settlements as institutions that would fill the special needs of female college graduates and save
                    them from morbid thoughts and wasted lives. "Here could be focused all that desire for
                    philanthropic work which exists in a marked degree among us, and, for lack of proper outlet, is
                    largely self consuming," declared the founders of the College Settlement Association in
                    February, 1889. "Here could come the young graduate, fresh from the class room of
                    economics, to supplement by a year of actual experience and practical training, the theoretical work
                    of the college."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The advocates of college settlements asserted that
                    college women were fitted for settlement work both through <list type="footnotes">

                            experience. Vicinus argues that a "passion for meaningful work" was the
                            "sacred center of nineteenth-century single women's lives and communities.

                    because they combined the homely atmosphere of a small college dormitory with high intellectual and
                    moral purpose. Moreover, settlements expanded the experience of the residents while assuring them
                    the respectability of a collective, feminine institution that resembled a college residence hall.
                    One resident even referred to the settlement house as a "graduate school in

                    however. For settlement work differed from other forms of philanthropic work by requiring those who
                    wanted to help the poor to live among them. It was a revolutionary idea for its time, but one with

                    </placeName> settlement workers Anna Stover and Edith Surbey replicated Jane Addams's
                    experience. Like Addams, Anna Stover passed through the frustration of inactivity, mental
                    depression, physical illness, and even breakdown to arrive at the "creative
                    solution" of a moral reform institution that combined intellectual endeavor with strenuous
                    action and created an atmosphere of strong feminine companionship.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Life in a
                    settlement house enabled young women like Surbey and Stover to put their religious principles into
                    action and to move out into the public sphere in a way that departed radically from the confined
                    lives of their mothers and grandmothers.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Anna Stover was born in 1870 in the small central Indiana town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ladoga</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Her father was a successful and important man. He was a lawyer, businessman, and
                    member of the Indiana legislature. But religion, not worldly success, ruled the Stover house-hold.
                    The Stovers were "Campbellites," members of the Disciples of Christ denomination.
                    Anna's father was president of the Indiana State Christian Ministerial Association and a

                    </placeName>, a Disciples denominational school. Anna's two half-brothers were preachers in
                    the Christian church, and her sister married a preacher.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anna Stover trained as a kindergarten teacher and for a while taught in her home town of <placeName>

                    Looking back on this illness later in life, Anna Stover was convinced that it had marked a turning
                    point in her life. Lying delirious and near death, she had had a vision of her dead sister calling

                            frequently played the role of "mothers." But settlement workers were
                            "not mothers living in surrogate families," according to Vicinus. Instead,
                            she contends: "They were hard-working, ambitious, and visionary women setting forth
                            with great courage upon untrodden paths. But they were also intensely conflicted, deeply
                            emotional women, seeking to fulfill themselves in ways society would approve while still

                    </placeName> College. The two young women developed an intense friendship during their student days
                    despite their widely differing views on religion. While Stover was intensely religious, Surbey
                    described herself as a lapsed Catholic, and while Stover came from a pious family that was active in
                    their denomination, Surbey wrote that, "Religion in our family was a synonym for
                    hypocrisy." Their friendship lapsed as the two young women went their separate ways after
                    graduation in 1894. Stover went back to <placeName>

                            and Surbey's relationship became a sexual one or remained platonic. In her study of
                            nineteenth-century female relationships, Carroll Smith-Rosenberg wrote,
                            "Paradoxically to twentieth century minds, their love appears to have been both
                            sensual and platonic." Carroll Smith-Rosenberg, "The Female World of Love

                            all their sexual energy into municipal improvement and other reforms and lived in the
                            settlements like "Protestant nuns" is no longer accepted. The relationship
                            between Stover and Surbey perhaps paralleled the forty-year relationship between Jane Addams
                            and Mary Rozet Smith: they did not sublimate sexual passion in their work, but drew energy
                            for their work from their loving, supportive (and perhaps sensual) relationship. Blanche

            <p>The location of the house was influenced by the encouragement of the largest employer in the

                    rapidly. There were several white and a few black churches, and a public school, described by a
                    minister as "one of the smallest and oldest and most poorly equipped school buildings in
                    the city." The district's streets were all unpaved, and it was estimated that
                    there were between fifteen and twenty saloons.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>Housing conditions, though not crowded, left much to be de-sired. Only about 20 percent of the houses
                    were connected to the city water or sewer systems, and only 5 percent had indoor plumbing. The area
                    was predominantly one of renters, most of them re-cent arrivals. Unemployment and poverty plagued
                    black families the most, for the Atlas Engine Works employed only white men. But even for whites the
                    economic situation of the district became precarious when the Atlas Works began to reduce its work

                    a combination of practical help and spiritual uplift, they believed, "not only the outward

            <p>Historians have often regarded the settlement movement as a standard-bearer of racial equality in a
                    racist era, but a careful study of settlements such as Christamore cannot sustain this view.
                    Christamore's founders had no intention of extending the benefits of the settlement house
                    to their black neighbors; in fact, they interpreted the rather casual intermixing of blacks and
                    whites in the neighborhood as an indication of serious degeneracy. The settlement's mission
                    was to lift the white population to a "higher plane" and to draw the color line
                    more sharply. But by excluding the neighborhood's growing black population from
                    Christamore, the founders charted a policy which would put the very existence of the settlement
                    house in doubt within ten years.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Between 1905 and 1911 Stover and Surbey developed Christamore into a lively neighborhood center for
                    the area's white residents. At the same time (though they did not advertise this aspect)
                    Christamore was a practical demonstration of cooperative living for young single women. The
                    settlement attracted a variety of female residents who came and went, some staying only for a

                    "investigate and improve existing conditions, and to provide centers for a higher civic,
                    social and religious life." With the first money raised by the board, Stover and Surbey
                    printed leaflets for publicity and rented the cottage at 1918 Arsenal Avenue that became the
                    settlement's first home. Thus began a brief formal connection between the Christamore

            <p>Settlement residence sometimes led to investigation and re-form. In 1910 Indiana University students
                    resident at Christamore compiled data for Leander M. Campbell Adams's survey of housing and
                    living conditions under the direction of Professor Ulysses G. Weatherley.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Like

                    Christamore residents tried to get a complete statistical description of their neighborhood. Such
                    surveys were more than an academic exercise. This one, for instance, provided data for the campaign
                    for a state housing law, which passed two years later in 1913.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

            <p>This relationship between the universities and the settlement house, so quickly established, was soon

                    </placeName> that siphoned off many students who other-wise would have entered settlement work.
                    Students now did their practical work and their medical social research not at the settlement but
                    with the charity patients at the hospital and the city dispensary.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Christamore

                    who lived there. What was the nature of this impact? What did the settlement mean to the
                    neighborhood?</p>
            <p>With the motto, "Improvement is the aim, friendship the principle," Anna Stover and
                    Edith Surbey embarked on the first task for any new settlement house, winning acceptance in their
                    neighborho d. Neighborhood visiting and settlement club work were important to settlements because
                    of their content, of course, but they also served to establish everyday contact between settlement
                    workers and working-class neighbors that the settlements believed vital to their mission of breaking
                    down class barriers. Optimistic about the possibility of teaching their values to their poorer
                    neighbors, they also hoped for a return of face-to-face communication that would restore and
                    regenerate the whole society.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christamore's founders soon seized on the idea of a kindergarten for neighborhood children
                    as a practical, needed program that would be welcomed by working mothers. Throughout the nation
                    settlement workers began kindergartens because of their reforming potential for young children. The
                    fact that Stover and Surbey had been trained as teachers and that several of the first settlement
                    residents were kindergarten teachers also made this a natural choice.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> The
                    Christamore kindergarten was not an isolated effort but part of an established, publicly supported
                    kindergarten system in the city that dated back to the establishment of the Indianapolis Free
                    Kindergarten Association in 1882.50 In August, 1905, Anna Stover moved the settlement house to
                    larger quarters at 1908–1910 Columbia Avenue in order to accommodate the kindergarten,
                    which opened in September, 1905. The kindergarten's initial enrollment of 45 had risen to
                    135 by the following year.51 In Martha Stewart Carey, kindergarten director at the settlement from
                    1907 until her death in 1925, Christamore had a vigorous proponent of this branch of progressive
                    education. Her influence on <list type="footnotes">

            <p>An important part of Christamore's program consisted of club activities with young people.
                    Club work should be "broad, that is, religious, industrial, intellectual and
                    social," Anna Stover wrote.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> She established clubs for all age groups
                    of boys and girls: for the girls, the Jewel, Fidelity, Princess, and Loyalty clubs; for the boys,
                    the White Shield, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Young American clubs. Christamore's clubs were designed to produce
                    "real patriotism, a respect for and knowledge of self-government, and cultivation of the
                    spirit of usefulness," one sponsor noted.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Boys' programs presented problems for most settlement houses: boys could not be ignored,
                    yet, they were hard to control, and ideas of proper education for them dictated the use of a
                    gymnasium, which few settlement houses could afford. Boys' programs generally be-came
                    established only after a settlement had sufficient funds to build a gym and to employ male workers.
                    Wood carving classes were tried with the boys at Christamore, but even these proved too much for the
                    settlement worker in charge.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Housekeeping, rather than government or patriotism formed the theme of settlement work with girls.
                    The "formula" for their clubs was "alternately cooking and housekeeping
                    with devotional beginnings and social and game endings."<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Historians
                    influenced by the Hull House "model" have assumed that all settlements were
                    interested in preserving the cultural distinctiveness of their clients. The Christamore settlement
                    workers, however, assumed that household tasks would be done one way. They judged the homes of their
                    neighbors to be sadly lacking in hygiene, order, and regularity. It was up to the settlement workers
                    to teach these migrants from rural Indiana, <placeName>

                    heritage of these rural folk from the Upland South. Although Anna Stover confided to her
                    "Reminiscent History," "we began to create the sentiment in our
                    neighborhood that for all our learning, we were ‘just common and sociable

            <p>Some of the more famous settlement houses, such as Hull House, established model kitchens and
                    laundries as experiments in cooperative living in an attempt to reorganize the unpaid domestic work
                    that was women's responsibility in a more efficient way. But most settlements, like
                    Christamore, remained committed to the ideal of a single family home with a male breadwinner and a
                    "Progressive mother" despite the fact that the settlement house was itself a
                    living demonstration of a community of single females living cooperatively.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>

            <p>In order to teach the standards of home life they wanted their neighbors to adopt, Christamore
                    residents chose a demonstration method. Desired standards were displayed at elaborate entertainments
                    to which the whole neighborhood was invited. One such "entertainment" in 1907 was
                    entitled, "The Making of a Home" and featured many displays of domestic skills.

                    sweeping, and the Loyalties their prowess at making beds. "But the washing and ironing by
                    the Jewel Club [girls aged five to nine], with their tubs and suds and their earnest endeavor, was
                    counted the cleverest of all," Anna Stover fondly recalled.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such entertainments enabled the Christamore settlement workers to attract neighborhood women to
                    settlement clubs and classes. After a discouraging beginning when the first recruits to the Friendly
                    Neighbors Club seemed to Anna Stover to be "back-ward and silent," the group began
                    to be a success. By 1907 meetings of the club were attracting an average attendance of twenty-five.
                    By putting neighborhood women in charge of clothing sales to others in need, the settlement workers
                    tried to involve them in some responsibility at the settlement.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

                    quality. Poor distribution practices meant that milk was often spoiled or dirty when it reached city
                    consumers. The result was a high summer seasonal death rate, especially for children and infants.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> The Pure Milk Program was set up under the auspices of the
                    Children's Aid Association in cooperation with the city board of health, the Kindergarten
                    Association, and the Commercial Club. It was funded by public subscriptions and receipts from the
                    sale of milk.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Organized in a manner similar to programs already launched in
                    twenty other cities, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pure Milk Program provided for the distribution of milk made safe by pasteurization at
                    a modern dairy. The provision that five nurses and six physicians should be in attendance at the
                    distribution stations to examine the babies who were brought there was an important advance for
                    preventive health care. Indeed, the scheme was a great success. By one estimate, in a single year
                    the program had lowered by one-half the seasonal mortality for children under five.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>

            <p>The selection of Christamore as one of five "pure milk stations" strengthened the
                    settlement's position as a community center. There were now opportunities to make contacts
                    with neighborhood people since babies were weighed and information was given to mothers during their
                    visits to the station. In 1911 the work was expanded when a trained nurse was employed at the
                    settlement to make home visits. Alice Menser, the nurse, was soon making an estimated one hundred
                    calls a week. She did not confine her attention to sickness, according to a settlement report, but
                    also made the most of her <list type="footnotes">

            <p>As the settlement's activities multiplied, the settlement workers began to feel hampered by
                    the lack of space. Consequently, plans were made to build a new settlement house on two lots at 1806

                    </placeName> Avenue Stover had purchased in 1907 for $1,000. She had raised the money by
                    asking each board member for $100, and collecting "almost $300,
                    mostly in pennies," from the neighborhood.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> A building campaign began
                    in earnest early in 1909; funds were collected from well-wishers, and an architect donated his
                    services. Construction was completed in August, 1909, and in October, 1909, Christamore's
                    residents moved into the new building. On the ground floor were the office of the headworker, large
                    rooms for clubs and classes, a sizable hall for the kindergarten, and a gymnasium large enough for
                    basketball games. On the second floor were the apartments of the head worker and a woman assist-ant
                    director and more rooms for meetings. Baths for men and women adjoined the gymnasium. "In
                    appearance and attractiveness the settlement serves as a model for the neighborhood," a
                    1918 report declared. "The neighborhood cannot help [but] be better because of the presence
                    of the house."<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the move into Christamore's new facilities, disagreement over the goals, purposes, and
                    programs of the settlement arose between its founders and its board. With the resolution of these
                    disagreements, the settlement house embarked on a new period of maturity, but it did so without the
                    two women who had founded it. As Christamore's activitives expanded, the problem of
                    defining the ultimate goals of the settlement house became more acute. For Anna Stover and Edith
                    Surbey settlement work had been the expression of an inner faith. They had scrubbed floors,
                    importuned businessmen for contributions, ventured down unsavory alleys, all for the sake of an
                    ideal which promised the material and spiritual redemption of their neighborhood—and
                    perhaps of themselves as well. Christamore's emphasis had been on evangelical
                    Protestantism; its social service work had always been embedded in a missionary purpose. Now the
                    settlement board was urging Stover and Surbey to make the settlement more of a recreation center and
                    to phase <list type="footnotes">

                    founders could not accept. Their resignation in 1911 was almost certainly caused by this
                    disagreement over philosophy rather than, as they claimed, by ill-health.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>

            <p>After their resignation Christamore completed the transition from religious settlement house to
                    social center. At the same time, the settlement took an important step toward professionalization
                    when it entered the National Federation of Settlements as a charter member in 1911.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> As a member house, Christamore was required to de-emphasize religious observance and to

            <p>The settlement reports for 1911 and 1912 show that Christamore was flourishing. With eleven resident
                    workers and seventy-five nonresident and volunteer workers, the house was a hive of activity where
                    about six hundred people attended settlement activities each week. The settlement not only provided
                    educational opportunities to many who would not otherwise have had them, it also supplemented the
                    physical resources of its neighbors; for ex-ample, the Christamore baths were in constant use, for
                    only 5 per-cent of the district's houses had indoor plumbing.<hi rend="sup">73</hi>

                    Canon Barnett to Jane Addams, the Christamore leadership reaffirmed their goals for the nation using
                    the words of Jane Ad-dams, "The best result of civilization … must be
                    incorporated into our common life and have free mobility through all elements of society if we would
                    have our democracy endure."<hi rend="sup">76</hi>

            <p>Yet this vision of progress was for whites only. Christamore had been founded to serve the white
                    residents of the surrounding neighborhood, but by 1910 blacks made up half the population of the
                    Christamore district. The black ghetto of the Indiana Avenue district was beginning to spread
                    eastward as its population was swelled by blacks from the South seeking opportunity. Between 1910
                    and 1920 the black population of the city as a whole doubled from 15,931 to 34,678.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> As the racial composition of its neighbor- <list type="footnotes">

                    attendance; white attendance at the settlement house fell from four thousand a month in 1913 to only

            <p>Thus, when Edwards came to take the position of head resident in August, 1915, she almost immediately
                    faced a crisis which threatened to close down the settlement house permanently. For months,
                    Christamore's board and new director deliberated. Should they set up a separate branch
                    settlement for blacks as some other settlements were doing; admit them to the main building on
                    certain days; or continue to exclude them and face declining attendance?<hi rend="sup">79</hi> The
                    decision of Christamore's sponsors to move the settlement house rather than integrate it
                    may seem surprising in view of the well-known commitment of settlement leaders such as Jane Addams
                    to racial justice. This move was not untypical, how-ever: as the new institutions of social work
                    emerged in the post-World War I period, they were generally segregated. Only later, when whites had
                    fled inner-city areas where they were located, would settlements open their doors to blacks.<hi rend="sup">80</hi>

            <p>Christamore was endowed with a splendid new building, challenged by a new neighborhood, and
                    recognized by the patron saint of the settlement movement. However, new developments in the field of
                    social work in the 1920s—the tendency for voluntary social welfare agencies to join in
                    federations and to develop closer and more formal relationships with business—presented
                    settlements with such a changed climate in which to work as to alter the nature of the movement.<hi rend="sup">84</hi>

                    Christamore's Olive Edwards represented a new type of settlement worker, one who expected
                    settlements to take their place within the emerging bureaucratic structures of social work. A

            <p>Under Edwards's leadership Christamore completed the transition from private voluntary
                    agency to member agency of a city-wide federation supported by the Community Chest. In 1917 the
                    settlement still relied on private donors, raising 30 percent of its income from the Christamore Aid
                    Society and 27 percent from subscriptions. But after 1920, when it entered the Community Chest, its
                    source of support changed. By 1928, 94 percent of the settlement's funding came through the
                        Chest.<hi rend="sup">87</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to Edwards's credit that in a climate of increased professionalism and bureaucracy she
                    nevertheless sought to define the settlement's role in a new and more democratic way. In a
                    frank statement she disowned the settlement tradition of cultural uplift which was often
                    indistinguishable from <hi rend="i">noblesse oblige</hi>. Edwards tried to redefine the mission of
                    the settlement house; Christamore would not be a "place where the rich come to patronize
                    those less well off," nor would its sponsors "offend the people of Haughville with
                    the suggestion that it is a charitable institution, or a school set there to educate
                        them."<hi rend="sup">88</hi> This new, more democratic emphasis led to the
                    encouragement of community organization in the Christamore neighborhood. The Civic League of
                    Haughville, which met at Christamore during the 1920s, was successful in putting pressure on
                    municipal authorities to improve street paving and lighting and to provide playgrounds in the
                        district.<hi rend="sup">89</hi> And on the eve of the Depression the Christamore board was
                    contemplating the creation of a council of neighborhood people that would have a direct role in the
                    running of the settlement. Unfortunately this proposal to enlarge the base of the
                    settlement's support was shelved as the agency turned its full attention to meeting the
                    relief emergency.<hi rend="sup">90</hi>

                    living among those groups and thereby incorporate them into a community of consumption. As a
                    settlement report of 1925 neatly put it, the objective was "to foster an understanding of
                    American institutions and a desire for the good things in life in the hearts and minds of most of
                    the 15,000 people of Haughville." The result was to be a society undifferentiated by class
                    or ethnic (but not racial) divisions.<hi rend="sup">91</hi>

            <p>Haughville presented a challenge to the settlement different from any it had faced so
                    far—an ethnically mixed population of new immigrants, mostly East Europeans, and an older
                    population of Irish and Germans. With its move to Haughville, Christamore joined the Americanization
                    crusade in which settlements all over the country were engaged.<hi rend="sup">92</hi> The

                    city's progress towards a progressive future—with calls for patriotism. Using an

                        argued that in the early twentieth century ethnic and even working-class
                        "subcultures" organized around the family and the community and enjoyed some
                        independence from the hegemonic, dominant culture. Zunz believes that these separate,
                        self-reliant cultures began to yield in the 1920s to the mass society. With the important
                        exception of blacks, who experienced the opposite development of a solidifying ghetto, the
                        various subcultures were absorbed into the undifferentiated mass society. The
                        settlements' Americanization work aided this process of absorption. John E. Bodnar,

            <p>The settlement's image in the 1920s was both benevolent and respectable, a far cry from the
                    bohemian and collectivist flavor of the settlement movement of the 1890s. Christamore was
                    "an isle of happiness, surmounted by the Stars and Stripes," one writer
                        declared.<hi rend="sup">94</hi> Christamore's programs reflected a philosophy
                    fundamentally in agreement with the way society was organized. The settlement did not promote
                    fundamental reform, nor was it an agency seeking to redistribute the economic goods of society;
                    in-stead, the settlement's task was to equip people to compete more effectively within the
                    economy, to encourage them in certain standards of health, manners, and morals, to promote self-help
                    solutions, and to advocate an ethic of individual upward mobility.</p>
            <p>Christamore's success in the 1920s cannot be attributed to its effectiveness as an agency of
                    social reform. Its success came about because of a congruence between the goals of the settlement
                    and those of elite groups within the society. That businessmen were able to support an agency which
                    helped the poor to help themselves and provided essential services on a basis of voluntary giving is
                    shown by the support which it received from the Community Fund. This amounted to $13,251
                    in 1928 out of Christamore's total revenues of $14,043.<hi rend="sup">95</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the community's support of Christamore was not only financial. An important supplement
                    to the regular staff was the Christamore Aid Association, whose seventy members provided volunteer
                    assistance in many of the settlement's activities. The new profession of social work
                    retained a place, lowly but essential, for the untrained female volunteer.<hi rend="sup">96</hi>
                    Support also came from the users of the settlement, for whether or not working-class people accepted
                    its values, they were indeed making use of Christamore, as attendance figures show. During 1924
                    average daily attendance was 134, and the total attendance during the year was 41,136. By 1928 total
                    annual attendance had risen to over 53,000: by 1931, to 70,769.<hi rend="sup">97</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was Christamore a success as it entered the thirties? In one way it is impossible to say. After all,
                    settlement leaders had de-fined the settlement in such a way that they were bound to measure
                    progress by the diminishing number of things that settlements <list type="footnotes">

                    At the same time, the 1920s saw rising standards of living for the better-paid working-class family,
                    which meant that there was less need for the settlements' social housekeeping role.<hi rend="sup">99</hi>

            <p>By 1930 Christamore had made the transition from private dream to semipublic agency. Anna Stover and
                    Edith Surbey had been the pioneers. Missionaries on an "urban frontier" (in
                    settlement leader Graham Taylor's phrase), they had endured present discomforts because
                    they had their eyes on the coming Kingdom of Heaven. Daring, determined, idealistic young women,
                    they represented a generation whose vision produced the institutions of social welfare and put in
                    place the infrastructure of social work for the next generation. But the postwar federations of
                    voluntary and public agencies had little place for spontaneity or individualism. In an age
                    symbolized by the flapper, the progressive "social mother" looked quaintly
                        archaic.<hi rend="sup">100</hi> Extravagant hopes were out of fashion; the new age required
                    social work, not social action.</p>
            <p>Developments at Christamore reflected a national trend. While the postwar reorganization of charities
                    strengthened settlements financially by bringing joint fund raising as well as coordinated services,
                    it also reduced their independence. A study of the settlement movement during the Depression shows
                    the result of settlements taking the friendly hand of business: in many cases the grasp had
                    tightened until it strangled what remained of independence and activism in the movement.<hi rend="sup">101</hi>

                    of the Intercollegiate Community Service Association, successor to the College Settlements
                    Association. In a report to this body in 1922 social worker Elizabeth Kemper Adams complained that
                    female undergraduates no longer realized the unique role or history of the college settlements. The
                    expectation of rapid, dramatic change was no longer there. Idealistic women—and, heaven
                    knows, there were few of them to be found—busied themselves with "community

                    agencies signaling by their acceptance of the financial support of business that their agenda of
                    reform was no longer incompatible with business goals or a threat to the existing economic order.</p>

            <p>The British employment of Indians during the Revolutionary War has consistently been called to notice
                    and condemned by that conflict's contemporaries and its later chroniclers. Historians of
                    the American Revolution on the frontier have closely examined the attitudes and actions of the
                    British officials at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Quebec, and sundry western outposts who were responsible for initiating and directing
                    bloody Indian raids against colonial backcountry settlements from 1777 through 1782. They have also
                    taken pains to identify the few British officials who purportedly opposed or deprecated the
                    crown's use of "savage" Indians in its war effort. Among those so honored
                    for their "humanity" is Edward Abbott, lieutenant governor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Abbott is repeatedly held up as an ex-ample of a compassionate and farsighted official
                    who futilely warned his superiors that the crown's adoption of the Indians'
                    barbarous methods of warfare would ultimately prove detrimental to the royal cause.</p>

                    </placeName>. Relying upon a few British documents, Consul W. Butterfield wrote in his history of
                    Clark's conquests (1904) that Abbott's limited presents of warlike stores helped
                    the warriors carry on "their murderous visitations" of frontier settlements. He
                    also stressed, however, that Abbott did not directly encourage "the savages" to
                    make war and that he "deplored the marauds." About three decades later
                    Abbott's reputation gained a substantial boost from three prominent western historians.
                    That not all British officials favored ruthless Indian forays was pointed out with stated pleasure
                    by James A. James in his biography of Clark (1928), by Louise P. Kellogg in an article on
                    Revolutionary-era Indian diplomacy (1929) and a major study of the British regime in the Midwest
                    (1935), and by Nelson V. Russell in an article about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Indian policy (1930). Each of them cited Abbott as having been innocent of
                    any "charges of inhumanity" because of his pleas to Quebec's governor,
                    General Sir Guy Carleton, to discontinue crown sponsorship of Indian raids. In two studies of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s policy published in 1951, John D. Barnhart again called attention to
                    Abbott's protest against the use of the Indians while relating his financial handicaps and
                    his onetime offer to raise warriors to fight the rebels. John Bakeless, in another standard Clark
                    biography (1957), stressed that Abbott lacked sufficient government-supplied merchandise to treaty
                    with the tribes effectively. In two important works on the Revolutionary frontier (1965 and 1967),
                    Jack M. So-sin once again singled out Abbott as a British official who "resisted taking the
                    offensive in the West and insisted on limiting the use of Indians." Most recently, in a
                    book (1976) and an article (1977) presenting overviews of the war in the west, George M. Waller
                    reinforced the portrait of Abbott as a steadfast opponent of the use of Indians as combatants,
                    contending, moreover, that the government sent him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> specifically "to enlist the warriors of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>," a task for which "he had little stomach." In the most

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Barnhart and Dorothy L. Riker explained in their history of colonial Indiana (1971)
                    that Abbott believed he could win over the <placeName>

                    stymied by financial restrictions. Yet, even they closed their discussion of Abbott by accentuating
                    his criticism of British Indian policy.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    Yet numerous other documents exist that allow a closer and more accurate view of Abbott's
                    transactions with the Indians. They reveal the exact state of British-Indian relations along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> during the one and one-half years before Clark's Virginians appeared at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and they explain precisely what triggered Abbott's oft-quoted outburst
                    against his government's Indian policy.</p>
            <p>Scrutiny of Abbott's Indian diplomacy will reveal that he undertook his assignment with a
                    complete willingness to use native warriors against the rebels. Yet, once he arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he neither offered the war hatchet to his district's Indians nor en-gaged
                    them to perform any other material services for the crown. This passivity arose not from scruples on
                    his part but rather from the pronounced Anglophobia of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> tribes, from the British ministry's failure to send him orders to rouse the
                    Indians to war, and from crippling financial restrictions placed on him by Governor Carleton. His
                    later condemnation of Indian raids came in response to an agent's report about a specific
                    incident south of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River. To an already frustrated Abbott this occurrence revealed at last the ultimate
                    futility of the contradictory dual manner in which he and Henry Hamilton had hoped to prosecute the
                    Revolutionary War in the Midwest, a region with whose complexities Abbott was quite familiar.</p>

                    </placeName>, Abbott began his lieutenant governorship possessing lengthy experience with the
                    Midwest, its Indians, and Indian warfare. When he received his appointment, he was an active-duty
                    artilleryman who had served for more than ten years at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he had established ties of family and friendship. Although Louise Kellogg long

                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, other writers have continued to repeat the misinformation that he "had no
                    Indian or border experience."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> In reality, Abbott was a career officer
                    of the blue-coated Royal Regiment of Artillery (R.R.A.). He had entered the Royal Military Academy
                    at Woolwich as a teenaged gentleman cadet in January, 1757, and graduated as a lieutenant-fireworker
                    two years later. By late 1762 he was serving as a junior officer with the detachment from the 1st

                    lieutanant in 1764 and to first lieutenant in 1769. He also married a local Canadien
                    (Franco-American) belle, Angelica Desrivieres, by whom he had one son in 1771 and at least one more
                    soon afterward. In addition to commanding the small artillery detachment, he acted for some time as <placeName>

                    and Canadien Indian traders and seems to have entertained thoughts about carving out a permanent
                    life on the American frontier. In 1773, how-ever, the 1st Battalion was relieved at
                    Britain's scattered American cantonments by detachments from the newly formed 4th
                    Battalion, and that July Abbott and his family sailed for <placeName>

                    in the interior. Once passed, this legislation (to take effect May 1, 1775) extended the borders of
                    Quebec Province to encompass former French-held territory south of the Great Lakes and north of the

                    his commission, however, the American Revolution had broken out, and he and his family were not able

            <p>Cautious and enigmatic, Carleton evidently hoped to overcome the American rebels with reconciliation
                    rather than retaliation, and he deliberately refrained from inflicting more military damage upon the
                    Americans than he considered necessary. In particular, he abhorred the thought of sending
                    Indians—whom he regarded as barbarous savages—against rebel settlers or even
                    rebel soliders in arms. Consequently, he had neglected to employ his Indian allies in the manner
                    most likely to have disrupted the rebel invasion in 1775. Likewise, in 1776 he refused to employ
                    against the battered rebel army on Lake Champlain the thousand or so Canadian and far western
                    warriors who assembled at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Montreal</settlement>
                    </placeName> during June and July. His scruples angered many of his subordinates, who could not
                    understand his apparent leniency toward the rebels and who believed that the crown's Indian
                    allies could have prevented the rebel invasion in 1775 and might yet complete the destruction of
                    Congress's northern army in 1776. Abbott, who already harbored resentment against Carleton
                    over the matter of his appointment, readily agreed with those who argued that the governor should
                    have sent Indian raiders against the Americans. In fact, he wrote to Dartmouth in September to give
                    his opinion that Carleton could have saved his province two prolonged campaigns if he had employed
                    Indian parties when the rebels had first probed <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s border in 1775. Shortly after this, Abbott at last set out for the interior

                        <settlement type="city">Montreal</settlement>
                    </placeName> Carleton gave him written instructions to govern his behavior at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although these are no longer extant, Abbott later noted that they contained nothing
                    "except the form of Office on all occasions"; that is, they out-lined a lieutenant
                    governor's responsibilities over his post's civil administration, fiscal accounts,
                    and fur trade as contained in Carleton's own instructions from the home government. Because
                    Carleton had not received any accurate intelligence about events in the Midwest for a year or more,
                    he could give Abbott no specific instructions regarding military activities, defensive posture, or
                    Indian affairs. He doubtless told Abbott in general terms to foster Indian friendship for the crown,
                    but he emphatically—though only verbally—forbade him "to incur any
                    Expence for the Indians of Post <placeName>

                    had appointed as acting commandant, on an allowance not to exceed £200 annually.
                    Subsequently, Carle-ton repeatedly attempted to eliminate all other government expenses for that

                    post to the next to buy furs. These Canadiens were friends and relatives of six strong and

                    agricultural center. About 1767 a passing British agent had tried to repair its old crumbling French
                    fort, but no British officer had ever been sent to assume command. Local officials handled all civil

                    not hesitate to waylay, kidnap, or kill any British traveler, trader, or soldier whom they happened
                    upon. One royal official noted that they had "been kept almost altogether in the dark with
                    respect to the power of the British nation." Throughout the 1770s the <placeName>

                    </placeName> tribes figure prominently in almost every rumored Indian plan to strike the British.
                    The hostility of these tribes continually threatened to interrupt navigation on the <placeName>

                    the southern tribes, particularly the Chickasaws and Cherokees. Every year numerous war parties of

                    </placeName> region had had the opposite result. During 1772–1773 an order for the

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> had provoked vociferous protests from the Canadien inhabitants and threats from the
                    Indians to kill Captain Lord's messengers. The order's revocation did little to
                    re-store goodwill toward the British. In 1771 the northern Indian superintendent had appointed
                    Alexis Loranger dit Maisonville, a Canadien trader long resident along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> confederacy. But Maisonville earned the enmity of the Miamis during a soap opera of
                    personal squabbles and commercial rivalries at Miamis Town in 1774, and he consequently lost his
                    influence with the tribes and hence his ability to further British interests. When Lord led <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1776, he held councils with the Indians at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Ouiatanon, and Miamis Town to negotiate a safe passage through their lands. Although
                    he succeeded in this, his speeches also informed the tribesmen that the last vestige of British
                    power was leaving the <placeName>

                    </placeName> spoke of "war on all sides," meaning hard feelings and violent
                    clashes between Indians and white traders. In the absence of any effective authority to regulate the
                    fur trade, unscrupulous dealings and abundant liquor led to an inordinate number of incidents
                    involving Canadien as well as British and Anglo-American traders. The task of convincing the haughty

                    favoring the despised British was sorely to test Abbott's assertion that a proper person

                    </placeName> on April 15, 1777, a week after he had greeted three <hi rend="i">Canadiens</hi> and

                    soon as possible that I might prevent the machinations of His Majesty's Enemies and if

                    Artillery would be-come effective while he was en route, he recognized that without troops he would
                    "be looked upon as a Cypher," and he therefore begged Carleton to send him a

            <p>Upon reaching Miamis Town on April 30, Abbott's company encountered a welcoming committee
                    comprised of Jean Marie Philippe Legras and twenty-four members of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> militia, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> interpreter Jean Baptiste Vaudry, the Piankashaw chief Tobacco's Son, and
                    thirty-six Indians representing each of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> valley tribes. When the Miamis from the surrounding villages joined the Indians already
                    assembled, Abbott found himself playing host to more than five hundred greedy tribesmen and
                    compelled to hire an additional interpreter, Fontenoy de Quindre. Abbott soon discovered that there
                    was "no end to the demands of the Indians." Although he tried to pass across the
                    portage to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> as quickly as possible, the necessary ceremonies and councils detained him for a week
                    and consumed a considerable amount of his merchandise and foodstuffs. He had to turn to resident
                    trader Charles Beaubien for an additional £490 worth of goods to satisfy the voracity of
                    a people who knew a royal official lacking troops had to substitute bribes for bayonets. From their
                    self-serving protestations of loyalty, however, Abbott concluded that "the greatest
                    Unanimity seems to reign between these Nations, in regard to his Majesty's
                        Interest."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Abbott's augmented party reached Ouiatanon on May 14, an even larger throng than had
                    collected at Miamis Town greeted him. He found the Kickapoos, Mascoutens, and Weas there
                    "so numerous and needy" that he "could not pass without great
                    expense." He had to acquiesce in their exorbitant demands, he admitted, because he had
                    "no troops and only a handful of French." Recognizing his weakness, these
                    tribesmen did not accord him as cordial a welcome as those at Miamis Town. At this point,
                    there-fore, Edgar advanced Abbott additional credit to settle the bills of Godefroy &amp;
                    Company (who had equipped passing couriers for six months) and to purchase more provisions and

                    orders encouraged him. After officially relieving Ste. Marie, he had Edgar settle the former acting

                    additional £2,593 worth of trade goods from James Cochran to provide a supply of Indian
                    presents. Next, Abbott organized the local militia into three companies of fifty men each and
                    selected as their commander Hypolite Beaulon, a merchant who traded with and interpreted for both

                    </placeName> and the Delawares of the <geogName>White River</geogName> seemed friendly enough, but
                    other tribesmen had told many of the <hi rend="i">Canadiens</hi> privately that the British official
                    "should not live long." Still unwilling to accept the intrusion of British
                    authority into their territory, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Indians, Abbott concluded, were "striving to sett [sic] the French [<hi rend="i">Canadiens</hi>] against the English government." Consequently, he sought to
                    protect himself by building a palisade around the cabin in which his family stayed and by asking
                    Rocheblave to send him some of the artillery standing idle at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>Abbott knew, however, that until a garrison arrived he could maintain the Indians'
                    friendship only by liberally dispensing merchandise to them. The journey from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example, had cost more than £7,500, all charged to his post's
                    Indian department ac-count. Therefore, he dared to ask Carleton to appoint a permanent commissary of

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and to recommend Ed-gar for the position. Even before the lieutenant governor reached

                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and immediately rushed off an angry letter to <placeName>

                    </placeName> informing him of the restrictions placed on Abbott's spending. He told <placeName>

                    council in late May with some <geogName>White River</geogName> Delawares and a number of the
                    Kickapoos, Mascoutens, and Potawatomis who had wintered along the upper <placeName>

                    well enough, but Rocheblave managed to persuade the Spanish-influenced Kickapoos, Mascoutens, and
                    Potawatomis only to refrain from constantly making war "upon the subjects of Great
                    Britain." The Delawares, conversely, appeared to him "to be attached to our
                    interests," and their headmen promised "to prevent the pas-sage of the colonists
                    in case of any attempt by their party upon this territory." When the <placeName>

                    Abbott. On June 1 he wrote to the lieutenant governor himself and offered to step aside if he would
                    transfer his headquarters to Fort Gage.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>Initially, Abbott viewed the situation a bit more confidently than did Rocheblave, but he soon came
                    to realize that he shared the latter's powerlessness to promote British interests
                    effectively. The military force at his disposal consisted only of Beaulon's militiamen, who
                    might or might not prove willing to defend their own village, and the two 3-pounders and two swivels
                    that Rocheblave sent to him under care of Paul Des Ruisseaux, a reliable Kaskaskian. Abbott placed
                    the cannon in Fort Sackville, as he called the ramshackle palisade around his cabin, a structure <placeName>

                    dispatched a few friendly Delawares "toward Fort Pitt to see what is doing

            </p>
            <p>Recognizing his exposed and weak military condition, Abbott now looked to the Indians to provide at
                    most defensive assistance. In fact, with many of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> tribesmen murmuring against him, the principal goal of his Indian diplomacy became the
                    reconciliation of the Indians to the presence of a British official at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Consequently, Abbott had to engage in negotiations with the Indians and, necessarily,
                    to continue expending government funds on Indian gifts. From June through August he drew an
                    additional £1,211 from several local merchants. In frequent meetings with visiting
                    tribesmen, he informed Carleton in August, "I have done to the best of my judgement to keep
                    the Indians of the Wabache (who are numerous) and the Delawares, in his Majesty's
                    interest." The response of the tribes of the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> proved speciously amiable, while the nearby Piankashaws were necessarily accommodating
                    and the <geogName>White River</geogName> Delawares surprisingly co-operative. The conferences with
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> chiefs bore the most substantial results. No doubt aided by Beaulon, Abbott confirmed
                    their promises to Rocheblave, including their pledge to warn him "should the Rebels or the
                    Spaniards attempt to come here." For the time being, he counted heavily on Indian support
                    to safeguard his district.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, when Rocheblave sent Abbott an alarming—but false—rumor about
                    impending war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> in mid-July, the latter en-gaged Des Ruisseaux not only to carry an urgent letter

                    he also provided their leaders with handbills (or placards) to post wherever they went. These
                    handbills (which Abbott also seems to have issued) offered safe conduct, humane treatment, military

                    </placeName>. Thus, he attempted to wage a contradictory, dual-natured campaign, using the stick of
                    rampaging warriors and the carrot of safe, free farmland to frighten and to lure frontierspeople
                    into joining the royal standard at <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Carleton had enclosed information copies for both Abbott and Rocheblave, but the

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> alone. Germain had nowhere given Abbott authority to instigate an Indian war, and
                    Carleton, who disapproved of Germain's course, was not compelled to permit Abbott or
                    Rocheblave the unchecked spending powers he had to grant <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>

                    Hamilton was unable to order Abbott to participate in the campaign because he had no authority over
                    his col-league at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Even if Abbott had been asked to engage the Indians, moreover, he learned from the
                    same dispatches that he would never be able to furnish the enormous amounts of gifts, equipment, and
                    munitions they would demand before condescending to help the British.</p>

                    Carleton's objections to his spending habits and had quoted the governor's vow
                    that in the future "none of His [Abbott's] Bills will be answered."
                    William Edgar, Abbott's principal creditor, had transmitted the same distressing news from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Despite these warnings, however, Abbott went on spending money for several weeks. He
                    did so, he informed Carleton, solely because of his zeal to secure the goodwill of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> tribes, but in reality he defied the governor because he thought he had more influence
                    with the Colonial Office than did Carleton. Late in Au-gust, however, he received a letter Carleton
                    had written on May 22 that told him in no uncertain terms to discontinue all expenditures. Faced
                    with certain financial ruin without government sup-port for his credit, Abbott tried after that to
                    eliminate all expenses for Indian affairs, except a salary for an interpreter. Pulling tight <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Before the arrival of Carleton's letter, Abbott had still clung to the hope that he would be
                    able to engage the tribes of his district in the king's service. At the time he learned of
                    the ministry's decision to enlist the Lakes and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> tribes in its 1777 campaign, he had felt confident that his and Des

                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> nations. When he realized that he was going to be left out of the year's
                    military operations, in fact, he wrote to Carleton on August 3 to assert that "at this time
                    [I] can have a thousand [warriors] at my Command to act wherever your Excellency may think
                    proper." Yet, in presuming that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> tribesmen might aid the British cause if Carleton financed their employment, Abbott-and <placeName>

                    </placeName>-badly misjudged the Indians' temper. Whatever platitudes the chiefs mouthed

                    but even these eventually returned without having struck a blow. During the absence of these
                    warriors, the Miamis "called the Head Men &amp; Capts. of their Nation"
                    together at Miamis Town to discuss the war belt. They knew that the Lakes Tribes and most of the <placeName>

                    afoul of both fiscal stringency and Indian intransigence. Deprived of their credit and excluded from
                    the ministry's general orders for the year's operations, Abbott and Rocheblave had
                    neither the authority nor the means to draw the neighboring Indians actively into the war, even
                    though each would have done so had he been able. Instead, they hoped at best to maintain the
                    tribesmen's reluctant toleration of the British officials in their country and to secure
                    their promises to oppose any other Euro-American intruders. Conversely, <placeName>

                    trade with them where they shall have as much Rum as they please &amp; Merchandise at a much
                    cheaper rate than the English or French can sell to them, who only impose on them." Always
                    sensible about a bargain, the Indians were carrying most of their peltry across the <placeName>

                    men not likely to support a regime that could not protect their trade. Capturing the
                    Indians' trade, Abbott believed, represented the first step in a Spanish plan to take over
                    British <placeName>

            <p>The lieutenant governor concluded that same November that he could not rely upon the Indians for help
                    in combatting invaders, whatever the fair promises their chiefs had made. He had learned by then
                    from Celoron that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s war belt. Abbott had decided, moreover, that even the <geogName>White
                    River</geogName> Delawares, the one tribe that had actually offered its military assistance, were
                    "a set of Rascals," for he had just heard that the Delawares "have made
                    Peace with the Rebels." In reality, this report probably told merely of one of the periodic
                    resolutions of neutrality issued by the chiefs of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Delawares. Although the <geogName>White River</geogName> band very likely did not
                    subscribe wholeheartedly-or perhaps at all-to the policy of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> chiefs, Abbott nevertheless took the news as another substantial setback for his Indian

            </p>
            <p>He poured out his pessimism in letters to colleagues like Lernoult and Rocheblave. His correspondence

                    trunks and prepared to abandon his government. He assembled the "principal People"

                    proper fort at their own expense. Against his better judgment, Abbott agreed to re-main through the
                    winter. By this time, however, he knew all too well that he kept his position only at the sufferance
                    of the white and Indian inhabitants of his district.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the ensuing months, furthermore, Abbott also realized that he had been abandoned by Carleton.
                    The last word he had received from his superior was the angry financial edict that had reached him
                    in late August. When Des Ruisseaux delivered Abbott's and Rocheblave's pleas for

                    mid-August, Carleton declined to prepare a substantive reply. Instead, he sent Des Ruisseaux back
                    with a curt note telling Abbott he would honor a bill for the emissary's
                    expenses—after Abbott verified them. This perfunctory message formed his last written
                    communication to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    how he was to protect his government and conduct Indian affairs without troops or money.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Abbott did not even see this final note, moreover, because Des Ruisseaux was

                    agreable to a former order of his not to incur any expence." He explained later to Germain
                    that events during the winter convinced "me to leave the place before the Indians returned

            <p>When Abbott informed Rocheblave of this decision, the horrified <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> commandant hurried overland to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> at once, hoping to find some means of preventing Abbott's going. During a
                    brief conference at the end of January he begged Abbott to remain at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> or at least to join him at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but Abbott would not change his mind. Although he had heard that come spring many
                    loyalists from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> area, having "determined to take the benefit of my placart
                    [handbill]," would seek a refuge at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> "from the oppression of the Rebels," he believed that
                    Carleton's spending proscription left him no alternative but to leave before they or the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> tribesmen showed up at Fort Sackville's gate. Costly experience had taught him
                    that he dared not "meet thou-sands of savages, without presents of ammunition, Liquor,
                    &amp; Merchandise." "Notwithstanding every precaution in my power,"
                    he confessed, "I have [already] been obliged to incurr a great expence to keep the Indians
                    in the crown's interest." Since receiving Carleton's last warning about
                    expenditures, in fact, he had doled out to the tribesmen goods costing some £3,745, a
                    bill the governor might well refuse to pay.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consequently, while Rocheblave glumly embarked upon a re-turn voyage to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Abbott bade farewell to the citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> on February 3. Abbott thought the inhabitants were still "firm in their
                    allegiance to defend Fort Sackville against all enemies of Great Britain," but he
                    nevertheless recognized that they thought "themselves cast off from His Majesty's
                    protection." His departure, coming after so short a stay and the earlier withdrawal of
                    Lord's garrison, effectually forfeited Britain's last semblance of authority in
                    the region, particularly with the tribes of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> valley. Whatever the attendant expense, Abbott still recognized and advocated
                    "the utility of a Person to command at St Vincenne to prevent the Savages entering into the
                    Rebels service." By abandoning his post so precipitately, Rocheblave feared, the lieutenant
                    governor ran "the risk of having the doors shut upon him for a long time to come by the
                    Indians who have been tampered with by our [Spanish] neighbors." Therefore, Abbott did what
                    little he could to provide for the management of Indian and civil affairs in his absence.

                    that emphasized the importance of maintaining Fort Sackville in good repair, of preventing the
                    inhabitants from occupying the ground cleared for the fort's outer emplacements, and of
                    offering protection to any frontier people seeking refuge from the rebels. Regarding the Indians, he
                    only ordered the major to "punish severely" any inhabitants who violated the
                    provision of the provincial trade ordinance of 1777 prohibiting the sale of liquor to Indians
                    without a proper license. Clearly, he also expected Beaulon to act as the king's spokesman

                    neighboring Piankashaws to explain his withdrawal. When he passed by Ouiatanon, however, he could
                    not avoid the tribesmen there, and he had to ask Celoron to distribute in his name merchandise
                    costing £463. Thereafter, Celoron, who acted with <placeName>

                    horse stealing done by young warriors contributed further to the region's instability.

                    </placeName> on March 7 "after a painful journey of thirty three days through the
                    woods." He immediately set about justifying his pullout to British authorities. He also
                    tried to convince them of the importance of the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>-<region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> region and urged them
                    to expend the money necessary to de-fend it properly. He wrote first to Germain, pointing out
                    Carleton's ultimate responsibility for his abandoning his government, and three weeks later
                    to Carleton, detailing the state of affairs at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    </placeName>'s Indian councils, and he also must have talked a good deal about the war and

                    </placeName>, who thereafter would have to assume a greater responsibility for that district. Owing

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> became convinced that "it must be impossible for the Ouabash Indians to be
                    kept in order without a vast expense in presents or the presence of some Troops." The

                    </placeName> manifestly needed British officers and soldiers, he informed Carleton, because the
                    minds of the Indians "are poisoned by the falsehoods and misrepresentations of the French
                    [Canadiens]." Because Britain had failed to enforce its authority for so long, he now
                    understood that the tribes had formed "a presumption of their own importance"
                    which made them inveterately "arrogant and troublesome." Nonetheless, Abbott, ever
                    since returning to the west, had hoped to win them over and employ them in King George's
                    interest. The financial considerations of Indian management alone had compelled him to leave <placeName>

                    employing of Indians has been of great hurt to the cause." "Many hundreds [of
                    settlers] would have put themselves under His Majesty's protection," he asserted,
                    had they not been prevented by marauding Indians. Faced with British-sponsored Indian raids,
                    "These poor unhappy people are forced to take up arms against their Sovereign, or be
                    pillaged &amp; left to starve; cruel alternative." He now thought it
                    "shocking" that "it is not people in arms that Indians will ever daringly
                    attack, but [only] the poor inoffensive families who fly to the deserts [backcountry] to be out of
                    trouble [from the Revolution], and who are inhumanely butchered sparing neither women or
                    children." To those who "said it is necessary to employ Indians to pre-vent their
                    serving our enemies," he offered a startling—and possible
                    practical—alternative. "I will be bold to say," he explained,
                    "their keeping a neutrality will be equally (if not more) serviceable to us as their going
                    to war, for the reason I have already gave [alienating loyalists and neutrals]; &amp; surely the
                    presents they receive will prevent their acting against us." He appealed to
                    Carleton's "known humanity" to "put a stop" to the
                    Indians' indiscriminate guerrilla warfare.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

            <p>Although Abbott's change of heart eventually won him history's laurels as a
                    humanitarian gentleman, it did not change British Indian policy in any way. Abbott's new
                    analysis of the Indians' role in Britain's wartime strategy was probably the most
                    perceptive-and assuredly the most novel—presented by a royal official during the
                    Revolution, but it never found a receptive audience. Carleton, certainly in agreement with such a
                    viewpoint, had resigned and left for <placeName>

                    committed to using Indian raids as part of a policy of active defense for his province.
                    Abbott's radical concept of Indian neutrality was shared only by Thomas Pownall, a former
                    royal governor of <placeName>

                    furnished by Celoron at Ouiatanon in 1778. Haldimand reluctantly settled this debt in order to free

            <p>Photographs used as primary sources for historical research are often necessary adjuncts to the more
                    conventional written sources. The extraction of information from photographs can be fraught with
                    peril, however, for the adage that the camera never lies is simply not true. Aside from the
                    distortion that can occur because of the internal characteristics of the camera, there is the
                    intentional alteration of the resultant prints by the photographer or printer himself. William A.
                        Frassanitol<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and Walter F. Rowe<hi rend="sup">2</hi> have shown how certain
                    Civil War photographers engaged in practices to deceive the public and how their practices have
                    misled historians ever since. The techniques they used to achieve deception included the staging of
                    photographs that were purported to be actual scenes, the use of montages, and the simple mislabeling
                    of prints, either accidentally or intentionally.</p>
            <p>This essay is based on research done on the history of the West Baden Springs Hotel. This hotel was a
                    large mineral spa in West Baden, Indiana, which was in operation from 1855 to 1932. In the course of
                    research into the history of this establishment, hundreds of photographs taken during the period of
                    the early 1890s to the early 1930s have been examined. Some of these photographs were purposely
                    altered or intentionally or accidentally mislabeled, thus mitigating their usefulness as historical
                    evidence. This essay will examine examples of the various types of alterations found among these
                    photographs and captions. In the first section the alterations <list type="footnotes">

                    second section will suggest how the alteration of photographs complicates their use in determining
                    the physical appearance of the West Baden Hotel in the early twentieth century.</p>
            <p>The hotel's most elaborate advertising brochure is a booklet entitled "West Baden
                    Springs—The Carlsbad of America," published sometime between 1909 and 1915. The
                    booklet is forty pages long and contains 107 photographs. Figures 1 through 13 are taken either from
                    this booklet or are newly made prints of the original negatives of prints appearing in it.</p>
            <p>Figures 1 and 2 appear on different pages of the booklet. (The booklet's pages are not
                    numbered.) They are labeled "Exterior Natatorium" and "Power
                    House," respectively. The real powerhouse was sandwiched between the natatorium and the
                    bathhouse, and there was no vantage point from which it could be photographed. Even if other
                    buildings were removed to enable the powerhouse to be seen, it would not look like the picture in
                    Figure 2. A close examination of the two photographs, however, suggests a solution to this dilemma.
                    Figure 1 is a genuine photograph. Its only alterations are the removal of the smokestack (it appears
                    in its proper place in Figure 2) and the addition of many trees in the back-ground. Figure 2 is the
                    same photograph, but with all the surrounding buildings removed. Notice that the white posts in
                    front of the building have been removed in Figure 2. The branches of the shrubs along the front of
                    the building clearly are the same in both views and reveal that the two photographs are of the same
                    building and were probably made from the same negative. The closer these photographs are examined,
                    the more obvious it becomes that they are the same; yet, it also becomes obvious that subtle
                    differences were made by the printer to make them look different. Notice that the sign over the door
                    on the far left of Figure 1 says "Natatorium." Although illegible in Figure 1, it
                    can be seen in the original, and it has been removed in Figure 2. Why the person or persons
                    responsible for the deception in these photographs felt the need to deceive is unclear in this case.</p>
            <p>Figure 3 shows a portion of a panoramic Cirkut<hi rend="sup">3</hi> camera view of the town of West
                    Baden. Figure 4 is made from the original negative used to make Figure 3. That they were made from
                    the same negative can be seen in several areas, but especially note that the people walking along
                    the road on the right are identical in both views. In Figure 3 several things have been removed. The
                    Miller Beer sign and other advertising signs have been removed <list type="footnotes">

                    building wall. Also, the snow and assorted debris have disappeared in Figure 3. Not only have things
                    disappeared, but where there had been a row of advertisements, there is now, miraculously, a row of
                    shrubs. Obviously, these alterations were made by a respect-able hotel that wanted to have a cleaner
                    picture without gaudy advertisements and distracting snow.</p>
            <p>A similar desire to improve the appearance of what actually existed and a desire to emphasize the
                    hotel's name appear to have been the motivations for the alterations made in photographs of
                    the hotel's golf course. Figure 5 shows part of the hotel's golf course, while
                    Figure 6 is a modern print made from the same negative as Figure 5. In Figure 5 the wording
                    "West Baden Golf Links" on the sign, which cannot be seen in Figure 6, has been
                    added, and the light pole to the right of the sign has been removed. Figure 7 is an extension of
                    Figure 5 that shows more of the golf course. Figure 8 is a modern print taken from the same negative
                    of Figure 7. In Figure 7 the path has been removed, and flags have been added to the top of the
                    hotel dome and its two adjacent towers.</p>
            <p>Figure 9 shows a complete page from the booklet. The Sprudel Spring Pavilion is an authentic,
                    unaltered photograph. The spring labeled Hygeia Spring is not a photograph of an actual structure
                    but is, rather, a drawing of a nonexistent structure. Figure 10 is an enlarged detail of Hygeia
                    Spring taken from Figure 9. In this enlargement it can be seen that the structure lacks the
                    crispness of an actual photograph, and that it casts no shadows. The structure pictured in Figure 10
                    was eventually built, but it was built over Apollo Spring not Hygeia Spring. Therefore, this detail
                    of Figure 9 is both spurious and mislabeled.</p>
            <p>Figures 11 and 12 are enlarged details of Neptune Spring and Apollo Spring, respectively, taken from
                    Figure 9. Figure 11 is an actual, unaltered photograph. Figure 12, however, is an extensively
                    altered version of the same photograph in Figure 11. While the style of the pillars, the roofs, and
                    the gingerbread roof supports of the two structures are different, the shape and location of the
                    trees and flagstaffs and the location of the columns in the two pictures are identical. Thus, of the
                    four structures pictured in Figure 9, Neptune Spring and Sprudel Spring are unaltered photographs,
                    Hygeia Spring is an artists drawing, and Apollo Spring is a spurious structure whose photograph is
                    actually an altered print of Neptune Spring.</p>
            <p>Figures 1 through 12 illustrate a variety of levels of photo-graphic accuracy and deception and
                    suggest the difficulties involved in using photographs in historical research. These difficulties
                    become even more evident in the following discussion of the use of photographs to help establish the
                    physical appearance of the West Baden Springs Hotel at various times in its history.</p>

            <p>The date of the construction of the structure over Apollo Spring is unknown. However, Figure 13,
                    which appeared in "West Baden Springs—The Carlsbad of America," seems
                    to provide some information about its construction date when used in conjunction with other known
                    facts. The buildings in Figure 13 are, from left to right, the Sprudel Pavilion, the Opera House,
                    the Hospital, the Apollo Spring, and the covered walk to the hotel building. Since the Opera House,
                    the Hospital, and the covered walk were all destroyed by fire in 1917, Figure 13 must have been
                    taken before that year. Also, since the dirt road in the foreground of Figure 13 was made into an
                    elaborate boulevard in 1914, the picture must have been taken before that year.</p>
            <p>Given the problems with other pictures in the hotel's brochure, however, one must be careful
                    in one's use of Figure 13. Three facts bring the accuracy of Figure 13 into doubt. The
                    first is that Apollo Spring has a lighter shade than the other structures in the picture, and the
                    second is that two portions of Apollo Spring's lighter roof bleed over the darker telephone
                    pole and seem to be between the pole and the viewer. It appears that Apollo Spring has been either
                    penciled or inked or air brushed into Figure 13. The third fact comes from Figure 9. In this picture
                    a drawing of Apollo Spring was added and mislabeled with the name Hygeia Spring. Figure 9 appeared
                    in a booklet that was published no later than 1915. If Apollo Spring had been built in 1915, a
                    photo-not a drawing-of it would have been added to Figure 9. Also, it is unlikely that it would have
                    been mislabeled as Hygeia Spring if it had been an existing structure.</p>
            <p>It is reasonable to assume that the hotel had designs for improvements to be made to the structures
                    over the various springs at the time Figure 9 was published, but that plans for where each structure
                    would go were in a state of flux. Thus, the drawing in Figure 9 is identical to the later-built
                    Apollo Spring because the design of the structure had been made, but it is mislabeled because plans

            <p>Conclusive evidence that Apollo Spring was added to Figure 13 is found in Figures 14 through 17.
                    Figure 14 shows old Spring No. 3 before it was renamed Apollo Spring and a structure was built over
                    it. In the background of this picture is the Sprudel Pavilion, the Opera House, and the covered
                    walkway that connected them. Figure 15 shows the area behind the hotel after the fire of 1917. After
                    this fire the ground level of this area was raised a few feet and new structures were added to form
                    what was called the Formal Gardens. Figure 16 shows the Sprudel Pavilion soon after the fire. The
                    destroyed buildings have been cleared away, but the ground around the Sprudel Pavilion has not yet
                    been raised. After the ground level was raised, the remaining structures were built to make the
                    Sunken Gardens shown in Figure 15. One of the structures built at <hi rend="i">that</hi> time was
                    the one over Apollo Spring. This cirߝ <pb n="[181]" id="VAA4025-083-2-075"/>

            <p>In the modern era of television and movies viewers have be-come accustomed to trick photography and

               <hi rend="i">Religion in Indiana: A Guide to Historical Resources.</hi> By L. C. Rudolph and
                    Judith E. Endelman. (<placeName>

                    </placeName>: Indiana University Press, 1986. Pp. xv, 232. Index. $22.50.)</head>
            <p>L. C. Rudolph and Judith E. Endelman's goal for their project was to produce "a
                    guide to primary and secondary source materials for the study of religion in Indiana" (p.
                    vii). This book has been long awaited by librarians and researchers, who will conclude that the
                    authors have achieved their goal.</p>
            <p>The book is divided into three main sections. The first, "Published Works," covers
                    2,866 books, journal articles, theses, and dissertations; it is arranged alphabetically by author,
                    or by title for those works with no author. The second section, "Repositories,"
                    lists the unpublished primary materials held by 109 institutions around the country. The third
                    section is comprised of "Congregational Histories," which are arranged by county,
                    then by place. Additional features are a succinct "User's Guide" at the
                    beginning that de-scribes the sections and their use in more detail; a list of denominational
                    families; and an index that provides access by subject, personal name, institutional name, and
                    denominational name. While the index does not list primary authors, who can be found in the
                    alphabetical list of published works, it does list secondary authors.</p>
            <p>As with almost any reference book, there will be criticism for what this one does not do. For quick
                    reference, it might have been better for the first section to be arranged by denomination. Some will
                    say that the book should list all the institutions at which a given work can be found rather than
                    just the institution at which the authors examined the copy they listed. This was not intended to be
                    a union catalogue, however, and there are other library tools which can be used to locate additional
                    copies. There are also bound to be appropriate resources which are not listed. This is inevitable
                    given the constraints of time and geography under which the authors worked. They acknowledge, for
                    example, the omission of valuable sources like newspaper articles and county histories. In addition,
                    the responsibility for the completeness of the finished work does not rest entirely with the
                    authors. They had to depend on many correspondents to provide them with information for inclusion,
                    so the quality of the final work rests partially on the quality <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-083-2-084"/>
                    both of the existing collections and the reporting about those collections by those who administer
                    them.</p>
            <p>This book can be recommended to any institution or individual interested in the history of religion
                    in Indiana. It should also be studied by anyone considering a similar project in another state.</p>

            <p>Practitioners of the "new social history" have explored a number of subjects that
                    are implicitly "rural," but this collection explicitly focuses on American
                    "rural history." Its eleven essays set out themes in the "new rural
                    history," a field in which scholars combine the insights of earlier historians with
                    "techniques and themes found in various branches of contemporary social history"
                    (p. 6). Though they acknowledge that to peg the meaning of "rural" precisely is
                    problematic, the editors define a rural community as one with at most five thousand people.</p>
            <p>The questions a historian could ask about rural history are manifold, but despite the variety of
                    possibilities inherent in the subject, Steven Hahn and Jonathan Prude have assembled a remarkably
                    coherent set of essays. With few exceptions, each contribution deals with a fundamental theme, the
                    "capitalist transformation" in rural North, South, and West. For example, Gary
                    Kulik's essay examines conflict over fishing rights between back-country <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName> farmers (defending corporate, public rights) and capitalist furnace and millowners
                    (asserting individual property rights). Steven Hahn chronicles the "unmaking" of
                    the up-country <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> yeomanry in the wake of the Civil War. Robert McMath detects precapitalist cultural

                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> Farmers' Alliance organization.</p>
            <p>The collective thrust of these essays is that rural people and communities became enmeshed over time
                    in the web of capitalist market relationships; the timing varied, but the fundamental contours of
                    the change were similar everywhere: individualistic, profitmaximizing, competititve relations
                    replaced reciprocal, face-to-face, subsistence patterns.</p>
            <p>The essays differ in their interpretation of capitalism's impact, and thereby raise one of
                    the most interesting issues in the "new rural history." Several of the authors
                    find rural people vigorously resisting the capitalist transformation; capitalism is portrayed as <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-083-2-085"/> penetrating an unwilling countryside. But David
                    Jaffee's Yankee portrait makers and their clientele enthusiastically embraced the culture
                    of consumerism; the impression here is of rural entrepreneurs generating capitalist development from
                    within the country-side. Other authors see a complex mix of motivations in operation. Thus the
                    debate over rural Americans' role in and reaction to capitalism is still far from resolved.
                    This collection points to the importance of considering chronology, class, race, ethnicity, and
                    geography in determining who among rural Americans embraced capitalism, and who resisted. Together
                    with such works as Charles Martin's <hi rend="i">Hollybush,</hi> which traces the impact of
                    the cash nexus through folk housing, and Joan Jensen's <hi rend="i">Loosening the
                    Bonds,</hi> about farm women, <hi rend="i">The Countryside in the Age of Capitalist
                    Transformation,</hi> with its essays of uniformly high quality, will establish the "new
                    rural history" as a stimulating and provocative field of study.</p>

            <p>John Hunt Morgan has finally received a thorough and judicious biography. An exemplar of the
                    Confederate guerrilla chief, he was the object of enormous adulation, romantic excess, fear, and
                    bitter hatred by Confederates and Unionists. His life ended in September, 1864, in an attempt to
                    escape from Federal soldiers who had surprised his command.</p>
            <p>James A. Ramage has uncovered all the significant sources on his subject that probably exist. He has
                    a flair for capturing the human interest of Morgan's life and the events and personalities
                    surrounding him. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in Ramage's description of
                    Morgan's raid through southern Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and his imprisonment in and escape from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio State</region>
                    </placeName> Penitentiary. The other great asset of this book is its thoughtful analysis of
                    Morgan's decline, beginning with his second marriage in December, 1862. Ramage blames it on
                    Morgan's emotional attachment to his new wife. Earlier he had gained psychic comfort in the
                    cat-and-mouse games of irregular warfare. Experiencing a satisfying home life, Morgan devoted less
                    care to his command, neglecting details which had earlier made him successful. The book also offers
                    insight into the chasm that existed between the public's perception of a military hero and
                    the reality of his career.</p>
            <p>Ramage seems to admire Morgan despite his faults. It is a compliment to Ramage's fidelity to
                    truth that Morgan comes across as a more reprehensible character than the biographer wants him <pb n="[192]" id="VAA4025-083-2-086"/>

                    in the West. Ramage does not go deeply enough into his character to question Morgan's odd
                    penchant for disguising himself as a Union officer and spying on the enemy; he sees this as evidence
                    of a gambler's personality and tries to tie it to the concept of southern honor, a
                    connection that is not tenable. The bushwhacking and cold-blooded murder Morgan not only practiced
                    but apparently enjoyed had nothing to do with honor or chivalry and had less significance for the
                    war effort than Ramage claims. Morgan was an incredibly selfish, unsavory person; the depths of
                    pillage to which his command descended in 1864 and his own de-termination to desert his men rather
                    than be captured again illustrate his true character. Even if Ramage does not seem to be as deeply
                    aware of all this as is justified by his evidence, he has produced what so few historians have, an
                    interesting book.</p>

            <p>When census canvassers began requesting inhabitants' state or country of birth in 1850, they
                    provided a major boon to American demographers. From 1850 on the census has gathered essential data
                    about this country's settlement history and cultural characteristics. Researchers have
                    examined population origins in all or parts of many states, including those in the Old Northwest.
                    With the publication of this wide-ranging book, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> joins the list. Russel L. Gerlach, a historical geographer, presents <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s nativity origins and settlement history through text, tables, and maps. His
                    sources are those used by geographers, historians, and other social scientists: previous studies,
                    the census, church records, local <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-083-2-088"/> histories and biographies,
                    interviews, correspondence, and field observation.</p>
            <p>The result of his labor is an extensive account of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s population origins, perhaps the most thorough treatment any state has yet
                    received. Its entire settlement history is considered, from the Indians and earliest white and black
                    arrivals through the 1980 census. American and foreign migrants, whose convergence on the national
                    crossroads of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> was aided by its position at the junction of the <geogName>Ohio</geogName>,
                        <geogName>Mississippi</geogName>, and <geogName>Missouri river valleys</geogName>, chose
                    settlement locations according to economic potential and accessibility. Chapters describe population
                    sources and settlement pat-terns in periods to 1980 and place <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s experience into its larger national context. An appendix lists by county the
                    leading nativity or ethnic groups in 1860 and 1980 and the location of unique settlements. A
                    "wall map" on a separate sheet is essentially a distillation of the book, locating
                    and identifying ethnic enclaves both large (Germans, French) and small (Swedes, Bohemians) among the
                    old-stock Americans (predominantly from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>,

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>). Hoosiers will be especially interested in the significance of Indiana natives among
                    early Missourians (fifth largest population source in 1860 and fourth in 1890) and the growth of
                    Amish and Mennonite communities since 1945.</p>
            <p>Only minor problems mar the book. The lightest tone on some choropleth maps disappeared in
                    reproduction. The wall map is not dated, although according to the sources and text it displays
                    mostly nineteenth-century conditions. The book may not delve deeply enough into the details of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s past to please some readers, but its purpose is to "provide a
                    geographic data base" for future research by discovering the "where" of
                    sources and settlements rather than the "why" of differences among groups (p. v).
                    Before the why can be thoroughly determined the where must be revealed, and this Gerlach does
                    excellently.</p>

            <p>For most of the nineteenth century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a major industrial city with many successful firms and a large labor force. In
                    recent years, however, it has attracted far less scholarly attention than a host of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> villages. Steven J. Ross partially remedies this omission with an extended description
                    of the evolution of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> labor force. Much of his account has a familiar ring. For example, he distinguishes
                    between an "Age of the Artisan" (1788–1843), when handicraft production
                        <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-083-2-089"/> was the rule, and an "Age of
                    Manufacturing" (1843–1873), when the factory emerged. His third category, an
                    "Age of Modern Industry" (1873–1890), when large factories succeeded
                    the small mid-century plants, is more novel but questionable. Other features of the story are also
                    familiar. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> workers (as well as other Cincinnatians) subscribed to a "republican
                    ideology"; workers more often saw themselves as Germans or Protestants or Odd Fellows than
                    as wage earners; and labor unions grew in good times and declined in depression periods. Indeed,
                    until the 1880s, there was little to distinguish the experiences of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> workers from those of the workers that John R. Commons <hi rend="i">et al.</hi>
                    described in their pioneering, four-volume <hi rend="i">History of Labor in the <placeName>

               </hi> (1918–1935) and that various other authors have recounted in the
                    interim. In the mid-1880s, a time of general labor upheaval, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> workers became more aggressive and united, winning many strikes and nearly capturing
                    control of the city government. Ross devotes approximately a quarter of his book to these episodes,
                    and it is those final chapters which are his principal contribution.</p>
            <p>Was there more to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> story than Ross has uncovered? Possibly. Though Ross's documentation is
                    impressive, he has not found the kinds of information, such as payrolls and other internal business
                    records, that permit a precise view of changes in employment and working conditions. Too often he is
                    forced to infer relationships (e.g., an increase in average factory size led to greater insecurity
                    and dissatisfaction). More important, the records Ross uses reflect the perspectives of artisans and
                    factory craftsmen, a large though hardly representative group of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> workers. Through most of the nineteenth century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s major employer was the meat-packing and meat by-product industries, which
                    employed few skilled workers. Ross devotes five pages to the meat-packers and their workers and
                    disregards the soap and candlemakers, though a recent paper by Steve Gordon has demonstrated that
                    abundant records are available. In view of the ethnocultural divisions that Ross documents, there is
                    good reason to doubt that the skilled workers' leaders and publicists spoke for all <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> industrial workers. Finally, Ross is preoccupied with the workers' failure to
                    put their jobs ahead of other ties and allegiances and makes much of their united efforts between
                    1884 and 1887. But which pattern was the rule and which was the exception? Ross's data
                    suggest that the events of the mid-1880s were the aberration and that his efforts to find a common
                    class consciousness might have been devoted to more productive issues.</p>
            <p>Though Ross has brought together much useful information about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> workers in the nineteenth century, the city's potential for economic and labor
                    historians remains largely unrealized.</p>

            <p>Probably the universal symbol of the American frontier is the log building. Not only have log
                    buildings in general, and log cabins in particular, become the physical representation of westward
                    expansion, they have also assumed political and social significance in American culture. While the
                    log structure is an American symbol, it is clearly of European origin. Terry G. Jordan's
                    purpose in pre-paring this book is to document the Old World roots of American log construction.</p>
            <p>After reviewing some of the recent major work on the subject, <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> defines the parameters of his investigation. The study is limited to one type of folk
                    architecture and one colonial culture known as the Midland culture area. "From a presumed
                    hearth area in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> Valley, this style spread with the yeoman farmer frontier and eventually dominated a
                    large wedge of territory broadening to the west from its Pennsylvanian apex, extending as far as the
                    Great Plains" (p. 7). This type of construction appears in most of the eastern half of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and includes most of the Midwest.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> thoroughly examines the characteristics of log construction of Midland American log
                    culture. Among these characteristics are timber shaping and placement, corner timbering, gable and
                    roof designs, floor plans of dwellings, log barn construction, and other log structures and fencing.
                    Photographs, illustrations, and maps are effectively used in this section and throughout the book to
                    assist the reader in understanding technical aspects of log construction.</p>
            <p>Three different theses of the Old World origins of Midland American log architecture have been
                    proposed, and each are analyzed by Jordan. "The potential agents of diffusion include (1)
                    northern Europeans, mainly Swedes and Finns from central <placeName>

                    Alemannic regions of southern central Europe beginning about 1710" (p. 7). After carefully
                    analyzing the three potential areas of origin, <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> concludes "that the greatest shaping influence on Midland American log
                    construction was exerted by settlers from the Fenno-Scandian area" (p. 147).</p>

            <p>David D. Van Tassel and John J. Grabowski argue in the preface that "cities have
                    personalities" (p. vii) and that this book is a <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-083-2-092"/>

                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (p. vii). What is special about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> and what has emerged from its history with "remarkable consistency,"
                    according to the editors, is the "primacy of reform in all periods of the city's
                    past" (p. vii). The editors define reform as an effort to correct social and political
                    faults, and they contend that "some reforms may be perceived as good, some may not, and
                    others are simply incomprehensible"(p. 3). To that end eight reform movements extending
                    from the nineteenth century into the twentieth century are covered, including temperance,
                    abolitionism, civil rights, the women's movement, educational reform, Protestant
                    benevolences, social and settlement reform, and political reform. The foremost factor that
                    controlled the selection of the topics was their "chronological position in the
                    city's history" (p. 3).</p>
            <p>As the essays show, the distinctive character of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s reform was shaped by its business needs and its New <placeName>

                    </placeName> communal heritage, which were central to its "communal psyche" (p.
                    3). Reformers often steered a conservative, middle course, as James Richardson's essay on
                    "Political Reform" and Mayor Tom L. Johnson demonstrates. In general, the essays
                    support the editors' assertion of a middling, moderate reform course. When the middle
                    ground was forsaken for militant and radical politics, reform ceased to work in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In an "Epilogue" the editors bring the story down through the last two decades and
                    puzzle why reform has atrophied or otherwise changed into less recognizable forms. The 1960s
                    delivered to Cleve-land more than its share of hard knocks. Public housing, which had been the
                    reformers' pride in the 1930s, had degenerated into crime-ridden, minighettoes. Along with
                    this degeneration came riots, police shootouts with black militants, and a rising tide of violence
                    and disorder that even black Mayor Carl Stokes could not stay. In addition, the <geogName>Cuyahoga
                        River</geogName> caught fire, the city defaulted on its debt payment, and an urban populist
                    mayor, Dennis Kucinich, parodying Tom L. Johnson, brought administrative chaos and nonstop turmoil. <placeName>

                    detractors as the "mistake on the lake" (p. 11). Yet, through all of the travail
                    of the 1960s and 1970s, the editors perceive a remnant of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s reform tradition still functioning at the board level of community
                    organizations.</p>
            <p>This is an interesting book and contains many essays that students of urban politics and history will

            <p>Interest in American material culture has grown rapidly in recent years, as is evidenced by the
                    number of new publications and courses on the subject. Studies of the material manifestations of
                    past cultures have evolved from simple descriptions of physical objects to analyses of the weave of
                    objects in the daily lives of individuals and communities and considerations of the belief
                    systems—values, attitudes, ideas—of the individual who made or used them.
                    Consequently, it has become easier to examine and understand material objects within their broader
                    historical and cultural contexts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Grasping Things,</hi> the latest work from Simon J. Bronner, transcends typical
                    discussions of material objects in American life. It seeks to define the basic tenets of
                    "folk culture" and "mass society" and to describe the tension
                    between the two spheres. In so doing, Bronner focuses on the "souls" of and human
                    encounters with objects, which he defines as "extensions of ourselves and as mediators of
                    social relations" (p. xii). He argues that the inherent meaning of any object ultimately
                    reflects the characteristics of the cultural environment that created it and, therefore, of its
                    makers and users.</p>
            <p>Bronner divides his discussion according to the principal segments of material life behavior and
                    illustrates his thesis with rich examples taken from his fieldwork in rural and urban America.
                    "Entering Things" describes how shelters and the use of space reflect the cultural
                    influences, values, ideas, and social priorities of their builders and residents. "Making
                    Things" elucidates the motivations behind physical expressions of human creativity, ranging
                    from hand-carved tombstones to genre paintings. Bronner also distinguishes between production in
                    folk cultures, characterized by handwork, variation, and practicality, and that of mass society,
                    represented by automation, uniformity, and faddism. "Consuming Things" follows the
                    development of human consumption from an expression of community fellowship and utility to a display
                    of "wealth and status through the wasteful extravagant purchase and display of
                    goods" (p. 160).</p>
            <p>Bronner's study concentrates upon conflict between spirit, family, and community in folk
                    cultures and materialism, technology, and progress in mass society. He also examines how modern
                    society has trivialized physical expressions of folk cultures and subjugated them to the
                    materialistic values of their present owners rather than emphasize their historical-cultural
                    contexts and illuminate the creativity of their original makers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Grasping Things</hi> is a provocative, thoughtful study of pluralistic human behavior
                    and values within American society. While <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-083-2-094"/> it seeks to
                    "describe things in action [and] to analyze them as parts of cultural scenes where actors
                    can be identified" (p. xi), the book also calls on Americans to examine past and present
                    values and to grasp hold of those which provide personal, communal, and social meaning and guidance
                    for the future.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Transplanted</hi> is an impressive effort to bring together the extensive research
                    that American historians have conducted since the 1960s on European immigration to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. John Bodnar demonstrates an impressive knowledge of the secondary literature, both on
                    the old world background and the immigrant experience in America. He examines a wide range of
                    topics, including the family, the adjustment process, religion and other immigrant institutions, the
                    impact of the newcomers on unionism and radicalism, the rise of an immigrant middle class, attitudes
                    toward education, and immigrants in urban politics. This book has much to commend it. However, one
                    might conclude from reading The Transplanted that American immigration history stopped when the flow
                    of European newcomers ended because of World War I and restrictive legislation in the 1920s.</p>
            <p>Even before the 1920s America experienced immigration from Asia and from elsewhere in the Western
                    Hemisphere. Bodnar ignores these sources. Even more significant is his silence concerning the fact
                    that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is at present experiencing another wave of immigration, one as momentous as the earlier
                    movement from Europe. One result of this current immigration is that by 1983 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName> could be described as the new Ellis Island. Since 1968, when the 1965 immigration law
                    went into effect, the character of American immigration has undergone dramatic changes. Prior to
                    that date Europe was the principal (although not the only) source of immigration; since then the
                    predominant sources are the Third World nations of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and
                    Asia.</p>
            <p>From 1971 to 1979, 3,962,675 immigrants entered the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, 39.2 percent from Latin America, 34.1 percent from Asia, and only 18.3 percent from
                    Europe. In addition to legal immigration estimates of undocumented aliens entering the country range
                    from one-half million to one million annually. The post-1968 immigration represents a watershed in
                    the ethnic composition of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Congress has wrestled for years with the problem of illegal immigration, particularly
                    from south of the border. Right <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-083-2-095"/> now would appear to be a time
                    when immigration historians could offer guidance or at least perspective on a current problem of
                    major importance. <hi rend="i">The Transplanted</hi> reflects the fact that we historians fix our
                    eyes firmly on the past, glorying in the accuracy of our hind-sight and avoiding involvement in the
                    problems of the present.</p>
            <p>Bodnar has done an effective job in dealing with the problems that he has identified and therefore
                    accomplishes what he set out to do. <hi rend="i">The Transplanted</hi> is not, however, a
                    comprehensive history of immigration to the <placeName>

            <p>If Martha Farnsworth was typical of the women living on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> prairie in the latter part of the nineteenth century, then there were a lot of very
                    spirited women in mid-America. The fact that she kept such an informative and literate diary for
                    forty years, however, makes Farnsworth atypical.</p>
            <p>Farnsworth was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> at age five. She began her diary in 1882 at age fifteen and continued it until two
                    years before her death in 1924. We follow her through her disastrous first marriage, the death of
                    her only child at age five months, and the death of her abusive, consumptive husband. Blessed with a
                    firm religious background that gave her the inner strength to cope with her afflictions, Martha
                    entered a second marriage with Fred Farnsworth that lasted twentynine years. During these happy
                    years she was active in women's clubs, politics, and the long struggle for women's
                    suffrage. Never able to have more children, Martha acted as a surrogate mother for years, and
                    conducted a Sunday School class for boys that was especially rewarding for both her and her husband.</p>

            <p>Editors Marlene Springer and Haskell Springer are to be commended for their selection of entries from
                    the four thousand pages of Martha Farnsworth's original sixteen handwritten volumes. Only
                    when events were repetitious or fragmentary do they give a brief summary. The Springers'
                    introduction to the diary is a superb explanatory essay that complements Martha's writing.
                    At the end of <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-083-2-096"/> the diary is an epilogue explaining briefly the
                    last two years of Martha's life, which, as the editors so poignantly say, "leaves
                    one with a regrettable sense of incompleteness." Although that is true, this reader felt a
                    great sense of pride in sharing the delightful firstperson account of the life of one remarkable
                    woman.</p>

            <p>This extremely well-written book describes the history of the author's family in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> from 1880 to 1940. It is a captivating blend of historical documents and a
                    novelist's vision. The dust jacket blurbs by Morley Safer—"a jewel of a
                    book"—and William Bundy—"a marvelous family
                    epic"—seem incongruous due to their careers in television and foreign affairs,
                    but this reviewer must repeat their high praise. Few words can express the powerful feelings that
                    spring forth from the flat pages of print. The joys and sorrow, the tears and laughter, all these
                    emotions entangle the reader in a story that begins with a wedding in 1913.</p>
            <p>The author, a successful journalist and novelist, decided to compose his family history despite
                    sibling assurances that the family was not significant. Rather, Critchfield wrote, "it was
                    their ordinariness that made them matter" (p. 413). This is not to say that two generations
                    of country and small-town doctors represent the typical Iowan or North Dakotan. Instead, the author
                    depicts his family as an organic structure that grew and withered depending on the prompts and
                    pressures; weddings, children, dreams, tragedies, success, failure, rapid changes in knowledge and
                    technology, and the strengths and weaknesses of saints and sinners. While their occupations may have
                    made the main characters out of the ordinary, their experiences encompassed the ordinary.</p>
            <p>The story is a great success, and the author's technique of interspersing historical
                    sources—diaries, letters, photographs, and interviews (taped and
                    stenographic)—with "you are there" dialogues and vivid descriptions
                    make this a powerful book. The reader rejoices with the characters when they celebrate and cry as
                    the author details his father's unsuccessful battle with alcohol and heartbreaking affair
                    with a young girl. Life was not easy in a small <placeName>

                    Upper Midwest. Great technological and educational changes were taking place all across America, and
                    while farm life in <placeName>

                    </placeName>—"God had leveled the whole country out with a rolling pin"
                    (p. 103)—is not the same as farm life in Indiana, there are similarities that strike
                    Hoosier chords.</p>
            <p>The book is not perfect. Editorial decisions separated fine and proper photographs from the
                    applicable text—in one case by more than two hundred pages. The subtitle, <hi rend="i">An
                        American Album,</hi> does not add to the reader's understanding. The dust jacket
                    emphasizes that this is the story of an "ordinary" family struggling with a
                    rapidly changing world. More accurately, the hero—a doctor—and the
                    heroine—his wife—were the offspring of ordinary, educated, rural doctors. The
                    ordinary farmer and merchant would have had different viewpoints and experiences as they coped with
                    a new way of life even though they shared a similar fate in the Depression. Also, the explanation of
                    the author's techniques and motivations do not appear until the epilogue and afterword. An
                    earlier placement would have prevented an occasional wondering if "an interview with
                    Anna" and "a letter to Jim," were citations or creations of the author.</p>
            <p>Such a well-written and documented book must be recommended to a wide variety of readers and
                    institutions. It is a marvelous account of one family's life in the breadbasket of our
                    nation. The local scene—Alfalfa Day, farm accidents, blizzards, grasshoppers, a
                    syphilitic young man—while dominant, is connected to state and national events and tied
                    into the popular culture of the 1880–1940 era as a way of keeping the reader in touch
                    with more familiar guideposts—holidays, popular music, war, fashion, and fads. Historians
                    will be intrigued by the author's methods, and every reader will be educated and
                    entertained.</p>

                    comparative study of medium-sized communities in ten metropolitan areas in the nation's
                    heartland. Elazar examined local politics during the era 1946 to 1961 in cities ranging from

                        </placeName> Revisited,</hi> Elazar and a coterie of disciples have returned to the previously
                    examined communities to survey the changing course of politics during the second half of the postwar
                    generation from 1962 to 1977. Whereas most studies of local politics present a snapshot of a
                    community in a single time period, Elazar boasts that <hi rend="i">Cities of the <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                        </placeName> Revisited</hi> and his earlier volume together offer a portrait over time, thus
                    "creating the basis for a more systematic and substantial longitudinal comparison than has
                    ever been undertaken in the study of urban politics" (p. 8).</p>
            <p>The new book consists of two sections. In the first 160 pages Elazar presents an overview, describing
                    the changing rhythms of local politics in the midwestern communities. Then in the last 90 pages his
                    four coauthors each contribute a case study that rein-forces Elazar's arguments. The four
                    subjects of the case studies are Pueblo, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Champaign</settlement>-<settlement type="city">Urbana</settlement>, <region type="county">Decatur</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, and Joliet, <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>A repeated theme in both the overview and the case studies is the adaptation of local politics to
                    increased federal intervention and to the new stream of federal money flowing from the Great Society
                    programs of the late 1960s. During the 1950s the federal presence by comparison was minor. Elazar
                    and his colleagues discover that the heartland communities adapted to the new federal initiatives
                    without sacrificing their local political culture. For example, Maren Allan Stein finds that the
                    political character of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur</region>
                    </placeName> did not change markedly in the 1960s and 1970s despite the proliferation of federal
                    programs. For better or worse, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur</region>
                    </placeName> remained distinctively <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>On the whole, Elazar's overview and the four case studies re-veal much that will be of
                    interest to political scientists and urban scholars in general. Even though Elazar and his
                    colleagues surveyed no Indiana communities, their approach to the study of medium-sized cities and
                    their conclusions should prove stimulating to anyone concerned with the Hoosier cities that are not
                    too distant in mileage or culture from <placeName>

            <p>This book, a volume in the new American Movement series, has special value for college courses on
                    modern urban America. Jon C. Teaford, the author of perceptive studies in the history of municipal
                    government, here applies his talents to a wider theme, the general growth and fragmentation of the
                    modern metropolitan <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-083-2-099"/> city. Beginning with the hopes of
                    Progressive idealists for a unified urban community, Teaford expertly depicts the unfolding
                    realities of metropolitan development into the 1980s. His picture is clear: except for the years of
                    the Great Depression and of World War II, the motif is the flight of urbanized Americans from cities
                    to suburbs, an irreversible impulse facilitated by highways and auto-mobiles and motivated by the
                    urge to escape from ethnic and racial diversity. This is the dominant reality that has consistently
                    defeated even the best efforts of local and national administrations to prevent the deterioration of
                    the central cities. The typical result is an increasingly decentralized metropolis of discrete
                    suburban fragments in which the central city itself is becoming simply another suburb.</p>
            <p>Teaford has incorporated an impressive variety of interesting and significant matters into his
                    expanding metroscape. He introduces us to such people as the moral reformer Arthur B. Farwell and
                    the mobster Al Capone, as well as to such contrasting situations as the planned suburb of Radburn
                    and the unplanned ghetto of Pruitt-Igoe. In his penultimate chapter, "An Age of
                    ‘Urban Crisis,’ 1964–1979," he provides us with able
                    summations of the urban policies devised by both the Johnson and Nixon administrations and with a
                    succinct analysis of the fiscal crises that hamstrung <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and other cities in the 1970s. The shortness of this book, of course, precludes some
                    things that someone will think important-for instance, the "New Towns" planning of
                    the 1960s and the process of gentrification in the 1970s. Also, although most readers will
                    appreciate the author's emphasis on the dominating influence of social and ethnic
                    separatism, some will regret his lapses into cynicism (e.g., Al Capone as a "true
                    molder" of the city) and his seeming indifference to the positive side of metropolitan
                    development. In its overall excellence, though, this book has value for all students of modern urban
                    America. Do I plan to use it in my own urban history course? Yes, most definitely.</p>

                    short, was whether the unions had become irrelevant." Robert H. Zieger's
                    sympathetic history of American unions, without answering this question directly, leaves open the
                    possibility that they had.</p>
            <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-083-2-100"/>
            <p>The narrative begins in the 1920s, when American workers found themselves disunited and disadvantaged
                    in an era of apparent prosperity, and concludes in the mid-1980s, when the same observations could
                    be made. In between, Zieger charts the rapid rise and the gradual decline of organized labor as a
                    major social force.</p>
            <p>The Depression set the stage for a rebirth of unions, and their entry into politics. Rapid growth in
                    the 1930s led to intense labor-management strife which neither existing union structures (i.e., the
                    American Federation of Labor (AFL)) nor the early New Deal (i.e., the National Recovery
                    Administration) could contain. The Wagner Act achieved industrial peace and ordained both the
                    successes and the limitations of American unionism by turning unions into managers of rank-and-file
                    discontents, employers into guarantors of union membership rolls, and the National Labor Relations
                    Board into the red-tape-laden referee. Hardly was this new arrangement and the Congress of
                    Industrial Organizations (CIO) in place before World War II broke out. During the war the deal cut
                    in the Wagner Act was ratified by labor's No-Strike Pledge and by management's
                    maintenance of union membership. Unlike their World War I ancestors, the new and the newly strong
                    unions of 1945 survived the conversion to peacetime. The Taft-Hartley Act limited long-term union
                    security more than it did short-term union successes. By winning for their members a larger piece of
                    the larger American pie with hard-fought strikes and savvy political maneuvering, the AFL and CIO
                    moved into the 1950s as the stable representatives of increasingly affluent workers. But by the
                    1960s the decline of unions both in percentage of the work force they represented and in their
                    ability to adapt to (let alone lead) social change was apparent. Buffeted by the issues of <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> and civil rights, union leaders found themselves attacked by militants as part of the
                    establishment, deserted by their membership for Republican candidates or George Wallace, and all the
                    while manhandled by managements who had learned to flout the National Labor Relations Act with
                    impunity. In 1968 came the moment of truth: Hubert Humphrey was defeated. But still worse lay in
                    store: the Reagan era of massive unemployment, give-backs, and union busting. Zieger offers
                    counterarguments to those who see unions as responsible for the deindustrialization of America, but
                    can find no John L. Lewis on labor's horizon to marshal the forces anew.</p>
            <p>Zieger's account, using a rich variety of earlier works, is generally well woven, concise,
                    and adept. He gives a friendly hearing to mainline union leadership, shorter shrift to critics right
                    and left. He places particular emphasis on the history of the United Auto-mobile Workers of America.
                    He makes occasional mention of Indiana's position as a conservative state which still
                    reflects national developments on the labor scene. Particularly lucid is his treatment <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-083-2-101"/> of complex labor laws, and particularly sympathetic is his grasp of the
                    problems of female and black unionists.</p>
            <p>Little will be found in these pages that is new, and fellow scholars may be frustrated by his
                    substitution of bibliographical essays for footnotes. His treatment of the years from 1968 to 1985
                    in a brief epilogue is a disappointment. Yet, Zieger has compiled an altogether useful account of
                    what for now appears to have been the golden era of labor in the <placeName>

            <p>"Broadacre City is everywhere and nowhere" (p. 145). When Robert H. Walker quoted
                    Frank Lloyd Wright's description of his new town utopia, he unwittingly characterized his
                    own book. After a lifetime of studying reform in America, Walker has written a
                    "constructive synthesis" of a "continuing frontier" he sees
                    everywhere and in every age. His book, more an extended essay than a freshly researched monograph,
                    invites historians to view the "reform spirit" in American history as continuous
                    rather than periodized. In re-defining the language and patterns of reform he seeks to show that
                    "directed social change constitutes a vital and undervalued part of this nation's
                    meaning" (pp. vii-ix).</p>
            <p>Walker's ambitious synthesis of American reform is organized around three
                    "modes." "Politico-economic reform," focused mainly on the
                    politics of money from Jackson's veto to the Federal Reserve Act, also deals with poverty,
                    labor reform, and suffrage. His second mode, "Social Justice for All," discusses
                    the extension of political and economic participation to those "special groups"
                    (blacks and women) who have been "outside the mainstream" but also explores civil
                    liberties, temperance, and the asylum movement. Mode III covers utopian "planners and
                    dreamers," ranging from antebellum to modern communes, literary utopias to science fiction,
                    and builders of new towns to designers of world government.</p>
            <p>To structure all this material into 210 pages, Walker has in-vented a new quasi-quantitative
                    "taxonomy," which he calls "analytical social history." Within
                    each of the "modes" are four "logical subheadings." The terms
                    are new but hardly the categories. He discusses reform in terms of "the principal
                    actors" (seen as associations and governments rather than people, who are largely missing
                    from the book), the "arguments and assumptions" of reformers, and the
                    "forms" and "dynamics" of reform, which include both a <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-083-2-102"/> "five-stage cycle" and a "two-stage
                    sequence" (summarized in a useful chart on p. 184).</p>
            <p>Such an immense effort in such a thin book cannot help but to fail. Walker's preference for
                    modes rather than chronology is ultimately ahistorical. Temperance is included in Mode II because
                    the "victims of alcohol … can be considered a special group" (p. 109).
                    He compares the American Anti-Slavery Society with the NAACP, "which followed in its
                    footsteps virtually every step of the way" (p. 73). <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom's
                    Cabin</hi> is compared to John Steinbeck's <hi rend="i">Travels with Charley,</hi> and
                    Theodore Dwight Weld to Daniel Patrick Moynihan (pp. 75-77)!</p>
            <p>These alternatingly obvious and stretched points are all the more distressing because Walker
                    celebrates "the rising spirit" of the early Reagan years when poverty, he asserts,
                    is being reduced, when new groups are being integrated into the mainstream, and when
                    "social change is alive and well" (p. 196). The underlying point of his book, that
                    "all eras are reform eras" (p. 180), is a particularly inappropriate claim to make
                    for the 1980s.</p>
            <p>Walker's work is flawed but challenging. Any book that is at once everywhere and nowhere
                    inevitably contains innovative in-sights that jolt one's comfortable categorization of
                    time-tested truths. Moreover, his synthesis is interspersed with six "encounters,"
                    little human vignettes intended to illustrate his themes. Some do and some do not, but all are
                    sensitive and well written, especially a delightful account of the failed attempt of a group of
                    exceptional local women to get credit for auditing courses at all-male <placeName>

                    </placeName> College in the 1960s. The six encounters are a highlight, and one wishes that Walker
                    had lessened his analysis and filled the book with more of these stories. He tells them well.</p>

            <p>This valuable new volume grew out of a conference held at Purdue University in 1983 to assess the
                    current state of the study and teaching of Afro-American history. It was jointly sponsored by the
                    American Historical Association, the Lilly Endowment, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
                    The fourteen papers included in this book, some accompanied by critical and expansive commentary,
                    address issues related to the slave experience, to the impact of emancipation, to the urbanization
                    of blacks, to the evolution of professional scholarship in Afro-American history, and to <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-083-2-103"/> the relationship of that scholarship and that history to a more
                    complete understanding and presentation of American history.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The State of Afro-American History: Past, Present, and Future</hi> is one of two
                    important new books published during 1986 that seek to examine Afro-American history as an
                    increasingly important field of study during the twentieth century. The other is <hi rend="i">Black
                        History and the Historical Profession: 1915–1980</hi> by August Meier and the late
                    Elliot Rudwick. These two volumes should be read together. The former is more topical and less
                    systematic, and the latter focuses more upon the historians who have worked in the field than upon
                    the scholarship itself. Both of these books address the internal and external issues pertinent to
                    the evolution of the study of Afro-American history. They demonstrate clearly, as John Hope Franklin
                    explained in his keynote address at the Purdue conference, that this subject has always been charged
                    with political and social implications. Furthermore, these works provide powerful evidence that the
                    writing and interpreting of this subject, as well as the Afro-American experience, itself, have a
                    very significant history.</p>
            <p>The essays from the Purdue conference vary considerably in their depth and focus. Perhaps the most
                    useful ones for historians are Armstead Robinson's "The Difference Freedom Made:
                    The Emancipation of Afro-Americans" and Kenneth Kusmer's revision of a previously
                    published piece, "The Black Urban Experience in American History." The analyses in
                    these articles are tight and their bibliographies are extensive. Conversely, the contributions of
                    Leslie Owens and Nathan Huggins are more suggestive and free-wheeling. Huggins is especially
                    convincing in his demonstration of the importance of seriously and completely "Integrating
                    Afro-American History Into American History." The collective scholarship of these essays
                    not only <hi rend="i">testifies</hi> to the state of Afro-American history but also makes clear the
                    ongoing need to maintain the scholarly search for a new and more openly inclusive and synthetic <hi rend="i">American history.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The State of Afro-American History,</hi> for all its generally careful scholarship and
                    editing, also reveals (if more implicitly than explicitly) the presence of two subjective issues,
                    internal to the field, that have been and still are a part of the "state of Afro-American
                    history." They also happen to be issues given considerable attention in <hi rend="i">Black
                        History and the Historical Profession.</hi> First, the political implications and emotional
                    nature of race in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> have made it impossible or undesirable for historians to avoid drawing conclusions and
                    making evaluations regarding the basic "goodness," "fairness,"
                    or "progress" of American society as it has defined the opportunities open to
                    black Americans. The sense of either optimism or pessimism expressed in these evaluations <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-083-2-104"/> including those under review) has been and continues to be a
                    part of the writing, preserving, and presenting of Afro-American history.</p>
            <p>The second of the subjective issues is the internal one of ownership, which, while less volatile and
                    open than it was during the late 1960s and early 1970s, still may be found within the historical
                    profession. <hi rend="i">The State of Afro-American History</hi> never addresses the controversy
                    head on, but the insider (black historians)-outsider (white historians) question can be found
                    beneath the surface in some of its essays. The fact that such issues continue to exist is not
                    inherently "bad"; their presence, however, does demonstrate something fundamental
                    and, at the same time, less than fully mature about the "state of Afro-American
                    history" in the 1980s. The Purdue conference and the volume that it produced were and are
                    timely and important.</p>

                    $2.00.) This pamphlet is a very good spin-off from the large project to write a history
                    of the General Assembly. Alan F. January's text provides an interesting account of the
                    struggles of black legislators to remove racial restrictions from the state constitution in the late
                    nineteenth century and to further the cause of civil rights in the twentieth century. Especially
                    evocative of past conditions is the refusal of downtown <placeName>

                    1950s—an example of discrimination that added another handicap to their legislative work.
                    In addition to the narrative the publication includes a biographical sketch for each of the forty
                    black men and women who have served in the General Assembly. <hi rend="i">James H. Madison, Indiana

                    data range from population to housing to social welfare to agriculture, first for the entire state
                    with comparisons to the nation and then for each county. A final section provides a statistical
                    profile of each county. The 1990 census will necessitate a new version of this reference source, but

                    Region." Mexicans arrived in the Region in the 1920s to work in the steel mills and
                    constituted thereafter an important part of the special mix of peoples and cultures in northwest
                    Indiana. The oral interviews and essays in this collection—the work of students at
                    Indiana University Northwest—provide a good illustration of and documentation for the
                    dynamics of acculturation and the simultaneous retention of ethnic culture. The volume may be

                    Phillip M. Hoose's account of high school basketball includes chapters on the teams and
                    players of the 1950s and 1960s—Milan and Bobby Plump, Crispus Attucks and Oscar Robinson,
                    Lebanon and the Mount family. More recent subjects include Larry Bird, Steve Alford, and Judi <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>. Hoose captures the mentality of high school basketball in Anderson, at Meadowood Park,
                    and in small rural communities, but not at Attucks. Historians will wish that he had devoted more
                    attention to the early twentieth century and to the origins and evolution of Indiana's
                    identification with the sport. John Feinstein's book presents a close-up look at Indiana
                    University's team during the 1985–1986 season, focusing attention on the
                    controversial coach. The book became a national bestseller during the winter of 1987, adding another
                    point to the state's commanding lead as the heartland of hoops. The time will come when a
                    serious historian will provide a scholarly analysis of the sport set in full contexts of time and
                    place. <hi rend="i">James H. Madison, Indiana University, Blooming-ton.</hi>

                    essay, index. Clothbound, $39.50; paperbound, $14.95.) In this book Jean H.
                    Baker describes the various ways that men became Democrats in the midnineteenth century, then the
                    dominant ideas and beliefs held by Democrats, and finally the ways in which Democratic attitudes and
                    beliefs were expressed and reinforced by the political behavior and rhetoric of party members and
                    their leaders. For Baker Democratic political culture was a variation on common American beliefs and
                    values. Thus, while the party inculcated in its members beliefs distinctive from those of other
                    Americans, these differences were not great, and the party was able to serve as a nationalizing
                    force that tied its members to mainstream American attitudes, or at least close variations of them.</p>
            <p>In the first section of the book Baker suggests reasons why people became Democrats by analyzing a
                    heavily Democratic <placeName>
                        <region type="county">New Jersey county</region>
                    </placeName> and seven individual Democrats from various parts of the North, including William
                    Steele Holman of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. She next describes how the public schools inculcated common national values
                    in all its students, whether sons of Democrats or of members of other parties. In the second section
                    of the book Baker outlines the dominant beliefs and attitudes of midnineteenth-century Democrats.
                    These included racism, a variety of republicanism, intense patriotism and Americanism, and a
                    Burkean-like conservative naturalism. She finds one or more of these beliefs and attitudes expressed
                    in such widely varied sources as the writings and speeches of Stephen Douglas, minstrel shows, and
                    various other sources. In the third section of the book Baker discusses the behavior and policies of
                    the Democrats. Her discussion focuses on the 1960s and especially the rituals—parades,
                    rallies, ballot casting—of the elections of 1864 and 1868 and the issues of loyalty
                    during the Civil War and of policy toward the South after the war.</p>
            <p>The cogency of Baker's arguments varies widely from section to section. The part of the book
                    concerning how men became Democrats and the part examining the views of the Bayard family of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> appear somewhat irrelevant. The chapter on education and Americanization is marred by
                    faulty reasoning and the fact that the schooling described could have affected only a very small <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-083-2-108"/> proportion of the Democratic voters of the mid-1960s. However,
                    the parts of the book dealing with Douglas's conservative naturalism, the minstrel show and
                    racism, and the rituals involved in political campaigns and voting are remarkably informative and
                    perspicacious. In short, this book is remarkably uneven, but it best parts deserve the attention of
                    anyone seriously interested in midnineteenth-century American politics and political culture. <hi rend="i">Thomas E. Rodgers, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    impulsive man driven to understand the encounter of society with nature and the contrast of
                    civilization and wilderness that was part of the westward movement of early nineteenth-century
                    America. His life in the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> valley and elsewhere was one of struggle
                    and achievement and makes for captivating reading. Audubon's own writings, as gathered by
                    Scott Russell Sanders, are powerfully evocative of time and place, as in Audubon's account
                    of his flatboat journey from <placeName>
