            ALLEN SAFIANOW
            In the summer of 1995 
                        Noblesville
                    , Indiana, site of the sensational 1925 homicide trial of Ku Klux Klan leader D. C.
                    Stephenson, again drew national attention after the discovery of Klan records dating back to the
                    1920s. In March, Don Roberts, a local building contractor, chanced upon a trunk in the barn of a
                    property he had recently acquired. The trunk contained over one thousand membership cards and dues
                    receipts revealing the names of 
                        Hamilton County
                     "citizens" of klavern #42 of the Indiana realm of the Invisible
                    Empire of the Ku Klux Klan. Hoods, sashes, and an eighteen–inch electric cross were also
                    among the contents. After rejecting an offer from a private collector, Roberts decided to donate all
                    the Klan material to the 
                        Hamilton County
                     Historical Society.1 While recognizing that exposure of the
                    members' names might pain descendents,

                    Daily Ledger columnist Gregg 
                        Montgomery
                     called for access to the records, a view endorsed shortly after by an editorial in the
                    same newspaper arguing that the Klan records were "a part of the Hoosier state's
                    social quilt."2 At its regular bimonthly meeting in July, the
                    historical society's board of directors voted unanimously to accept Roberts's
                    donation. At the same time it established the policy that the Klan records would not be placed on
                    public display, with access limited to genealogical or scholarly purposes. Curious individuals could
                    inquire whether specific relatives' names appeared in the records, but names could not be
                    published without consent of both the society and the individual's
                        de–scendents.3
            
            The discovery of the Klan records, and the issue of what would be done with them, precipitated a wave
                    of media attention that astounded residents of this county seat located ten miles northeast of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The story was featured on Indiana television news broadcasts and was circulated across
                    the country by the Associated Press. Feature stories in the nation's leading newspapers
                    included local residents' comments on the town's prior record of discrimination.
                    The revelation of these Klan records, wrote Dirk Johnson of the 
                        New York
                    
                    Times, "has forced this upscale city of 20,000 people … to
                    confront its racist past." Judy Pasternak of the 
                        Los Angeles
                     Times, in an article entitled "Trunk Opens Up Indiana Town's Secret
                    Klan Past," cited Don Roberts's comment that the local Klan's ranks
                    included "pillars of the community." The articles by Pasternak and Johnson
                    provided platforms for critics of the decision not to publicize names. Stephenson biographer William
                    Lutholtz, historian Nancy McLean, and John W. Jarrett of the NAACP in nearby Anderson, Indiana,
                    argued the historical and social benefits of full disclosure. Sam H.Jones, president of the Urban
                    League of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , argued against the decision to limit access to scholars: "History is very
                    important to me. It helps me to understand the past and to chart future directions. The Klan is very
                    much alive in Indiana, so it would be important to know more about its roots."

                                Noblesville
                            , Indiana, July 7, 2000.
               
                     David Heighway then director of the county historical society,
                    defended the board's decision. He explained, "If it had been 10 more years, there
                    wouldn't have been any problem at all. … The local community is really important
                    to us. We don't want to offend them."4
            
            For a time, Heighway, Roberts, and Burgess were deluged with telephone calls from reporters and
                    others. Newsweek entered die fray when its "Perspective" column
                    featured a statement by Burgess describing the men he had personally known whose names appeared on
                    the Klan rosters as "fine, decent people." The magazine misrepresented his words
                    as a cumulative assessment of all those who were listed on "the town's
                    70–year–old Ku Klux Klan membership rolls." Some residents were
                    bewildered by the attention; one historical society board member couldn't understand
                    "all the hullabaloo. … The media has their way of blowing things out of all
                        proportion."5 Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that some of
                    Roberts's friends inquired why he had not simply burned the records. Several years later
                    Roberts reflected, "Well, you can't burn history, you know. That's what
                    is wrong today. Too many people are trying to bury history, and history is history. You may have
                    liked to change it, but it's gone, it's behind us."6
            
            Fortunately, Roberts did not attempt to "burn history," and the
                    Nobles–ville Klan records will be preserved as a valuable resource for those seeking a
                    better understanding of the operations of the Hoosier "Invisible Empire." While
                    the commotion over the records' discovery soon subsided, and only a few residents have
                    inquired into their ancestors' possible membership,7 the Klan, as
                    Roberts recognized, is a part—though not a welcome one—of
                    the town's history. Heighway acknowledged to the 
                        New York
                    
                    Times that the discovery of the Klan records "meant some embarrassment,
                    some shame, for our community. … This is not a proud moment for us."8

            Historian Carl Becker observed many years ago that history, as we grapple with it, is "the
                        memory of things said and done."9 What we
                    "know" and remember about the past may be very different from what actually
                    happened, particularly if the subject is, in retrospect, an unpleasant one. This article explores
                    what we might learn today about the 
                        Noblesville
                     Klan of the 1920s, utilizing not just the newly discovered records, but local histories
                    and official accounts, personal recollections, and contemporary press accounts. It examines as well
                    how the community has "constructed" its historical understanding of its
                    involvement with the Klan. It addresses the sensitive issue of how a community deals with the fact
                    that its most respected citizens, its esteemed forefathers, embraced an organization which now is
                    commonly regarded as an anathema, a gross antithesis of the fundamental ideals of this nation.
            While the community's embarrassment and regret over its Klan past appears genuine, there has
                    been difficulty in coming to grips with some of the more disturbing implications of the
                    organization's overwhelming, if relatively brief, appeal in 
                        Hamilton County
                     The article also considers how the discovery of the Klan records has become part of the
                    process by which a community has been compelled to reexamine and even possibly redefine its sense of
                    community as well as its history.
            Considerable debate exists within the historical profession over the significance of the Klu Klux
                    Klan movement, given its multiple and diverse manifestations in this nation over the past century
                    and a half. Popular readings tend to blur together the massive movement of the 1920s, the earlier
                    post–Civil War Klan that challenged radical Reconstruction, and the later multitude of
                    splinter groups that appropriated the Klan name in vicious endeavors to undermine the civil rights
                    movement of the 1960s and to vilify a broad array of minority groups. Among historians who
                    distinguish these phases from one another, disagreements nevertheless remain. The orthodox view of
                    the 1920s Klan as a nativist, racist, and sometimes violent movement, centered in rural or small
                    town America,10

                     has been challenged over the past few decades by revisionist
                    studies that have noted the strength of the movement in urban areas and its complex regional
                    variations. Revisionists have suggested that authentic social, political, and economic problems,
                    including corruption, vice, and the trampling of Prohibition, played a larger role in stimulating
                    Klan support than did ethnic, racial, or religious tensions, although such tensions were often
                    entwined with the other issues. Demographic analysis of Klan membership has revealed that, rather
                    than coming from marginal economic groups as earlier studies had suggested, citizens of the
                    Invisible Empire came mostly from the economic and social mainstream of American life. These
                    individuals, revisionists contended, could not be dismissed as irrational or paranoid, and their
                    propensity towards violence had been greatly exaggerated.11 Yet there are
                    contemporary scholars, including Nancy MacLean, who seem unconvinced by these revisionist arguments
                    and continue to focus on the nativist and racist aspects of the movement while at the same time
                    exploring additional ideological and gender issues.12 Thus if residents of 
                        Noblesville
                     today are somewhat at a loss to explain the meaning of the strange happenings in their
                    community three–quarters of a century ago, it is only fair to point out that historians,
                    too, have failed to reach a firm consensus about the Klan's role in American history.

                    At its height in the 1920s, one–quarter to one–third of native–born

                        Hamilton County
                    , with an estimated 35 percent in 1925, was one of the strongest Klan bastions in
                        Indiana.13 In its earlier history, however, the county (organized in 1823)
                    had provided noteworthy examples of tolerance—episodes

                     celebrated in its local histories and official publications.14 George Boxley, a one–time slave owner who fled 
                        Virginia
                     after being arrested and indicted for his alleged role in organizing a slave
                    insurrection, arrived in 
                        Hamilton County
                     in 1828 and established the small community of Boxley, where he conducted a free school
                    in his log cabin home and, according to some accounts, continued to disseminate his strong
                    abolitionist message.15 Quakers had a sizeable presence in the county,
                    particularly in the western townships and in the town of 
                        Westfield
                    , and some were active in the underground railroad. The "colored" of 
                        Westfield
                    , one local historian reported at the beginning of the twentieth century, had been
                    treated with a "near equality."16 County residents have taken
                    special pride in the Roberts Settlement in Jackson Township several miles north of 
                        Noblesville
                    , founded by free blacks from 
                        North Carolina
                     in 1837. Although it attained a population of over 400, the settlement, like other
                    rural African–American communities in Indiana, gradually disappeared in the twentieth
                    century as new generations left to find economic opportunities in larger towns and cities. Many who
                    were raised there, like Carl D. Roberts, a 
                        Chicago
                     surgeon, and Ezra Roberts, head of the education department of Tuskegee Institute, went
                    on to distinguish themselves professionally.17 To this day,

                            provide idealized and sometimes erroneous accounts. For example, there is the claim that 
                                Noblesville
                            , rather than neighboring 
                                Madison County
                            , was the site of the trial which led to the hanging of three settlers convicted
                            for their role in the 1824 
                                Fall Creek

                            slaughtered—reportedly the first time whites had been convicted and executed for

                     large numbers of community descendents gather for annual
                    reunions where they provide testimonials to the area's racial harmony.18
            
            Yet there were racial tensions, not so much heralded in the local histories. Even
                    nineteenth–century Quakers were sharply divided on the issues of abolition, the
                    underground railroad, and racial equality. George Levi 
                        Knox
                    , who escaped bondage by fleeing behind Union lines in 1863, was nearly run out of town
                    when he visited Boxley the following year. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries patterns of
                    racial discrimination, including exclusion from the public swimming pool and local restaurants, and
                    segregated seating in theaters, existed in 
                        Hamilton County
                     as they did throughout the state. Few aliens or Roman Catholics resided in the county.
                    One small German–Catholic church had been established in the town of Cicero, early in the
                    county's history; a Catholic mission in 
                        Noblesville
                     to minister to immigrant workers attracted by the
                    late–nineteenth–century gas boom shut down in 1904, after the boom ended. If
                    Catholics were not numerous enough to exert much influence or generate extreme forms of
                    anti–Catholicism, sermons delivered in local Protestant churches reflected common biases
                    against 
                        Rome
                     and its hierarchy. Moreover, the First World War unleashed a loyalty campaign marked by
                    suspicion of German Americans and others who were deemed less than "100%
                        American."19
            
            The Klan movement which took root in Indiana during the twenties fed upon these racial, religious,
                    and ethnic tensions. In 1920 Joseph Huffington, the first representative of a small, 
                        Georgia
                    –based revival of the Klan, arrived in 
                        Evansville
                    , Indiana, and agents began soliciting members in the southern counties of the state. In
                    1922 Q. C. Stephenson, who had worked with Huffington in 
                        Evansville
                    , moved the recruiting effort northward to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and Klan representatives spread out statewide in a massively successful membership
                    drive. As numbers increased, so did Stephenson's power in the statewide organization. From
                    July 1922 through

                            about Klan activities in the county during his boyhood in the 1920s replied, "I
                            didn't know a thing about them back then. Never gave us any trouble."

                        Cross still exist.21 These sources make it apparent that, regardless of
                    the diverse motives that might have led individuals to join the organization, the Klan's
                    stance on issues such as race, religion, and immigration should have been common knowledge from the
                    onset. Without some local foundation of racism, religious prejudice, and nativism, therefore, it is
                    unlikely that an organization such as the Klan could have attained a high level of support. A good
                    deal of press coverage accompanied the Indiana Klan's efforts in late 1922 and early 1923
                    to launch a klavern in 
                        Hamilton County
                    . Klan demonstrations, parades, cross burnings, and extravagantly ritualized funeral

                        Hamilton County
                     quickly became explicit about its ideology Charles Orbison, a former Democratic

                    radical from the country and for stricter immigration laws, "laws that make Castle
                    Garden's gates swing with more difficulty inwardly and more easily outward."23 The following Sunday, the Reverend A. H. Moore, who would eventually be
                    identified publicly as a local Klan leader, gave an evening sermon at his First Christian Church
                    entitled, "Is the Ku Klux Klan a Menace to America?" The Ledger,
                    on its front page, reported that this was the largest church gathering that had taken place in 
                        Noblesville

                     time, with several hundred people being turned away. The paper
                    concluded that "the theme of the discourse was either of wide interest to the general
                    public or there must have been a thousand members or more of the organization in this locality who
                    desired to hear something said in public about the workings of the invisible empire."
                    Mincing few words, Moore proclaimed the need for Protestant Americans to have their own
                    organization. The foreign element, he announced, posed a threat to the enforcement of the Eighteenth
                    Amendment, and the preacher referred to the "poison in the melting pot." He stated
                    that the Klansmen believed "that every colored person should keep his place," and
                    warned against the danger of racial intermarriage. He deplored the Jew who failed to accept Christ
                    and who "holds the dime so close to his eye that he cannot see the dollar beyond."
                    It would be unwise, he continued, "to allow the Jewish element to control the finances of
                    the 
                        United States
                    ." Although the pastor insisted that he held no malice towards Catholics, he
                    suggested that they held a disproportionate number of government appointments and that they failed
                    to respect the principle of the separation of church and state. Catholics, he maintained,
                    "cannot continue allegiance to the Pope of 
                        Rome
                     and still be loyal to the institutions of America." In his conclusion, Moore
                    pointed to the charitable efforts of the Klan, asked God to bless "every Ku Kluxer who may
                    be under the sound of my voice," and declared, "I would rather wear a white sheet
                    in the dark than to see my country in a shroud."24
            
            In early February, in the midst of a revival service at First Christian, eight robed men presented
                    Moore with a $40 personal gift, as well as a letter listing the Klan's
                    principles. These, as reported in the Ledger, included the tenets of Christianity,
                    white supremacy, separation of church and state, the limitation of foreign immigration, and
                    protection of the public school system.25 The newspaper, which a week earlier
                    had observed that the Klan appeared to be "growing by leaps and bounds in 
                        Hamilton
                     county," remarked that "[i]t was an impressively religious sight to
                    see the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan kneeling in prayer before the pulpit last night. It is difficult
                    to find fault with the principles expressed in the letter to Rev. Moore."26 A few days later, Moore proclaimed that the power of the

                     Vatican had overshadowed the supremacy of Jesus.27 The popularity of the church and its pastor soared. During a three–week
                    revival, the church gained 58 new members, making a total of 327 additions since Moore had assumed
                    his pastorate two years earlier.28 By the year's end, the pastor could
                    boast that First Christian had the largest Sunday school attendance and church membership (some 900
                    individuals) in the county29
            
            Klan membership mushroomed as well. The editors of the Fiery Cross took delight in
                    discussing the inroads made in 
                        Hamilton County
                    ,30 and 
                        Noblesville
                     resounded with nativist rhetoric for the next few years. In March 1923 Rev. Williams, a
                    Baptist pastor from a church in the northeast corner of the county, disclosed his Klan membership to
                    a full house at 
                        Noblesville
                    's Olympic theatre and told his applauding audience, ironically paraphrasing
                    Lincoln, that the nation could no longer continue to be half American and half foreign.31 On June 30, the Klan conducted its largest gathering yet in 
                        Hamilton County
                    , with a crowd estimated at 10,000 to 12,000 assembling in 
                        Noblesville
                    , although the Ledger still coyly observed that there were no
                    recognizable local Klansmen in the parade. But some 20 to 25 local Klansmen were deputized to help
                    keep order; over 200 candidates were initiated into the town's klavern; businesses and
                    homes were decorated with American flags; and a "flaming fiery cross on the dome of the
                    court house attracted a great deal of attention." Banners proclaimed "We Are Pure
                    Americans," "White Supremacy," and "We Favor a Limitation on
                    Immigration." One local Klansman informed the press that the organization had acquired
                    about 1,000 members in 
                        Noblesville
                     and about 2,400 members throughout the county.32

                            minister's full name. Interestingly this Klan account uses language very similar to
                            the language used by the Ledger when it described the great turnout for
                            the Reverend Moore's presentation in January, "Is the Klan a Menace to
                            America?" The large response at the Olympic theater, The Fiery Cross observed, demonstrated that either "there is a very large membership of
                            the organization in this locality or a large number of people are indirectly interested in
                            the teachings of the organization. …"

                     a Baptist minister insisted that "colored
                    people," Catholics, andjews were not as well qualified to conduct the government as were
                    "100% Americans." In November a large delegation of Klansmen assembled
                    at Cicero's Christian Church heard Rev. E. E. Kuhn inform them that the struggle against
                    the evil force of the papacy still continued.33 At a gathering held in December
                    at the Red Men's Hall (the regular meeting place for the 
                        Noblesville
                     Klan), Rev. Percy James, after insisting that the Klan was not anti–Jew,
                    anti–Catholic, or anti–Negro, called for eliminating parochial schools,
                    placing Protestant Bibles in every public school, tightening immigration laws, and extending the
                    time barrier for the eligibility of naturalized citizens to vote.34 In May 1925,
                    the Ledger ran an advertisement that Helen Jackson, an "Escaped and
                    Converted Nun," would give three presentations at the Olympic Theatre. The Invisible Empire
                    paraded Jackson, whose autobiography, Content Cruelties, was a staple at Klan
                    rallies, across the country where she graphically recounted lurid tales of atrocities committed in
                    Roman Catholic convents, including torture, enslavement, and the infanticide of the illegitimate
                    offspring of nuns and priests.35
            
            In April 1925 scandal erupted around the Indiana Klan, centered on the person of D. C. Stephenson.
                    Although he was no longer Grand Dragon, the public still associated Stephenson with the state
                    organization at the time that he was arrested for the rape and murder of Madge Oberholtzer, a young
                    state government employee. Stephenson was charged with having brutally assaulted the young woman on
                    a train to 
                        Chicago
                    ; Oberholtzer attempted suicide by swallowing mercury bichloride tablets at a 
                        Hammond
                    , Indiana, hotel after the rape but died several weeks later at her 
                        Indianapolis
                     home, having signed an affidavit graphically detailing Stephenson's brutality.
                    Stephenson was already hated by opponents of the Klan; his arrogance, greed, and
                    power–grabbing had lost him many supporters within the organization as well. Newspapers
                    turned the story into a sensation. The trial was moved from 
                        Marion County
                    , where the defendant and his

            As preparations for the trial began in June, the Ledger began to publish, on virtually a daily basis,
                    an unsigned front–page column entitled "Klan Komment," which sought to
                    clarify the organization's objectives. The column, which ran for several months, compared
                    the Klan to fraternal organizations such as the Masons, Odd Fellows, and Elks, but it also spelled
                    out in very clear terms the organization's support of white supremacy, racial purity,
                    prohibition enforcement, separation of church and state, and immigration restriction.37 It expressed alarm at the number of Roman Catholic federal employees and concluded that
                    "there are nations and races that can never by any process of education or assimilation
                    become Americanized, and we have determined that the time shall come when there will be no place in
                    America for people who cannot think in terms of Americanism."38 The
                    enemies of the Klan were described as "the measly, motley mob of misfits," and
                    readers were queried as to whether they preferred to be controlled by native–born white
                    Protestants of good character, or by foreigners, criminals, and degenerates.39
            
            The discovered Klan records do not contain the names of the Ledger's editor and manager
                    (Edward E. Neal and Charles S. Neal), but the Neals's paper often appeared to endorse Klan
                    activities and strongly echoed Klan sentiments regarding aliens and prohibition. Editorials
                    expressed little hope that undesirable immigrants from southern Europe could be assimilated.40 These people were not only the prime violators of prohibition but were the
                    nation's most egregious criminals. "Too many people," one editorial
                    complained, "get into Uncle Sam's land who have no right here and who have no
                    regard for any laws, human or divine. It is these men and women who come, not being properly
                    scrutiniz'ed, and they form the rum–running, hi–jacking bands, the
                    gunmen, the gangs of bandits and murderers which infect the big cities and even now get out into the
                        country."41 Governor

                     Al Smith of 
                        New York
                     was a particular target of the paper, which attacked his stance on prohibition, his
                    ties with aliens and Tammany Hall, and his presidential aspirations. The Ledger
                    insisted that the candidate's Roman Catholic faith was not an issue, but it nonetheless
                    endorsed evangelist Billy Sunday's assertion that the governor had no more chance of being
                    elected President than the Pope of 
                        Rome
                     had of being made Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.42
            
            While it is easy enough to find in the press numerous expressions of racist and nativist sentiment,
                    it is more difficult to assess the impact such pronouncements might have had on minorities. In
                    Indiana, as elsewhere, the Klan promoted a TWK (Trade with a Klansman) campaign in which Klansmen
                    were urged to patronize the businesses of fellow Klansmen and to boycott Jewish and Catholic
                    enterprises. Leonard J. Moore, in his detailed revisionist study on the Indiana Klan, Citizen Klansmen, contends that the campaign had "little effect," and
                    was largely a sales–promotion effort for those who purchased advertising in the Fiery Cross.43 In any case, the Ledger published
                    not only Rev. Moore's denunciation of Jewish economic influence but his plea to his 
                        Noblesville
                     audience that it "trade at home."44 During the
                    years 1923 and 1924 the Fiery Cross included the names of more than twenty 
                        Noblesville
                     enterprises—–groceries, garages, drug stores, and
                    undertakers—in its advertisements. Among these, ironically, was the "Finest
                    Little Candy Kitchen," operated by Greek–born George Kosto. The store's
                    name had originally been "Kosto's Kandy Kitchen" but was changed,
                    reportedly due to the objections of the local klavern, which apparently wanted to maintain its
                    monopoly over triple Ks.45 Ineligible for Klan membership himself because of his
                    immigrant status, Kosto perhaps felt it wise, due to economic and social pressures, not to alienate
                    his Klan neighbors.
            Personal recollections provide another source of information concerning Klan intimidation, although
                    such testimonies must be viewed cautiously. In 1995, Bud Costomiris related to 
                        Los Angeles
                     Times reporter Judy Pasternak the story of his father, Sam, who purchased
                    Kosto's confectionary

                        Connecticut
                    , Sam informed Bud that his departure had been prompted by Klan "calling
                    cards," including a dead raccoon and a dead groundhog. Pasternak also spoke with
                    eighty–five–year–old Fanny Glover, whose uncle, Andrew Lucas, had
                    worked for Craycraft Dry Goods. The Klan invited the Craycraft brothers to join under the condition
                    that they fire their black employee, which they refused to do.46 In more recent

                     interviews conducted in conjunction with this study, Joseph
                    Roberts indicated that he had heard of at least one Jewish businessman who had encountered
                    difficulties during the Klan years, and Don Roberts stated that he had heard of Klan–led
                    boycotts against Catholics but knew of no Catholic–owned businesses that operated at that
                    time. Most other interviewees who had some familiarity with local history and Klan activities had no
                    knowledge of such boycotts in 
                        Noblesville
                    .47
            
            Not surprisingly, little was said in the press about more physical forms of intimidation, although in
                    September 1921 the Ledger reported the arrival of the Horse Thief Detective
                    Association in northern 
                        Hamilton County
                    . Within a few years the association had nine or ten companies operating throughout the
                    county, with as many as 600 members.48 The organizations roots went back to an
                    1865 Indiana law that permitted the creation of volunteer constabularies for the purpose of
                    apprehending horse thieves and similar felons. The moribund associations were revived during the
                    1920s and were commonly regarded as the enforcement arm of the Indiana Klan, with a considerable
                    overlap in membership. The connection was occasionally alluded to in the 
                        Noblesville
                     press. The association most frequently targeted bootleggers, gambling establishments,
                    and other moral transgressors,49 but there is no definite evidence that it was
                    used in 
                        Hamilton County
                     to intimidate minorities per se.30 The Ledger
                    occasionally referred to association meetings throughout the county but said little about what they
                    actually did.51 The only reference to any racial or ethnic 
                  
                     47 Joseph G. Roberts and Don Roberts interviews. One Jewish resident
                            of 
                                Noblesville
                             did not know of any problem with the Klan encountered by his father, a clothing
                            merchant, or by other Jewish business owners. Samuel Zeckel, telephone interview with
                            author, July 13, 2000. County historian Joe Burgess was unaware of any Klan boycotts
                            implemented against Catholics or Jews. In 1927 a controversy did erupt when Maurice
                            Bernheimer, a Jewish resident of 
                                Crawfordsville
                            , leased the

                             Opera House to show films on Sunday; objections were raised by the Ministerial
                            Association, and ultimately Bernheimer was fined $25 for showing a film without
                            the proper license. Daily Ledger, September 17, 1927, 1; September 19,

                     physical intimidation came in a January 1924 article reporting
                    how mysterious "night riders" in Sheridan, perturbed by an Asian
                    immigrant's supposed dishonorable conduct, "made the Chinaman, Smiley Sue, feel so
                    unwelcome that he left town and in all probability will never return."52
            
            Contemporary newspapers do provide more information about Klan charitable and civic endeavors. As the
                    organization sought to gain a foothold in the county, the Ledger's
                    frequent articles about Klan donations to county churches and others in need undoubtedly enhanced
                    its philanthropic image.53 Thus those who defended their connections with the
                    Klan by pointing to its benevolent works were not entirely disingenuous. Revisionist studies have
                    tended to stress that in many regions local klaverns seemed more preoccupied with addressing
                    legitimate social and moral reforms than in harassing minority groups. Leonard Moore, for example,
                    maintains that this movement is "best understood not as a nativist organization
                    … but rather as a populist organization," and he contends that Indiana Klansmen
                    were predominantly concerned with socio–political issues such as prohibition enforcement
                    and eliminating vice and political corruption.54 While evidence suggests that
                    Moore might have underestimated the significance of the Klan's nativism in places such as 
                        Hamilton County
                    , the "populist" features of the movement were certainly present (if
                    more vaguely defined than in areas like 
                        Tipton
                     and Howard counties to the north).55 During the 1920s the county
                    was the site of a well–publicized effort to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment and to
                    eliminate illegal gambling, and articles appearing in the Fiery Cross claimed that
                    the Klan played an active role in bringing violators to justice.36 The Ledger, while anxious to give the impression that vice was being vigorously
                    suppressed through raids and judicial action, provided little information as to how much the Klan
                    contributed to this effort beyond its staunch public opposition. However, Rev. Moore, who emerged as
                    the leading public spokes–person

                     Klan and served as its Kludd (chaplain), played a prominent public role in supporting
                    anti–vice efforts in general as well as Sunday blue laws through other organizations such
                    as the

            In a number of communities the women's Klan organizations were openly associated with moral
                    and political reform efforts,58 but in the case of 
                        Hamilton County
                     their role, like that of their male counterparts, was relatively muted. The Queens of
                    the Golden Mask, a forerunner of the Women of the Ku Klux Klan, made their first public appearance
                    in 
                        Noblesville
                     in June 1923. Eventually four women's chapters operated in 
                        Hamilton County
                    , but their public role seems to have been limited to activities such as participating
                    in meetings and parades, distributing Bibles to school children, and conducting funeral rites for
                    deceased members.59
            
            Newspaper accounts reveal that the 
                        Hamilton County
                     Klan maintained its visibility in a variety of ways. In the summer of 1923 it sponsored
                    memorial services across the county upon the death of President Harding.60 The
                    next year Klan–produced motion pictures such as The Traitor Within and
                        The Toll of Justice were shown at the American Theatre in downtown 
                        Noblesville
                    , followed by the screening of D. W. Griffith's 1915 The Birth of
                        a Nation, which romanticized the exploits of the original post–Civil War
                        Klan.61 Perhaps the 
                        Hamilton County
                     Klan's most ambitious promotional endeavor was its 1925 sponsorship of a Klan
                    day at the annual summer chautauqua. Just a few days before the chautauqua, the Ledger announced that the final day of the event would be observed as "Klan
                    Day," with special speakers, including Judge Orbison and Imperial Wizard Hiram Evans, the
                    highest–ranking figure in the national Klan. In frontpage stories, the newspaper
                    forecasted the largest gathering ever assembled in 
                        Noblesville
                    , with Hoosier Klansmen being joined by delegations from

                    plans to reroute traffic, ban parking on a major thoroughfare, and provide additional bus
                    transportation, all in anticipation of record crowds.62

                        promote a Klan event.
            
            
            In the end, however, Klan Day was something of a disappointment. Evans did appear, having just
                    returned from the infamous 
                        Washington, D.C.
                    , Klan parade, in which forty thousand robed men and women marched down 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Avenue, with the domed Capitol in the background.63 His address was
                    biting, praising the recently passed National Origins Act, which sharply restricted the immigration
                    of certain national and ethnic groups, for building "a stone wall around the nation so
                    tall, so deep and so strong that the scum and riff–raff of the old world cannot get into
                    our gates," and arguing that "the colored man" should be "kept
                    in his place." Yet there was also an element of defensiveness in Evans's remarks
                    as he refuted news accounts that the Klan was declining in the wake of the Stephenson scandal.
                    "If the Klan is dead," he replied, "then America is dead."
                    Moreover, one of the scheduled featured speakers, Robbie Gill, head of the national Women of the Ku
                    Klux Klan, failed to appear. The Ledger, which in the past had boosted the Klan
                    with accounts of large crowds, uncharacteristically said nothing about overall attendance at Klan
                    Day other than to mention that the last session, an address by Judge Orbison on the need to more
                    thoroughly Americanize the nation's schools, was well attended "despite the rain
                    in the late afternoon." (Three years after the event, however, the Ledger
                    reported that its files revealed that only several hundred had attended the Klan Day meeting). The
                    paper did note that the Chautauqua Association's largest single source of income that year
                    was the local Klan's agreed contribution of $1,250, but added that the
                    chautauqua's board of directors, the evening before Klan Day, had decided "not to
                    turn next year's program over to any organization." The board, the Ledger reported, announced that the 1926 event would be "strictly a community
                    affair to which every organization of every kind will be invited. A better and a big'ger
                    program in every way is promised next year."64 As the 1926 chautauqua
                    approached, the board solicited the support of the "entire community," and made no
                    mention of any special role for the Klan. The event was such a failure that there was some doubt as
                    to whether a chautauqua would take place in 1927.65
            
            It is the Stephenson trial, more than any other event, that has most identified the town of 
                        Noblesville
                    —in history books, in the press, in popular memory, and even on
                    television—with the Klan.66 Indeed, preparations

                     for the trial were underway, and Stephenson was incarcerated in
                    the old county jail in the town square, as the 1925 chautauqua was taking place. What is sometimes
                    overlooked is that by then Stephenson, often credited with building the Indiana Klan into a potent
                    force, had broken with the Evans organization. Just a few months after Stephenson's
                    dramatic installation as Grand Dragon in 
                        Kokomo
                     on July 4, 1923, he had stepped down from his official position because of
                    disagreements with the national leadership. Evans had refused to provide financial support for
                    Stephenson's efforts to take over 
                        Valparaiso
                     University and convert it into the "Klan's 
                        Harvard
                    ." Stephenson was also upset by the Evans organization's propensity
                    towards violence and its failure to map out a coherent national political program. In the spring of
                    1924, well before the Oberholtzer affair, Stephenson was officially banished from the Evans Klan
                    amidst charges of drunkenness and womanizing, with Walter Bossert succeeding him as Grand Dragon.
                    Stephenson assumed leadership over an autonomous Klan group, and Hoosier klandom was in effect split
                    into two warring organizations.67 A significant number of 
                        Noblesville
                     Klansmen appear to have supported Bossert's faction.68
                    Moreover, the Ledger reported that John Sperry (exalted cyclops or head of the 
                        Noblesville
                     klavern) presided over the Klan Day events.69 Thus the significance
                    of the trial and its outcome are more complex and ambiguous than is sometimes realized.
            Despite the change of venue, some commentators expressed doubt as to whether a fair procedure could
                    take place in a Klan–ridden community such as 
                        Noblesville

                    Judge Fred Hines, who had been less than pleased when the controversial case had been remanded to
                    his court, was met with an outburst of applause and cheers by the crowd in the packed courthouse
                    when he denied bail for Stephenson.71 After the defense filed a request for a
                    change of judge on grounds of bias, the apparently relieved Hines stepped down. His replacement was
                    Judge Will Sparks of the 
                        Rush County
                     Circuit Court. No friend of the Klan, Sparks reportedly refused his Catholic
                    secretary's offer to resign when he ran for reelection, maintaining that the race would not
                    be worth winning if he lost because of her religion.72
            
            County Sheriff Charles W. Gooding was perhaps another matter. William H. Remy, the
                    anti–Klan Republican 
                        Marion County
                     prosecutor who played a key role in Stephenson's indictment and continued to
                    lead the prosecution after the trial was transferred to 
                        Hamilton County
                    , was certain the sheriff was a Klansman.73 Years later Gooding
                    provided an affidavit in support of Stephenson's unsuccessful effort to win an appeal.74 At the time of the trial itself the sheriff and his wife had befriended
                    Stephenson, who was housed in the small county jail adjacent to the courthouse (also the
                    sheriff's residence). Stephenson was fed home–cooked meals and was given
                    virtually free run of the facility. He entertained a steady flow of visitors in the evening and was
                    permitted gifts that included money and confiscated bootleg liquor. John Niblack, who covered the
                    trial as a reporter for the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Times, claimed that Gooding became so attached to his prisoner that he shed tears
                    when, following the guilty verdict, Stephenson was removed from the county jail for incarceration in 
                        Michigan
                     City. There was also an allegation that Stephenson, to demonstrate his gratitude, gave
                    the sheriff a large sum of money.75
            
            Despite the kind treatment he may have received from Sheriff Gooding,

                Stephenson did not regard 
                        Noblesville
                    's climate as hospitable for the trial. He reportedly had been vilified at
                    meetings of the Evans–dominated 
                        Hamilton County
                     Klan,76 and after his conviction Stephenson repeatedly claimed that
                    the chautauqua Klan Day had been orchestrated by the Evans–Bossert faction to turn public
                    sentiment in the county against him. He accused Evans and his supporters of circulating anonymous
                    literature throughout the county attacking his character and claimed masked klans–men
                    gathered beneath the outside window of his cell, threatening to kill him if he revealed Klan
                    interest in his conviction. He would ultimately claim that threats such as these were what prevented
                    him from testifying in his own behalf at his trial. Upon his conviction, Stephenson informed the
                    press that the verdict was the result of political persecution. Half of those who filled the
                    176–seat courtroom, he alleged, were there to prejudice his case. In a statement to Judge

                     he denied that he was guilty of murder and insisted that
                    hissing and other disruptive demonstrations in the courtroom—not, in his words, from 
                        Hamilton County
                     residents but "from the scum and scurvy of the whole state of
                    Indiana"—prevented a fair trial. For many years thereafter Stephenson, who was
                    sentenced to life, repeated his charges and sought unsuccessfully to win an appeal.77 His claims were, of course, self–serving, but the Evans Klan seems to have had
                    good cause in wishing Stephenson good riddance. Soon after the conviction, the secretary of 
                        Elkhart County
                     Klan No. 77 publicly expressed "gratitude and sincere appreciation"
                    to the judge, jury, and attorneys responsible for putting Stephenson away.78
            
            The legal merit of Stephenson's conviction has generated considerable debate over the years,
                    but the 
                        Noblesville
                     jury's decision has been hailed, not just by the people of 
                        Hamilton County
                     but in well–regarded American history textbooks, as a major contributor to
                    the ultimate collapse of the Klan.79 County prosecutor Justin Roberts, years
                    later, recalled the quest to fill the jury with "honest people who had nothing to do with
                    the Klan." In his unpublished memoirs, William Remy said he was informed by Ralph K. Kane,
                    the 
                        Hamilton County
                     assistant prosecutor who assisted the state in jury selection, that most of those
                    ultimately selected to serve were Klan members, but nonetheless honest individuals who could render
                    a fair verdict.80 The available county Klan records partially confirm this: they
                    contain the names of at least three jurors. It would appear that in view of the divisions within the
                    organization, and the many possible reasons for joining, Klan membership alone would not necessarily
                    have determined personal sympathies in the Stephenson case. Press accounts and personal
                    recollections, as subjective and inexact as they might be, give some feel for what was happening in 
                        Noblesville
                     during the 1920s.81 Extant Klan records can expand historical
                    understanding even further, although this type of source has its own limitations.
            
               
                  77 Among the charges Stephenson would later make was that Robert McNay, a
                        high–ranking state Klan officer, and others had visited him at the 
                            Noblesville
                         jail and threatened to kill him if he testified in his own behalf or revealed the
                        Klan conspiracy against him. Stephenson biographer William Lutholtz believes that Stephenson did
                        not testify during the trial because his lawyers feared a damaging cross–examination
                        by the prosecution.

            The documents discovered in 1995 are not the only relevant records available to scholars interested
                    in researching the 
                        Hamilton County
                     Klan. Another useful source is the Klan report, "Ku Klux Klan, Local Officers,
                    Indiana Records, 1925," the result of a request by Grand Dragon Bossert that Indiana
                    klaverns provide current membership figures in the wake of the damage created by the Stephenson
                    trial. Harold Feightner, a reporter for the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News, obtained a copy from a state Klan official, and many years later, in 1965,
                    donated the document to the Indiana Historical Society. The report includes membership figures as
                    well as a list of all local Klan officers for all but three Indiana counties. 
                        Hamilton County
                     Klan #42, headquartered in 
                        Noblesville
                    , is reported as having a membership of 2,461 in 1925, while a separate unit in the town
                    of Arcadia, a few miles to the north, claimed 150 members, for a total of 2,611 in 
                        Hamilton County
                    .82 As Leonard Moore has suggested, there is reason to believe that
                    the 1925 figures fall considerably short of the peak strength that the Klan had attained a year or
                    two earlier. On the basis of the 1925 figures, some 35.4 percent of the native–born white
                    adult males of the county were members at that time. Thus 
                        Hamilton County
                     ranked second in the state behind White County with 37.7 percent. (Indiana 's
                    overall percentage was 20.8).83 The homogeneous demographics of north central
                    Indiana underscore that a sizeable minority population was not a prerequisite for generating 
                  
                     81 Unfortunately, the 2347–page transcript of the
                            Stephenson trial is missing, and thus Lutholtz, in his detailed account, had to depend to a
                            large degree on newspaper accounts; Lutholtz, Grand Dragon, xii.

                            accurate estimate for a period in which the Indiana Klan had begun to decline from its peak
                            membership of somewhere between 200,000 to 300,000. The records were published (with

                            percentages would be somewhat rough estimates since the basis of the Indiana
                            counties' populations was the 1920 census, and the Klan membership figures are for
                            1925. Also, the census included males 21 and older in the adult category, while the Klan
                            admitted men over the age of 18 as members.
               
                     Klan membership. The 1920 census reported that 
                        Noblesville
                     had a population of 4,758 and 
                        Hamilton County
                     a population of 24,222. The county's "Negro" population of
                    464 represented less than 2 percent of the total, while only 166 county residents were classified as
                    "foreign born white."84 In 1926 there were just 94 Roman
                    Catholics reported living in the county.83 There was no Jewish community to
                    speak of, just a few families engaged in trade who appeared, at least on the surface, rather well
                    accepted. Many of these Jews eventually intermarried with gentiles; some converted to
                        Christianity.86
            
            Newspapers at the time of the 1995 discovery of the 1923–1926 Klan rolls erroneously
                    reported that these lists contained the names of 2,500 members;87 a careful
                    review indicates that there actually are far fewer. A large number of the names appear more than
                    once in the records, which include oath cards, dues stubs, lists of those who were delinquent in
                    dues payments, and those who were reinstated. An effort to eliminate all obvious duplications has
                    yielded a total of 1,164 different names (not including one which is illegible).88 Also, it is apparent that the

                            , Indiana. The number 1,164 is an estimate, since there were many misspellings
                            and typographical errors on the Klan lists, and there were a number of members who had the
                            same common names. An attempt was made to verify names by checking the addresses sometimes
                            provided in the Klan records with county directories.
               
                     Klan records that are now available are incomplete in that they
                    do not include all members' names. For example, of the 25 officials for the 
                        Hamilton County
                     and Arcadia klaverns listed in the aforementioned "Local Officers"
                    list, the names of only 7 appear in the 1923–1926 local records. Even the name of the
                    individual most publicly identified in the press as a local Klan leader, Rev. Moore, does not appear
                    in the Klan records.89
            
            The availability of both the 1920s 
                        Hamilton County
                     records and the 1925 list of Klan leaders does reveal more about the type of people who
                    joined the organization, if not about their precise motives and concerns. By examining county
                    directories, obituaries, and census records we can garner at least some information concerning the
                    ages, occupations, and backgrounds of many of these men.90
            
            In 1925, John Sperry the Exalted Cyclops of the 
                        Hamilton County
                     klavern, was a fifty–three–year–old native of the
                    county who since 1907 had operated a clothing store in 
                        Noblesville
                    .91 The klavern's secretary (Kligrapp) is simply listed in
                    the county directory as an "organizer." The Vice President (Klaliff) was a
                    resident of the small town of Sheridan. The thirty–seven–year–old
                    lecturer (Klokard) of the klavern was one of the community's most distinguished attorneys,
                    operating a legal firm that his grandfather had established before the Civil War.92 Rev. Aubrey H. Moore, the klavern's chaplain (Kludd), was the officer who was most
                    publicly identified with the Klan, his name appearing countless times in Ledger
                    accounts of the local organization's activities. Born in West 
                        Virginia
                     in 1882, he had moved to Indiana as a boy, graduated from 
                        Butler
                     University in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and held pastorates in various communities, including Arcadia, Zionsville, and 
                        Tipton
                    . He became pastor of the First Christian Church in 
                        Noblesville
                     in 1921, using his position to publicize and recruit for the Invisible Empire. He left 
                        Noblesville
                     in 1928 to assume a position in 
                        Indianapolis
                     but returned as minister of the First Christian Church in 
                  
                     89 Greenapple, D. C. Stephenson, 142. The fact that
                            Moore's name does not appear is not surprising. It was common practice to exempt
                            ministers from dues payments, because the Klan often used these individuals to recruit
                            members through their churches. See Chalmers, Hooded Americanism,

                     possibly never had a more popular pastor," the Ledger noted
                    in its obituary, and he received one of the largest funerals ever held in the city, with an overflow
                    crowd of over 800.93
            
            The klavern's treasurer (Klabee) was a fifty–five–year–old
                    former school teacher and grocer, who owned a furniture store and was selected as a trustee of the 
                        Noblesville
                     school system in 1925.94 The conductor (Kladd) was a utility
                    company employee. The inner guard (Klagaroo) worked at the Union Sanitary Company; the guard
                    (Klexter) was a thirty–seven–year–old box maker.95 The "Night Hawk," in charge of initiating candidates for membership, was
                    a prominent fifty–five–year–old funeral director who, in John E
                    Haines's History of 
                            Hamilton County
                        
                (1915), was numbered "among 
                        Hamilton County
                    's most substantial and enterprising citizens."96
                    Another prominent local resident, a fifty–three–year–old pharmacist
                    who owned his own drug store, served as a "Klokann," a member of the
                    klavern's board of investigators, auditors, and advisors.97 Another
                    Klokann was the sixty–year–old proprietor of a shoe store begun by his father
                    and uncle— one of the oldest firms in the county.98 The third Klokann
                    is simply listed in the directory as a resident of Carmel.
            The leadership profile of 
                        Hamilton County
                     Klavern #42 would appear to confirm the impression of those interviewed for this
                    project that the organization was centered in the business community. Of the ten officers for whom
                    occupational information exists, five were merchants or businessmen, one was a lawyer and another a
                    minister. The evidence suggests that they were, at least collectively, middle–aged men
                    who had attained a certain stature in their community.99 The rank and file of
                    the 
                        Noblesville
                     Klan, however, represented a significantly broader occupational distribution.

                        Noblesville
                    .101 Occupations for 374 of these individuals could be determined
                    through the county directories for 1922,1924, and 1926.102 The occupational
                    distribution broke down as seen in Table 1.
            Among the 79 found in the high white–collar group were 34 merchants, 10
                    managers, 5 lawyers, 3 physicians, 2 dentists, 2 undertakers, a 
                  
                     100 Only two members were specifically described in the directories as
                            being retired. In all probability, many of those who had no occupation listed in the
                            directories also fell into this category. The occupational categories used here are modeled
                            on those used by Stephan Thernstrom, The Other Bostonians: Poverty and Progress
                                in the American Metropolis, 1880–1970 (

                     101 Of the other members, 192 could be identified as having residences
                            in the rural areas surrounding

                                    Noblesville
                                , Indiana, 1922, 1924, 1926. These directories provide addresses for,
                            but not occupations for, county residents living outside the town of 
                                Noblesville
                            . These directories would provide more current information about occupations and
                            addresses of those listed in the 1923–1926 Klan records than the 1920 census.
                            Unfortunately, there is a serious problem with the legibility of the 1920 census films
                            produced by the National Archives. Many of the census entries for 
                                Hamilton County
                             are totally or partially unreadable.
               
                     pharmacist, a teacher, a banker, and the president of a utility
                        company.103 The 65 in the low white–collar
                    group included 17 salesmen, 16 clerks, 5 mail carriers, 4 insurance agents, 3 cashiers, and 2
                    bookkeepers. While the white–collar category represented a significant proportion (38.5
                    percent) of the total, it was surpassed by those who fell in the skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled
                    workers categories. These blue–collar workers (together with farmers) constituted a
                    majority (61 percent) of the Klansmen. The skilled category contained 17 molders who worked for the
                    Union Sanitary Company, 18 mill workers, 15 carpenters, and 15 mechanics. The 117 semiskilled workers who represented the largest single occupational category (31.3
                    percent) included 37 employees of the local enameling works, 15 who labored for the Capital
                    Furniture Company, 9 workers at a strawboard factory, and 7 who were rubber workers at the Burdick
                    Tire Company.
            This analysis of the 1923–1926 records indicates the broad occupational diversity found
                    within the 
                        Noblesville
                     Klan membership. While business and professional men played an important leadership
                    role and constituted a significant percentage, they were a minority of the total membership,
                    outnumbered by those in the blue–collar worker categories. It is possible that
                    individuals in many different occupations may have experienced some economic or social pressure to
                    join the Klan. Yet quite clearly the belief that the Klan to a large degree consisted of coerced
                    businessmen is an oversimplification, and the situation in 
                        Noblesville
                     adds support to the revisionist contention that Klan membership represented a broad
                    spectrum of the population. It also must be kept in mind that the 450 men who can be identified as
                    having lived in the town of 
                        Noblesville
                     represent less than half of those whose names appear in the 
                        Hamilton County
                     records.104 The county's Klan "membership had a
                    strong rural component, and it would be fair to assume that many or most of these unidentified
                    individuals were involved in farming.
            
               
                  103 In this analysis all thirty–four merchants and eleven
                        managers were placed in the high white–collar. category; Thernstrom in his analysis
                        places "Merchant with sufficient property" in the high white–collar
                        category, and "Proprietor or manager of a small business" in the low
                        white–collar category. Since there was insufficient evidence to make a distinction
                        based on the size of the businesses these individuals were involved in, this study placed them
                        in the high category. This category perhaps better reflects the status and economic structure
                        found in a small community such as 
                            Noblesville
                        .
               
                  104 These 450 represent 41.5 % of the 1,081 listed members
                        whose residences could be determined.
            
            
            Among those listed in the 
                        Noblesville
                     records were several city or county officials: a city attorney, four city councilmen,
                    the assistant postmaster, the chief of the fire department, a county prosecutor, a superintendent of
                    schools, a coroner, and a county road superintendent. These men constituted a significant
                    percentage, if not a majority, of local officials. Of the fifteen top city officials listed in the
                    1924 city directory, only four appear in the Klan records; of the fifteen in the 1926 directory,
                    seven can be identified from the same records. Of the twenty–four top county posts in the
                    1924 directory, four were filled by identified Klansmen; of the eighteen top posts listed in 1926,
                    four Klan members appear in the records.
            Due to the incomplete nature of the available records it is difficult to ascertain the degree to
                    which Klansmen dominated the political scene in 
                        Hamilton County
                    . The Klan in Indiana was noted for its ties with the Republican party, particularly the
                    administration of Governor Ed Jackson; sometimes it met challenge from Democrats, yet there were
                    also important Democrats like Judge Orbison who were prominent supporters.103 In
                    Republican–dominated 
                        Hamilton County
                    , it appears that the Klan drew support from both parties. Four of the sixteen
                    candidates for county office in 1924 are listed in the Klan records; three of these are Democrats.
                    The only Democrat to win a post that year was Charles Gooding as sheriff.106
                    Seven candidates from each party ran in the 1925 
                        Noblesville
                     municipal election (which the Republicans swept with one exception); five of the
                    Republicans and two of the Democrats appear in the 1923–1926 Klan lists. The names of
                    both candidates elected to office in Cicero that year— one a Democrat and the other a
                    Republican—also appear in the lists.107
            
            An examination of the Ledger and the Morning Times reveals
                    relatively little community opposition, political or otherwise, to the Klan when it was at its peak.
                    The exception was the appearance of a speaker sponsored by the Independent Voters League, which
                    operated statewide in 1924 in an effort to persuade African–American voters to desert the
                    "Republiklan" in favor of the Democratic ticket. The League's efforts
                    failed; Republican incumbent President Calvin Coolidge and Ed Jackson, the Republican candidate for
                    governor, carried every precinct in 
                        Noblesville
                    , including 
                  
                     105 Chalmers, Hooded Americanism, 170–74.

                     the third, where most of the town's African Americans
                        resided.108 Even after the Stephenson conviction and the political
                    explosions that erupted when he released his confidential files revealing the gross corruption of
                    state and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Republican political leaders, there were few public expressions of anti–Klan
                    sentiment in 
                        Hamilton County
                    . The Ledger expended most of its editorial energies denouncing
                    Stephenson as "the monumental liar of the generation," and questioning the value
                    and authenticity of the incriminating material found in his infamous "black box."
                    The paper urged Jackson not to resign as governor, despite the mounting evidence against him, and
                    expressed relief in 1928 when he was spared conviction because of the statute of limitations.109 The Ledger was especially vocal in its support for 
                        Marion County
                     Republican Chairman George V Coffin (also spared because of the limitations statute)
                    and the ultimately convicted 
                        Indianapolis
                     Mayor John Duvall; both had earlier resided in 
                        Hamilton County
                    .110 At the same time the paper minimized the Republican
                    party's connections with the Klan and insisted that, despite the bad publicity generated by
                    the Stephenson scandals, the "Hoosier state has nothing for which to
                        apologize."111
            
            The Ledger did, however, publish one letter in September 1927 from a reader who
                    expressed outrage against the racial bigotry of "so–called 100 per cent loyal
                    and Christian persons." William H. Stern, a Civil War veteran, life–long
                    Republican, and one of the oldest native–born residents of the county, wrote that such
                    racism made his blood boil, and insisted that the "colored race has as much
                    right… to their freedom and enjoyment 
                  
                     108 Ibid, October 24,1924, 6; October 28,1924,1;

                            Morning Times, October 30,1924, 1. The Ledger claimed
                            that the large audience contained few blacks. For more on the Independent Voters League, see
                            William W. Giffin, "The Political Realignment of Black Voters in 
                                Indianapolis
                            , 1924,"Indiana Magazine of History, 79 (June 1983), 133–66. For results of the 1924 election, see Daily Ledger, November 11,1924,6. Coy Robbins, telephone interview with
                            author, May 2001, indicated that his father, who did become a Democrat in the 1920s, was
                            something of a rarity in the black community at that time, and that many blacks did not vote
                            because of their skepticism about politics. Murphy White, a Republican, who in the 1960s
                            became the first African American to be elected to the 
                                Noblesville
                             city council, indicated that today the community's blacks are divided
                            in their political loyalties between the two major parties, although the town still remains
                            strongly Republican.

                            it led to criticism from other Indiana newspapers, including the Republican

                     in this country than the hypocrits [sic] and
                    traitors who oppose them."112 A few months later the Ledger reprinted a letter that appeared in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Star, in which the Reverend N. C. Trueblood deplored the connections that had
                    developed between Protestant churches and the Klan as "un–American,
                    un–Christian and dangerous."113 The following year the paper
                    reported that Father Miles Holland of the Cicero Catholic Church had been recruited as a
                    last–minute substitute by the 
                        Noblesville
                     Kiwanis Club when the intended speaker failed to appear. Father Holland, the first
                    Catholic ever to address the club, spoke on the subject of "good fellowship,"
                    maintaining that hatred and suspicion might be reduced if individuals did business together.114
            
            If the Klan was fading in 
                        Hamilton County
                     as the 1920s came to a close, the nativism and racism of county residents persisted.115 Al Smith, the Roman Catholic presidential nominee of the Democrats in 1928,
                    was trounced in the county returns, receiving fewer votes than any other Democratic candidate. It
                    seems noteworthy that the normally Democratic Morning Times hedged on this race,
                    informing its readers that Smith and his opponent, Herbert Hoover, were both "high type
                    fellows and either will make good Presidents."116 The June before the
                    election, an item in the Ledger announced that a "Liberty Loyal
                    League" was being organized in

                     115 The available Klan records, unfortunately, do not provide precise
                            evidence concerning the degree of membership attrition in the wake of Stephenson's
                            conviction. There is a list of 63 members who were delinquent in dues for the first quarter
                            of 1926. In addition, there is a set of four–part cards, providing the names of
                            263 members who apparently were remiss in paying dues in 1926. Of these 263, the cards
                            indicate that 27 eventually paid dues sometime in 1926, and that another 11 requested a
                            postponement in paying their dues. Subtracting these two groups would leave a total of 225
                            members in arrears who were not seeking a postponement. Four of these 225 filled out cards
                            submitting formal resignations of membership. The names of two of these 225 members also
                            appear on the list of 63 who were delinquent the first quarter of 1926. If one makes
                            allowance for these duplicates, this gives a total of 286 who were behind in paying their
                            dues and had made no provisions for a postponement. This would represent a sizable
                            proportion of the 2,611 
                                Hamilton County
                             Klan members cited in the 1925 Local Officers List. No membership records are
                            currently available for the period after 1926.

                    were soon to be inducted into a local lodge of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics, a
                    national anti–Catholic, anti–black nativist organization formed in the
                    nineteenth century. According to the Ledger the 
                        Noblesville
                     chapter, open to white males between the ages of 16 and 55, had been growing rapidly,
                    with the goals of shielding Americans "from the depressing effects of unrestricted
                    immigration," and maintaining the separation of church and state.118
                    Locally, it was regarded as a successor to the Klan.11? It was not until well
                    after World War II that the de facto segregation of facilities such as restaurants, movie theaters,
                    and the public swimming pool took place, as returning African–American veterans
                    challenged such restrictions.120
            
            Fifteen years after the Stephenson trial, 
                        Noblesville
                     again gained notoriety with the arrival of William Dudley Pelley, who, under
                    congressional pressure, had just dissolved the quasi–fascist Silver Shirts. 
                        Noblesville
                     became the base of his new Fellowship Press, which issued anti–Semitic
                    publications that disparaged America's entry into the Second World War. This led to
                    unflattering comments from 
                        New York
                     columnist and radio broadcaster Walter Winchell, as well as an article in Life magazine that portrayed central Indiana as a hotbed of disloyalty. While 
                        Noblesville
                     had been divided between those who welcomed the new jobs the press might bring and
                    those who were repulsed by Pelley's presence, his prosecution by the federal government for
                    sedition, and his ultimate conviction in August 1942, hardly helped the town's image.121

                        Noblesville
                     has changed dramatically since the 1940s. 
                        Hamilton County
                    , with nearly 200,000 residents in 2000, ranks first in Indiana in its rate of
                    population increase and is among the nation's fastest growing counties.122 It is part of the rapidly expanding metropolitan region of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , with a mixture of farms, small towns, and affluent suburbs (such as Fishers and
                    Carmel) offering expensive homes and condominiums, and upscale dining and shopping facilities. The
                    population of 
                        Noblesville
                     has jumped a remarkable 61% between 1990 and 2000 to reach 28,590. Its
                    carefully preserved downtown, centered on the restored 1878 courthouse, evokes the spirit of the
                    past with brick–paved streets, nineteenth–century street lamps, wrought iron
                    benches, an old–fashioned ice cream parlor, antique and craft shops, and an
                    open–air farmer's market on Saturdays. Yet the downtown is encircled by a
                    multitude of new housing developments and shopping centers; like the county, it presents an almost
                    schizophrenic quality, a curious mixture of past and present, rural and suburban. While some
                    residents have deep family roots in the county, many are newcomers who work in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and have little historic attachment to the region. The superintendent of 
                        Hamilton
                     Southeastern Schools remarked, "The local joke is that an old–timer
                    is somebody who was here before the Kroger's opened last November."123
            
            The Klan has long been held in ill repute in 
                        Noblesville
                    : in 1973, when a group of forty or fifty Klansmen staged a walk downtown in
                    "the shadows of the building where the Ku Klux Klan was destroyed as a political force in
                    Indiana," they were met by local counter–demonstrators carrying
                    anti–Klan placards.124 Yet there is still little racial or ethnic
                    diversity in the region. More than 96 percent of the county's population is white, with
                    less than 2 percent each in the categories of Hispanic or African Americans.123

                    the nation, there is still evidence of racial if not religious friction. In recent years, the
                    appearance of racist graffiti, the absence of minority teachers in its schools, the harassment of a 
                        Noblesville
                     interracial couple, the lack of minorities on county boards, and the alleged racial
                    profiling of black motorists in neighboring Carmel, have led the Ledger, now a
                    warm advocate of multiculturalism, and others in the community to raise questions concerning the
                    area's re–ceptiveness to diversity.127
            
            
               
                        Noblesville
                     residents have chosen a variety of ways to remember (or to forget) the Klan,
                    Stephenson, Pelley, and the views they represented. In 1998, a "Blue Ribbon
                    Committee" excluded mention of Pelley in its publication commemorating the
                    county's one hundred seventy–fifth anniversary.128
                    175 & Counting was also circumspect regarding the Klan's earlier
                    presence, with a brief reference to the Stephenson trial as perhaps "the most memorable
                    event" to have taken place in the county courthouse.129 A publication
                    on the 1992–1994 restoration of the 1878 courthouse makes no mention of the trial at
                        all.130 The county historical society's membership brochure notes
                    that the county's history "reflects the history of the state in general"
                    and that "through national events like the trail [sic] of D. C. Stephenson to today, the
                    county has always been an important part of the formation of the state of Indiana."131

                    in 1940 in one of his numerous appeals of his conviction. During the 1920s, 
                        Campbell
                     recalled, "Torchlight Parades and hooded clansmen riding on horseback were

                    described the electric cross the Klan used in its demonstrations, and related the story of George
                    Kosto's candy store and its name change.133 In another compilation of
                    personal testimonies, John R. Foland's 1976 Remembrances, John Carey, who
                    had been a bank collector in the 1920s, recalled that he could distinguish Klan members by a special
                    insignia, a small circle, which appeared on the cancelled checks he handled. Carey claimed he
                    refused an offer to join, despite advice that membership was a prerequisite for advancement in the
                    banking business. Justin Roberts, who as county prosecutor had assisted at Stephenson's
                    trial, related the difficulty of finding twelve residents to serve on the jury. He, too, had been
                    urged to join the Klan for the sake of his political career, but resisted. In his commentary, Foland
                    remarked, 
                        No one knew how many members of the Ku Klux Klan were in the community or who might be a
                            friend or foe. Certainly the Klan had done their work well. They had donated to the
                            churches, sometimes actually appearing in their robes during a church service, making a
                            donation and leaving. The church was always thankful for the contribution. It was claimed
                            that there were five million members, and no one was certain who they were. … The
                            Ku Klux Klan was a force to be acknowledged, whether one believed in it or feared it.
                                …134
                  
                    
                
            The point that seems to be emphasized above all others by 
                        Noblesville
                     citizens is the town's role in bringing an end not just to
                    Stephenson's career but to the Klan itself. On the fiftieth anniversary of the trial the

                        … having the Klan leader on trial for murder (and eventually found guilty) was a
                            severe blow to the KKK which professed the exercise of puritanical ethics and morality. It
                            was a jury of 
                                Hamilton County
                             citizens who found Stephenson guilty, and thereby damaged the Klan reputation
                            beyond repair.135
                  
                     About the same time Justin Roberts, in his reflections on his role in the Stephenson trial,
                    expressed pride in being "an integral part in bringing about the downfall of the Klan in
                        Indiana."136 His son, Joseph, also an attorney, has given a number
                    of public presentations on the Stephenson affair. In his speeches he stresses the political threat
                    posed by Stephenson, who reportedly had presidential ambitions, and thus the critical importance of
                    his conviction in the county courthouse.137

                    's role in Stephenson's downfall was again highlighted during the
                    furor over the discovery of the Klan records. Tom Jekel, editor of the Ledger,
                    noted that "a

                        A JURY OF 12 HAMILTON COUNTY CITIZENS CONVICTED KU KLUX KLAN LEADER D. C. STEPHENSON IN THIS
                            BUILDING IN NOVEMBER 1925 FOR THE MURDER OF MADGE OBERHOLTZER. THE OUTCOME OF THE TRIAL
                            RESULTED IN THE RAPID DECLINE OF THE THERETOFORE POWERFUL KLAN INFLUENCE IN STATE
                            GOVERNMENT.
                    
                
            If 
                        Noblesville
                     can take some legitimate pride in contributing to the Klan's demise, it still
                    has had to reckon with why so many of its residents became members. Even before the discovery of the
                    Klan records, residents knowledgeable in local history were aware of the support the Invisible
                    Empire had enjoyed throughout the county. Joseph Roberts, in a 1992  address to the local Kiwanis, acknowledged that 
                        Hamilton County
                     had played an important role in Stephenson's rise to power as well in as his
                        fall.140 John Foland's Remembrances, as noted,
                    detailed the organization's local visibility.141 Yet almost as much
                    emphasized as the role 
                        Noblesville
                     played in Stephenson's downfall is the conviction that many who had joined the
                    Klan, particularly among the merchant or business class, did so under coercion, believing the Klan
                    to be a patriotic, charitable organization and largely unaware of the group's bigoted
                    ideology. Once these members learned of the Klan's actual ideology and its inner
                    corruption, they quickly withdrew in large numbers.
            Foland, for example, maintained that "Businessmen joined the organization [the Klan] as an
                    insurance to the fact they could meet their bills. They were forced into joining." He
                    described a business owner who "was approached by a Klan member and told he had better join
                    or his business would be destroyed." Roberts observed that "a lot of people joined
                    the Klan to protect their business. Others really believed in the Klan. They thought the
                    organization stood for good things. They were gullible people and I felt sorry for
                        them."142 In a Kiwanis address a number of years later his son
                    suggested, "The Klan was sold as a patriotic organization. It backed the isolation politics
                    of the day. Although it was an organization of WASPS (white Anglo–Saxon Protestants), it
                    was not known in Indiana as an anti–black or anti–Jewish group."143 County historian Joe Burgess also believed that many men joined the Klan to
                    prevent harassment or boycotts.144 Prior to his discovery of the Klan records,
                    Don Roberts had known of the group's activities, but he, too, had been led to believe that
                    merchants joined under threat of boycott, and that the Klan of the 1920s, with its emphasis on
                    patriotism, was a very different type of organization than today's.145
            
            This understanding is shared by younger members of the community. David Heighway responding to the
                    discovery of the Klan records, maintained in the Ledger that

                        Many of the people on the list were forced to join through boycotts. Others left very quickly
                            when they realized the true goals of the organization. Some openly resigned, others pleaded
                            financial reasons. The organization was virtually defunct by 1926.
                        It is important to remember that the 
                                Hamilton County
                             Klan only officially existed from 1923 to 1926. That is just four years. (The
                            Brady Bunch Fan Club lasted longer than that).146
                  
                     In trying to explain to the 
                        New York
                     Times some of the reasoning behind the county historical society's decision
                    not to disclose the names of Klan members, Heighway alluded to Klan threats of boycotts against
                    merchants, adding, "There's an ethical question here … since we
                    don't know how many people were forced to join the Klan."147
                    Tom Jekel informed his Ledger readers that 
                        History shows that many Klan members of the time were hoodwinked into thinking that the
                            movement was about patriotism, not racism.
                        No newspaper, radio station or TV station that I know of has criticized the 
                                Noblesville
                             people who joined and quickly quit this pro–American group 70 years
                            ago when its white–supremacy motives were exposed.148
                  
                     In the same vein, Gregg 
                        Montgomery
                     in his column argued that 
                        During the 1920s in 
                                Noblesville
                            , virtually everyone was a Klansman.
                        If you didn't belong to the Ku Klux Klan, you essentially weren't part of
                            the community. Businessmen on the Courthouse Square quickly learned that, losing clients if
                            they didn't sign up and pay dues. …

                        Stephenson's notoriety helped reveal the true intentions of the KKK's white
                            supremacy ideas. Many locals were embarrassed and rebuffed their membership in the Klan
                            almost as quickly as news traveled from the 
                                Hamilton County
                             Courthouse, where Stephenson's trial was held.149
                  
                    
                    
                        Montgomery
                     a Purdue graduate who arrived in 
                        Noblesville
                     in the late 1980s, was told by local history buffs that the Klan of the 1920s was a
                    more "pc" (politically correct) organization than it is today. It had begun in the
                    town as primarily a religious and fraternal group, and its members were embarrassed, during the
                    publicity that came in the wake of the Stephenson trial, to learn of its true meanings.130 Diane Nevitt, an almost lifetime county resident who succeeded Heighway as
                    director of the historical society, had heard little before the Klan records' appearance
                    about the group's activities, even though she had known that her uncle had served on the
                    jury that convicted Stephenson. At the time of the discovery, she was informed that the Klan had
                    consisted mainly of merchants, that they had been blackmailed into joining, and that they left upon
                    learning the organization's true nature.151
            
            A survey conducted among twenty–eight county residents attending a presentation on the
                    Klan sponsored by the county historical society in August 2001 yielded similar responses. When
                    queried as to what groups the Indiana Klan of the 1920s opposed, twenty–three respondents
                    identified the organization as anti–African American, seventeen as
                    anti–Catholic, fourteen as anti–Jewish, and twelve as
                    anti–foreigner. Yet only five identified the Klan as a hate group, while fourteen
                    identified it as a "social, fraternal organization" and fourteen identified it as
                    a "group designed to protect the interests of white, Protestant Americans"

                    explanation of why people in 
                        Hamilton County
                     had joined the Klan in the 1920s, only three made reference to factors relating to
                    prejudice or bigotry, and two others made general references to "fear." Fourteen
                    respondents, however, singled out factors relating to social or economic pressures.152

            In other words, 
                        Noblesville
                     residents condemn the Klan as an organization but are more forbearing in assessing the
                    motives of those who affiliated with the group during the twenties. Yet if the Klan's
                    triumph was relatively short–lived, as local observers correctly point out, the
                    documentary record leaves little doubt about the organization's ideology or its baser
                    characteristics. This helps explicate the quandary of those who value their ancestral history and
                    yet share a distaste for the Klan and would like to erase, minimize, or repudiate an especially
                    sordid episode in the town's past.
            
               
                        Noblesville
                     is not unique in having to reconcile itself with its Klan heritage. For many years,
                    residents of 
                  Pulaski, Tennessee
               , the 1865 birthplace of the original Klan, maintained a
                    sanitized image of that organization as "a noble and chivalrous group that saved the South
                    from the ravages of Reconstruction." The second Klan was not well received, however, and in
                    1917 the United Daughters of the Confederacy donated a plaque, affixed to the old courthouse, which
                    was designed to honor the founders and simultaneously disassociate them from the new Klan, which the
                    daughters considered "unworthy of the name made sacred by men who bore it in years gone
                    by.'" There was again consternation when, beginning in 1985, latter–day
                    Klansmen, neo–Nazis, and others initiated annual pilgrimages to 
                        Pulaski
                    , bringing with them unwelcome media coverage. The "solution" was a
                    concerted local campaign to distinguish the original Klan, remarkably recast as a preserver of
                    racial harmony, from the more recent extremists. In 1989 the owner of the old courthouse turned the
                    Klan plaque around so that its inscription faced the wall to demonstrate that the community turned
                    its back on prejudice.133
            
            The historic role of Stone Mountain, 
                        Georgia
                    , parallels that of 
                        Pulaski
                    , for it was here on Thanksgiving eve in 1915 that William J. Simmons and a small band
                    of followers launched the second Klan movement. Like 
                        Pulaski
                    , Stone Mountain became a mecca for latter–day Klansmen. By the 1990s
                    residents of the small tourist town that adjoined the mountain were chagrined by the site's
                    annual Klan gatherings, which included processions through their main street and cross burnings. The
                    Klan rallies ceased in 
                  to a group who came to hear his presentation on his research on the 
                                Noblesville
                             Klan. The author would like to express his appreciation to Diane Nevitt and
                            David Heighway for their assistance in arranging this presentation.

                     1991, and six years later Chuck Burris, an African American,
                    was elected to serve as mayor of this community of 7,000 which included a growing number of
                    newcomers with little awareness of the town's previous connections with the Klan. The new
                    mayor expressed his hope that in the future Stone Mountain would come to be regarded as a symbol of
                    racial healing rather than one of racial hatred.154
            
            In his Mystic Chords of Memory, historian Michael Kammen points out that
                    "societies in fact reconstruct their pasts rather than faithfully record them, and that
                    they do so with the needs of contemporary culture clearly in mind—manipulating the past
                    in order to mqld the present." He observes that, "We arouse and arrange our
                    memories to suit our psychic needs."155 Kammen also notes the tendency
                    of those dealing with their local histories to reconcile the antithetical values of tradition and
                    progress in order to extol a "'tradition of progress.'"156 To varying degrees, Nobles–ville, 
                        Pulaski
                    , and Stone Mountain have all chosen paths of reconstruction in dealing with their
                    uncomfortable pasts.157
            
            Undeniably, the citizens of 
                        Noblesville
                     and 
                        Hamilton County
                     are making serious attempts to understand their past and to make amends for past
                    mistakes through present actions. The Klan years are an intrinsic part of the history of 
                        Noblesville
                     and 
                        Hamilton County
                    , and many people in the community have come to accept that fact. They have, to
                    paraphrase Don Roberts, refused to burn their history. This attitude is reflected in the decisions
                    of the historical society in dealing with the Klan records and in editorials in the Ledger. On the other hand, the process of reconstructing 
                        Noblesville
                    's history as it relates to the Klan and other racist and nativist movements
                    remains problematic. It is understandable that residents today have difficulty in getting the Klan
                    right, given that the group can be perceived as a fraternal organization, as a reform movement that
                    appealed to people's patriotism and idealism, and as a sinister, corrupt enterprise

                     that defrauded and hoodwinked its own members. Yet the commonly
                    accepted local view that the Klan was a brief if embarrassing part of 
                        Noblesville
                    's history, that many members joined under coercion not fully understanding the
                    Klan's hateful agenda, and that it rapidly disintegrated in the wake of the damaging
                    evidence unleashed by the Stephenson conviction, does not tell the whole story.
            James Madison, in his recent examination of the 1930 lynching of two African–American
                    youths in 
                        Marion
                    , Indiana, discusses how over the past decade that community has attempted to make
                    amends through a number of efforts, including bestowing the key to the city to a third individual,
                    James Cameron, whose life was somehow spared by an enraged white mob. 
                        Madison
                    , however, emphasizes that what transpired in 
                        Marion
                     must be understood in the context of prejudices that preceded Indiana's Klan
                    era and persisted many years thereafter.158 In this sense, too, it is difficult
                    to burn history. The disconcerting events that took place in Nobles–ville during the
                    1920s cannot be erased by any process.
            A close examination of the available evidence indicates that the 
                        Noblesville
                     Klan was a manifestation of the racism, nativism, and anti–Catholicism that
                    was a central ingredient of white, Anglo–Saxon, Protestant culture, both before and
                    during the 1920s—even in a locality that might legitimately claim countervailing
                    traditions of tolerance. If the 
                        Noblesville
                     records lend strong support to the revisionist argument that the twenties Klan should
                    be seen as a mainstream movement, not as a group of demented, marginalized misfits, other available
                    sources very much suggest that the Invisible Empire could not have achieved such tremendous support
                    in 
                        Hamilton County
                     had there not been a strong base of bigotry to draw on (a point acknowledged in varying
                    degrees by revisionists and very much emphasized by their critics). Klan leaders explicitly pandered
                    to these prejudiced sentiments, with considerable success.
            "Getting right with the Klan" is no easy task, either for historians or for
                    communities trying to come to terms with their past. By the time of the 1995 discovery of the Klan
                    records, there was general acknowledgment that there was something shameful about the
                    Klan's one–time strong presence in the community. The public discussion of what
                    to do with the newly discovered records, and the ultimate decision to accept and preserve

                                Madison
                            , 41–42, 160, finds no evidence to support the commonly held
                            assumption that the Klan played a direct role in the lynching.
               
                     them, testify to the community's changing
                    sensitivities. Locals also express genuine pride in the plaque in the courthouse, and the building
                    itself has become a symbol of a community attempting to "do the right thing." The
                    objections raised by historians and African–American spokespersons to the policy of
                    restricting access to the records demonstrate, however, that not everyone would agree that 
                        Noblesville
                     was doing the right thing. Those who appreciate a local historical society's
                    need for broad public trust and support will empathize with the dilemma faced by the board of
                    directors; at the same time it is possible to see why some might interpret their decision as one
                    more act of denial. Moreover, the "progressive" local spin on what happened in 
                        Noblesville
                     during the 1920s tends to obscure the essential point that the Klan of the twenties was
                    a painful symptom of racial, ethnic, and religious antagonisms that were deeply rooted in the
                    town's—indeed the nation's—past.
            Historical researchers face a parallel quandary. There are still many unresolved issues that surround
                    the phenomenal success of the Klan of the twenties, including the motives of those who joined and
                    then left the organization.159 It is important that historians and others
                    scholars examine and reexamine these matters. As historian and cultural critic George Lipsitz
                    reminds us, "What we choose to remember about the past, where we begin and end our
                    retrospective accounts, and who we include and exclude from them—these do a lot to
                    determine how we live and what decisions we make in the present."160
            
            
               
                  159 As significant as the Stephenson conviction may have been, there needs
                        to be more research on the local level to understand the unraveling of the Hoosier Klan, which
                        certainly began before the Stephenson trial. See Safianow, "'Konklave in

            The State of Public History in Indiana
            A Conversation with David Vanderstel, Reid Williamson, and Sal Cilella
            
               David Vanderstel: Both of you have been a part of the history scene in Indiana for
                    a number of years in different capacities.1 In your opinion, what is the state
                    of history and historic preservation in Indiana?
            THE STATE OF HISTORY IN INDIANA
            
               Reid Williamson: Historic preservation is certainly far better off than it was some
                    thirty years ago. I judge that by the participation of the citizens of the state—not just
                    the elected officials, not just our cultural leadership, but the grass roots—everyday
                    citizens who have a sense of the importance of history as evidenced by the historic architecture and
                    historic sites in their communities. This kind of participation has grown immensely in a number of
                    ways.
            
               DV: Why do you think that the public is more interested now in historic
                    preservation?

                    not previously, recognized in each community as valuable and worthwhile. There seems to have been a
                    reversal somewhere in the almost thirty years that I've been working here, from an attitude
                    of "that old building, that eyesore, let's get rid of it and move on" to
                    "wait a minute, what does that building, that historic site, tell us about ourselves, about
                    our community?" That interest has coalesced into over 200 local organizations devoted to
                    the preservation of their community's architectural heritage.
            
               Sal Cilella: Reid can see this more dramatically than we can by the physical
                    evidence of buildings and people wanting to save them. We don't usually deal with that kind
                    of evidence, except in my own case. My first professional job was as the director of the Northern
                    Indiana Historical Society. I was there from 1970 to 1973, and our museum occupied an 1854
                    courthouse in 
                        St. Joseph County
                    , which the citizens of the county and the politicians had saved. They went further than
                    that after I left. They saved the Oliver Mansion down the street, physically moved the historical
                    society out of the courthouse down to the mansion, and established a new Northern Indiana Center for
                    History. Most importantly they saved the old courthouse. I went through it when I came back to
                    Indiana two years ago. It is magnificent, and it's being shown in something of the same
                    condition  in which it was established, with clerks'
                    offices, judges' offices, and a refurbished courtroom on the second floor.
            As far as history is concerned, it's more difficult to gauge if we've come a long
                    way or not. I think perhaps, falling back on the model of a building, that this building
                    we're sitting in now—which the citizens of Indiana and the society's
                    board put together for $40 million—is a prime example. A staff member told me
                    once, "Isn't it wonderful that people would spend all that money on
                    history?" So maybe it's the building that is the tangible evidence of our progress
                    in both fields.
            
               DV: How would you rank Indiana with other states in their dedication to history and
                    historic preservation?
            
               SC: It's different in different states. We have somewhat similar
                    backgrounds. You were in Savannah, [
                        Georgia
                    ], and I was in 
                  Columbia, South Carolina
               , for fourteen years. History in the
                    South is different from history in the North. The history of the North, especially east of the 
                        Mississippi
                    , is the story of vast hordes of immigrants coming into this country, wave after wave
                    after wave. Very little of that in the South, so the region had a more homogeneous population. The
                    greater ethnic diversity in the North impacted our history and how it is transmitted from generation
                    to generation.
            
               RW: Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana is the largest local or statewide
                    non–profit historic preservation program in the country, which is somewhat surprising.
                    You'd think it would be in 
                        Virginia
                    , or 
                        Massachusetts
                    , or some other place in the East or the South. SC: When I moved here, people insisted
                    that they "didn't know Indiana had any history." We have 10,500 members.
                    RW: We have nearly 10,300.
            
               SC: But that is another indicator that we are offering a product people are
                    interested in. One of the problems we have here in Indiana is that we are too shy about our
                    successes. We don't like to brag about things. I think we've got a lot to brag
                    about in these two areas.
            FUNDING FOR HISTORY
            
               DV: We indeed have some of the largest, best–funded history
                    organizations, which is due, of course, to Mr. Eli Lilly. But is there also something to what we
                    hear about "Hoosier heritage"? What do you think makes being a part of these
                    organizations so important to people?
            
               RW: I think it's a matter of having individuals recognize who they are,
                    what they are, and where they come from. Their heritage tells them that. Once that occurs, then
                    selling our institutions, if you will, selling our  history,
                    becomes easy. Raising money becomes easy, getting political clout becomes easier, but it all has to
                    emanate from the grass roots. It has to come from the citizenry. That's what influences the
                    politicians, and that's why Sal was able to raise $40 million for his History
                    Center and we were able to raise $2.5 million to build our new headquarters along with
                    additional funds to establish nine field offices around the state.
            
               SC: That is a model to which everybody ought to aspire. Our challenge is to get
                    into the grass roots instead of being isolated in the capital, as we sometimes feel we are. One of
                    the Historical Society's greatest challenges is to be a statewide institution, and often
                    people keep pulling us back to being an 
                        Indianapolis
                     institution. I want to set up the same geographic kind of outreach [as Historic
                    Landmarks], but it's much different in our situation. They can rally around physical
                    buildings; we rally around something more amorphous.
            
               DV: If you had the regional offices, how would you be able to go out and do the
                    same thing? I know that you have the local history services. SC: That's where I'd
                    start, with our local history services. They would have the task of dividing the state, using
                    Landmarks as a model with its nine districts, work with a strong historical society in each region,
                    start working with them as partners, or affiliate with them on some level.
            
               DV: Would you create regional offices?
            
               SC: Yes, if we could afford it, but we aren't in a position to do it yet.
                    RW: Look at the money expended on this wonderful facility we're in, put that together with
                    the eleven locations that we have, including our museums, and you've really got some
                    significant committed money, but more important is the significant representation of historic
                    interests that abound in the state. All of our regional offices have advisory councils that are
                    comprised of cultural and heritage leaders within their area who, in turn, are responsible for
                    leading their local groups. So there is a massive network that is more lateral than vertical. There
                    are some holes still left in the state, but in general we're fairly well covered now. SC:
                    Let me remind you too that we're both non–profit. We are not a part of the
                    government.
            
               DV: And you think that's important?
            
               SC: Absolutely. It provides you a greater amount of creativity and freedom than you
                    can imagine.
            
               DV: In the past few years we have seen around the nation many historical sites shut
                    down, and libraries and archives cut back on staff. How have you weathered the budgetary situation?
            
               RW: We at Historic Landmarks have had to make some minor cuts, no major
                    programmatic cuts, and that's because our contributors and supporters  have stayed with us as we have weathered the downturn of these last
                    three years.
            
               SC: Where we differ greatly is in fundraising. We started in the
                    fund–raising game very, very late, because at one time the society had such a large
                    endowment that it didn't need to raise any money. This building pulled the society out of
                    its shell. The board said, "We want to do public programs, we want to get more involved in
                    the community." And that cultural change led to fundraising. The first year that the
                    society did any serious fundraising was 1994. In that entire year we raised as much money as we
                    raised this past October [2003]. That's how far we've come in nine years.
                    We're catching up, but it's going to take awhile. RW: That's an
                    interesting parallel. When I was first hired we too were living off "Mr.
                    Eli's" largesse. I was informed of this in one of my first board meetings after
                    presenting a new membership program. I think we had 200 or 300 members then. They didn't do
                    fundraising: "We do not solicit!" I wondered if I had made a mistake in coming
                    here. That's what we do in the nonprofit world—we fundraise. So actually our
                    change was very similar. We started earlier because I was hired earlier.
            
               DV: Let's stay on the budget issue. Given the diverse needs of
                    contemporary society, how can you justify support for history, history education, and historic
                    preservation?
            
               SC: That's a good question. As director of the 
                        Columbia
                     Museum of Art in 
                        South Carolina
                    , my main job was to sell art, and now I'm back in the history field, selling
                    history, I've got to say that it's much easier selling history than it is art or
                    anything else. The reason is that everybody's got a history, whether it is personal or
                    extended family. And that is intriguing and understandable, whereas art is not always.
                    Unfortunately, many Americans don't care about art. Those same people, though, have a
                    family memory and a family history. They relate to history. That's the key to Landmarks and
                    the Society. People in this country love old houses and they love to know about their roots.
            
               RW: Everybody has personal landmarks: a grandparent's home, the school
                    where they first matriculated, the church, synagogue, or temple where they first learned about a
                    higher being, etc., so in our business it's a relatively easy sell. Now we don't
                    ask just everybody; we're selective. Our programs for fundraising are targeted to specific
                    individuals for specific projects, but they come from a broad base of citizens who are already in
                    our network as members and give us leads. The whole process then relates back to local history and
                    local landmarks, because every community has them, just as every person does.
            
               SC: It's a cliche, but we're all looking for our roots and our
                    personal history. 
                    
                  An Educational Program for Local Schoolchildren Courtesy Indiana Historical
                            Society
                I don't know about Landmarks, but we have members in all fifty states and we get
                    letters from people in 
                        California
                     saying, "I grew up in 
                        Muncie
                    , Indiana, and I'm so glad to see that the historical society is doing what
                    it's doing."
            
               DV: Have you seen a growing interest in history over the years that you've
                    been involved? Nationally, we've seen rising attendance at museums, history book clubs, a
                    history television channel, documentaries including Ken Burns's films, but in your tenure
                    have you seen a wider public acceptance of history and historic preservation?
            
               RW: Sure—our growth in membership, from 300 to over 10,000, and the
                    explosion of local historic preservation organizations, from a dozen to more than 200, are, I think,
                    the best evidences of that.
            
               SC: Yes, I see it all the time. Again, it goes back to individuals and family and
                    history and roots. I want to know where I came from; I want to preserve where I came from; and I
                    want to preserve as much as I can. It  seems almost instinctual.
                    Now, what they're getting when they come here is another question. If they go through an
                    exhibit, for example, do they take back knowledge? You see a decline in attendance in places like 
                        Williamsburg
                    , which has not achieved a million visitors since the early 1990s. They hope to hit
                    750,000 this year. You ask yourself, "What is going on here?" There are books like
                    a biography of John Adams sitting on top of the best seller list; and now all the founding fathers
                    are hot. Currently there are four biographies of Benjamin Franklin on the market. Maybe people
                    aren't really reading these books but giving them to each other as gifts.
            BALANCING THE PUBLIC AND THE ACADEMIC
            
               DV: Since both of your institutions serve diverse yet similar audiences, how do you
                    position yourself to address the concerns of the academics and professionals on the one side and
                    deal with the general public on the other?
            
               RW: We use architectural historians who are academics to lay the blueprint for us,
                    to show us what's historic in our communities, what are the most important historic
                    structures, the next most important, etc. We actually do have an historic site rating system, and we
                    rely on the academics to give us an objective appraisal of all of our sites, places, and buildings
                    around the state. Our information is credible, and we can hold it up whenever a threat is imminent
                    for a particular historic landmark. These appraisals are often the basis for our arguments against
                    the destruction of a landmark.
            
               SC: This is one of my favorite questions, and it's a fascinating issue.
                    First of all, I think it's a bit of a false dichotomy, the popular versus the scholarly. I
                    think that scholarship, at least at this institution now, is not an end product but a process. We
                    must continue that process in order to produce a popular product. If we don't use the
                    scholarly process to produce that popular result, then we are no different than Disneyland. I tell
                    my staff that research and our library are the differences between us and Disneyland. People are
                    looking for entertainment, for history as entertainment, and the great change in the last 30 years
                    has been this shift from the scholarly to the popular.
            Years ago, institutions like ours were focused on a very narrow scholarly niche of the American
                    populace. We were criticized just recently for not producing more scholarly books. The comment
                    revealed an ignorance of the book publishing market on the part of the speaker. If we published  books for only that narrow niche, we would go out of business
                    in a heartbeat. I think many authors are writing to the popular taste today, but I don't
                    think they've diluted the scholarly basis of it. We just met with the 
                        Minnesota
                     Historical Society Press. They do 28 books a year on topics all over the ballpark but
                    all related to 
                        Minnesota
                     history. We need to do more that's related to Indiana history written in a
                    popular vein.
            
               DV: You have established your own press?
            
               SC: We've been doing publications for years, and we just changed the name.
                    We are now the IHS Press. It gives us stature and an instant degree of public recognition.
            
               DV: This raises the issue of the rise of public history within the past 30 years.
                    Are you finding more individuals—whether it be professionals, academics, or those in
                    historic preservation—willing to make that crossover in their writing and public
                    speaking?
            
               RW: Whether this is on point or not, I don't know. Ten percent of our
                    employees are Phi Beta Kappa graduates. I could not say that ten years ago. If Phi Beta Kappa is an
                    emblem of scholarship, we are attracting many more of the "best and brightest"
                    than we used to. I think that's terribly important.
            
               SC: What we're talking about here is language. Thirty years ago, when a
                    scholar wrote for other scholars, he or she would write in the most academic, turgid way possible.
                    Today you can convey that same information in a very readable format. You've got to make
                    history accessible to everybody, and that's what we're doing. But you still need
                    that scholarly basis.
            And thirty years ago you wouldn't find in a museum a restaurant, a gift shop, an auditorium,
                    classrooms, and public spaces like we have now. That's a huge change in the museum field.
            
               DV: Do you think that part of that is the influence of Disney?
            
               RW: When Disney first came into popularity years and years ago, there were a lot of
                    historic preservation people condemning it and damning it as artificial. I was one of those who did
                    not. I rather welcomed it because I felt it would do what I think it's done, which is to
                    raise awareness of some basic forms of historic American architecture. It's a different
                    scope; it's a different method of presentation; and, yes, it is all artificial. But to be
                    there in person on the artificial cobblestone sidewalk in that artificial setting and see citizens
                    of this country relate those artificial historic buildings to something back home, I think is
                    valuable, and I think that it popularizes and makes what we have around us every day even more
                    understandable and therefore more valuable.
            
            When the Circle Center Mall was built in downtown 
                        Indianapolis
                     a similar process occurred. Indiana citizens recognized the balance and the harmony
                    between the old [historic facades of the buildings that make up the mall] and the new [interior
                    behind the facade]. Listening to what people were saying on the sidewalk, you could hear them
                    pointing out the old buildings and reading the plaques we put on the old storefronts.
            
               DV: I assign an article by Mike Wallace called "Mickey Mouse
                    History" to one of my classes.2 He criticizes Disney for their
                    artificial approach and for presenting a romanticized, simplistic view of the past.
            
               SC: That argument you hear over and over in different contexts. You hear it now
                    about Dan

                    We've seen the same controversy over Oliver Stone and the JFK assassination, and the recent
                    Reagan movie on television. If you're a thinking citizen and you take these things as
                    fiction, then they're not going to mislead you. Some historical fiction is very good.

                        Gettysburg
                     College for the Civil War course there. It's extremely well done and very
                    insightful. We miss the point that some people find these gateways to more learning.3
            
            
               RW: Yes, it raises historic awareness and, not to defend Disney, but
                    they're honest about what they are. What I do think is wrong is to take a phony theme, for
                    example a Swiss theme, and plant it on an existing courthouse square in Indiana and say
                    you're adding to history. You are not; you are being deceptive.
            
               SC: Ten years ago you wouldn't have heard the word
                    "genealogy" spoken in historical societies because that was not
                    "real" history. But now we realize it is a gateway to history for a lot of people
                    who, in the past, had that door slammed by the academic crowd. They missed this wonderful
                    opportunity to bring people into the history fold by saying, "You can learn your family
                    history and relate it to the larger picture. What's going on in the world as your family is

            THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF PUBLIC HISTORY
            
               DV: Let's shift gears and talk about careers. Have career opportunities in
                    your professions changed over the course of your tenures? And if so, how?
            
               RW: Historic preservation is a relatively new offering in academia and the heritage
                    professions in our country. Historical societies, written history, and historical research have been
                    around a lot longer. Yet I think that historic preservation has grown at an accelerated rate
                    compared to the rest of the heritage and history field, including the area of careers. Fifteen years
                    ago we had three graduate programs in historic preservation, and there are now nearly twenty.
                    Fifteen years ago there were maybe  a half–dozen
                    places to get an undergraduate certificate or an associate degree in historic preservation. Now
                    there are over twenty accredited colleges and universities where you can major in historic
                    preservation. That has been a huge boost to providing the generalists whom we hire to do historic
                    preservation work around the country.
            
               SC: In the museum field we have seen an increase in professionalism in the last
                    thirty years. In 1970 there were three programs in the entire 
                        United States
                    . Now you can get a museum studies course or program in virtually every major
                    institution in this country. The number of people going into the field has increased exponentially.
                    The thing that I don't see, which is sad, is diversity. You don't see minorities
                    entering the field, and that has got to change.
            MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND PUBLIC HISTORY
            
               DV: Now there is a National Museum Fellows Program headquartered at the Adanta
                    History Center that tries to get minorities involved.4 Do you have the same
                    problem in historic preservation, the absence of diversity?
            
               RW: Our national organization, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, has
                    had the same problem.5 They have a national reach with offices across the
                    country, and they have a dedicated program to hire minority career track historic preservationists,
                    but they have rarely met their goal. We have tried in Indiana, but I must say not successfully.
            
               SC: Same here. We've publicly committed to minority hiring, but we
                    can't find qualified candidates; and when we do, private industry can offer more lucrative
                    wages.
            
               RW: We have created an African American Landmarks Committee, one of our most
                    effective and active committees, comprised of African–American leaders across the state
                    involved in heritage and history, and we give a scholarship each year through that committee. But in
                    every case, for 10 years since we've been giving this scholarship, the young man or young
                    woman who has received the scholarship has gone on to another career.
            
               DV: Is there anything that we can do to attract minorities into this particular
                    profession?
            
               RW: To me it's a long–term answer. For example, we have had to
                    learn anew about African–American culture. Through our African American

                     Landmarks Committee, we have learned that what is important to
                    their past, their heritage, their experience, is not necessarily what we have learned to record as
                    eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. I remember the first time we asked the
                    committee for their recommendations—most were places, rarely were they buildings.
                    Preservationists are trained to look at buildings and the like. These were places.
                    These were corners where jitney service was implemented by African Americans for African Americans
                    when they were not allowed to ride respectably on public transit. One such place was the corner of
                    College and 19th Street in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , recommended by the committee chairman Stanley 
                        Warren
                    , former Dean of Education at DePauw University. That evening, before I went home, I
                    trekked out to 19th and College and found a street corner. I didn't
                    find any emblematic serious piece of historic architecture. I found a street corner. But to Dr. 
                        Warren
                     as he grew up, that was an important place in his neighborhood. So getting back to
                    questions about career tracks for minorities, I think that when our field becomes more
                    accommodating, loosens judgments on what's historic and what isn't, then young
                    people of minority cultures will see that their viewpoints are also recognized as important.
            
               SC: We have just begun an initiative with the Latino community. We know from
                    demographics that within ten years 52 percent of the kids in 
                        Indianapolis
                     schools will be Latinos. We have started a dialogue with the community, working with
                    the Mexican Counsel, to preserve their history, and they're excited about it.
                    We're not doing this so we can provide more converts to the field of history museums and
                    history, but to preserve their story as they move into the area. It would be great if we get a
                    Latino archivist or curator or director out of this some day. But we're starting from the
                    beginning by focusing on collections.
            
               RW: We have a huge mountain to overcome because historically new developments have
                    wiped out neighborhoods and landmarks of our minority communities. Our highway system did it
                    nationwide and did it here in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The expansion of IUPUI, for instance, has virtually decimated what was once the proud
                    West End, leaving only Ransom Place, just a few small blocks, a small vestige of what was one of the
                    city's important residential neighborhoods. Look at Indiana Avenue, which used to be the
                    commercial and social focus of African–American activity and culture, and now
                    it's virtually gone. Where was historic preservation when we almost lost Lockefield
                    Gardens, one of the best examples of middle–income African–American segregated
                    housing? Until we can get past the bad experiences in which historic preservation has failed
                    minority communities, it's going to take some time.
            
            
               DV: How did you address the African–American landmarks, and did you
                    purposely go out and reach for the Latino community?
            
               SC: Yes, we learned about the group LaPlaza, an umbrella organization of four
                    different Latino groups here in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and invited them to use our boardroom on a monthly basis. They took our offer, and now
                    we're talking to them about the need to preserve their heritage.
            
               RW: Years ago, I found myself trying to defend African–American heritage
                    as exemplified by their historic architecture. Lockefield Gardens was a threshold issue; I was not
                    able or didn't know how to mobilize the African–American leadership and found
                    myself feeling awkward trying to talk about somebody else's heritage and culture. An
                    African American came to me one day to ask, "What are you doing now about
                    African–American landmarks?" I scratched my head. So we formed a committee
                    comprised of African Americans and that's how we got into it—personal experience
                    that was unpleasant and awkward but led to our asking this particular part of our community what was
                    important to them.
            PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF HISTORY ORGANIZATIONS
            
               DV: That's a good segue way to questions about public perceptions. Sal,
                    the Indiana Historical Society began in 1830 as an effort to preserve the history of the young
                    state. It was established by civic and political leaders of the day. It essentially continued as an
                    old pioneer's club and as a men's club for many years. By the 1990s the society
                    had embarked upon extensive efforts of public outreach and programming. What about that change? I
                    know you weren't here at that time. What suddenly brought the society to thinking that they
                    needed to expand from their focus on scholarship to reach out into the community?
            
               SC: Ironically it was the need for more space. Space was getting tighter and
                    tighter over in the old library, and they began thinking in the early '90s about the need
                    for a new headquarters. One of the basic questions asked was, "What are we going to do in
                    this new headquarters?" And the answer was: "Public programs." One
                    question led to another: "If we do public programs we're going to have to raise
                    money to support them." The society didn't have a public program division until
                    1994. I've got to give a lot of credit to one of my predecessors, Hubert Hawkins in the
                    early 1970s. His vision was to be more publicly oriented. He wanted to bring the institution out of
                    its shell, but he did not have the wherewithal to do that until Mr. Lilly passed away in 1977 and
                    left this endowment that we now enjoy. In many respects we are living Hubert Hawkins's  dream of getting the society out from behind its shelves and
                    its bookcases.
            
               DV: So this has been a positive move, you think?
            
               SC: Oh, yes, because the society could go on forever with its endowment, but it
                    would never grow. It would only grow as much as the stock market went up or down, because it would
                    never be subject to any public scrutiny. Now that we accept money from the public, we have to be
                    answerable to them. Transparency is a good thing.
            
               DV: Okay, Reid, Historic Landmarks began in the 1960s as an advocate of identifying
                    and preserving historical properties and defining historical neighborhoods. Today it owns properties
                    around the state. It's involved in museum education programs at numerous sites and a
                    successful tour program. How did it start? Have these tours been a good thing for Historic
                    Landmarks?
            
               RW: Fifteen years ago they were a failure. We closed our little concierge office in
                    the lobby of the Hyatt Hotel. We sold our two tour buses and had to wait because the community
                    wasn't ready. Maybe we weren't ready.
            
               DV: Has this public programming brought in new members? Has it changed the image of
                    Historic Landmarks?
            
               RW: I think the answer is yes. What really helped us the most was building our own
                    building on the canal in 1991. Prior to that we were in a worse location and setup than was the
                    Historical Society. The IHS was then sharing a building with the State Library and had no
                    independent identity. We were worse. Our headquarters was in the gatehouse of Crown
                    Hill Cemetery. Beautiful building—bad location. And talk about bad branding.
            Placing ourselves in this high–development, high–visibility area, we moved the
                    oldest historic building along the canal to its current location where we then had to double the
                    size of it.6 This probably did more for our visibility than anything else we had
                    done to date. What did more for our respect was a lawsuit. In 1985 we entered a lawsuit against the
                        White River Park Development Commission which did not follow the
                    state's heritage and historic preservation laws when they tore down a historic school,
                    School #5 on West 
                        Washington
                     Street. It was a battle of the major local legal firms, Barnes and Thornburg against
                    Baker and Daniels, and it made the front page of the paper every day for about a week. We won and
                    upheld the state law that says if you are a state body or a quasi–state body

                     and you use your agency to demolish or to change a historic
                    building, you've got to go through a review process. They failed to do that. We prevailed.
            
               SC: An interesting historical contrast between these two organizations.
                    We're 100 years older than they are, but we still haven't caught up to where they
                    are because we were a closed society for so many years. This building has truly been
                    transformational. Our challenge in gaining the respect that Reid's talking about is to make
                    this building a vibrant, viable place for people to come together and learn about their history, not
                    just Indiana history but the broader context of U.S. and world history.
            HISTORY ORGANIZATIONS AND THE STATE
            
               RW: Unfortunately, we have had to go to court more times than I would like in order
                    to defend state heritage laws. I'd like to get into both of our relationships with the
                    state. It's one of the ways that Sal and his organization and ours have collaborated
                    recently, and I hope for more. There is now a willingness to go to the mat when right is right and
                    wrong is wrong. That was not true years ago.
            I think we have the highest standards for public heritage and history in the Indiana Historical
                    Society and Historic Landmarks, but the state does not take advantage of either of our institutions
                    as much as they could. The IHS is willing and ready to take over the state archives
                    mess—it's inaccessible, remote, and understaffed. The society has offered to do
                    that on a collaborative management agreement, but the state has not taken advantage of the offer. We
                    are both now collaborating to get a new Department of Indiana Heritage to achieve the first major
                    change in state government in the heritage and history field for thirty years.
            
               SC: We have an opportunity here, with limited resources in the state, to
                    consolidate under one department reporting directly to the governor on all historic functions at the
                    state level. We could collaborate better with one entity. The governor's office, under
                    Governor O'Bannon, spent a lot of time with their personnel department looking to see where
                    functions overlap, where there could be changes. Progress has been made, but I understand this has
                    been going on for five years. I'm a member of a special commission that the governor
                    established to look into greater collaboration, and it needs to be regenerated. There's
                    still a chance for a public/private partnership that would not only save the state money but would
                    serve the citizens of Indiana better.
            
               DV: It seems rather odd since 
                        Indianapolis
                     seems to pride itself on public/private relationships.
            
            
               SC:
                        Indianapolis
                     does, but maybe Indiana doesn't.
            
               RW: Right now there are seven divisions, agencies, and departments scattered
                    through state government, and I firmly believe that by consolidation we're going to get
                    greater efficiency and cost savings, and we're finally after thirty years going to raise
                    the level of importance of heritage and culture in this state.
            
               SC: It says to the rest of the country that we're really serious about our
                    history.
            
               RW: That's not something new. Other states have done this. I think this
                    consolidation would be a cost saver but we're having a hell of a time, frankly, with the
                    bureaucracy. There is a resistance to change. DV: I would say that is something inherent in being
                    Hoosier.
            
               SC: No, it's inherent in being bureaucratic.
            
               RW: This new Indiana Department of Heritage really gets us excited. Then there
                    would be the opportunity for Sal to talk to someone who has direct access to the governor about the
                    state archives; likewise, it would give me an opportunity to improve our program of protection of
                    state property. Now, state property that's historic is not being adequately protected.
            
               SC: We could work better together. We presented a plan to the Historic Commission
                    that we're both sitting on to build a building for the state archives in the IHS parking
                    lot. We cannot legally own the archives because they belong to the state. They are state papers. But
                    we would, under a management contract with the state, manage the property. We could jointly put up
                    the building and do private fundraising with state money. And as Alan January, the acting director
                    of the archives, said to me, "You've got all of the infrastructure in this
                    building already set [so] that we would not have to duplicate it in the new one":
                    auditorium, food service, a gift shop, classrooms, and exhibition space. What we would maintain here
                    are the valuable papers of Indiana, going back before statehood, that are now in a very vulnerable
                    warehouse on the east side of 
                        Indianapolis
                     that barely missed the tornados of September 2002. The image is just frightening, and
                    we've got to convince the powers–that–be at the state level that a
                    new building is imperative.
            
               DV: What both of you are saying is that you're really focusing on the
                    issue of historical advocacy. Preservationists have been very active and historians really have
                    never done that.
            
               SC: What we are saying is that we have an opportunity for the state to get its
                    historical house in order by entering into a public/private partnership.

            THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC HISTORY IN INDIANA
            
               DV: Historians don't predict the future, but what do you see for the
                    future of history and historic preservation in Indiana? We've already talked about your
                    desire to develop this new state department, but what else do you see and what you would like to
                    see?
            
               SC: I would like to see more public access, and that's a thing
                    we're working on very strongly here. In the past, generations of librarians and historians
                    were not willing to share information, and I'm seeing a nice change in that area.
                    Technology is helping us provide more access. We're digitizing many of the images in our
                    collection so you can pick them up on the Internet. I also think that we need to strive for more
                    diversity in the field, other people's history rather than history as we have done it in
                    the past.
            
               RW: We're starting to see political platforms that include historic
                    preservation, call it revitalization or whatever name the political party or candidate wishes to
                    use. We couldn't say that twenty years ago because we were thought to be a
                    frill—something nice, but not necessary. I think we've overcome that to a large
                    degree, and now I would like to see us  be able to affect the
                    political process. I'd like to see political leaders use the words "historic
                    preservation" in a bold and aggressive way, so as not to hide historic preservation behind
                    community revitalization, and do so in local, state, and national election campaigns.
            
               SC: One of the words we've not used in this whole discussion is
                    "elitism." Both of our organizations—nationally, regionally, and
                    locally—have been tagged by that word. But both groups have moved away from it because
                    we've embraced other populations. We've gone from the elite to the popular, and
                    that's important.
            
               DV: And do you see that coming from both external and internal sources?
            
               SC: Yes. Museums had to change in the '80s as they became more democratic
                    and experienced a large infusion of state, local, and federal money. The result was to open their
                    doors to all. I know a lot of museums resisted that, but it was a good thing for the more staid,
                    musty institutions. Now we're in the next generation.
            
               DV: Thank you both.

                    Opera
            WALLACE M. CHEATHAM
            Operas are usually premiered in metropolises famous for their theaters; sometimes in a city with a
                    major university or a music conservatory; but almost never in a high school auditorium in a small
                    city possessing none of these cultural amenities. Yet on June 10, 1949, the opera Ouanga, with music by classical violinist and composer Clarence Cameron White and libretto
                    by scholar and writer John Frederick Madieus, was given its first fully staged performance at
                    Central High School auditorium in 
                        South Bend
                    , Indiana.1
            
            The event takes on a greater historical significance because the music and words were written by
                    African Americans, and because the local group who performed the premiere, the Harry Thacker
                    Burleigh Music Association, was made up almost entirely of black Hoosiers. Understanding the history
                    of this association helps to explain why such a musical event occurred in such an unlikely place.
            
               Wallace M. Cheatham's research deals with various aspects of opera as it relates to
                        the African–American experience. His book Dialogues on Opera and the
                            African American Experience, conversations with nine African–American
                        artists, was published in 1997. Dr. Cheatham was also a consultant for Dorothy Evans MGinty,
                        ed., A Documentary History of the National Association of Negro Musicians (
                            Chicago
                        , 2004).

            In 1933 Josephine Curtis and her husband Dr. Guy Curtis moved to 
                        South Bend
                     from 
                  St. Louis, Missouri
               . Mrs. Curtis was eager to continue the active life
                    in both music and drama that she had known in 
                        St. Louis
                    , but she found in 
                        South Bend
                     very few opportunities for blacks who had an interest in music and other art forms.2
            
            Taking matters into her own hands, very shortly after arriving Mrs. Curtis founded the Harry Thacker
                    Burleigh Music Association.3 Her vision for the group was
                    wide–ranging: she sought a vehicle for African Americans to bond through music and
                    theater, and to give blacks who had studied music a performance venue. She also wanted to let the
                    larger community know that the spiritual was not the only form of black music. Curtis wanted to
                    demonstrate that music was universal, that it had no ethnic boundaries, and that all music could be
                    sung and enjoyed by anyone who wanted to delve into its riches.4
            
            Lorene Richardson, a former member, recalls the association this way: "The Burleigh (as we
                    called it) was the only [black] community group in the city (or the state), the sole purpose of
                    which was to perform music. [In addition to people from 
                        South Bend
                    ], we had members from 
                        Elkhart
                    , Gary, and Niles, 
                        Michigan
                    ." She also noted that the group instilled a professional demeanor in its
                    members. "Those who participated in [the Burleigh] learned the basic protocol of performing
                    artists; punctuality, dependability, sense of ensemble, stage movement, and decorum."5
            
            A significant number of pieces in the group's repertoire came from the genre of operetta.
                    This was distinctive because most black vocal performance groups in America during this period
                    focused on opera, oratorio, mainstream choral literature, and African–American folk
                    music. Records document a 1933 performance of Friedrich Flotow's opera Martha; a 1934 performance of Michael W. Balfe's opera The Bohemian
                        Girl; a 1935 performance of Edward Jakobowski's operetta Two Vagabonds, and a 1937 performance of Samuel Coleridge–Taylor's
                    operetta Hiawatha.6

                        spirituals and for his association with Czech composer Antonin Dvorak.

            Reviews of these productions have not been located, suggesting that there was little or no press
                    coverage for the first years of the association. The group had to prove itself a viable artistic
                    entity. Had the association not reached a level of maturity and quality that commanded attention
                    from the press, far fewer records would be available to researchers.
            The local newspaper began to send a reporter and to run reviews of association performances in 1947,
                    with the production of Bedrich Smetana's opera, The Bartered Bride.
                    George Maurer wrote in his review titled "Bartered Bride Charms Crowd" that
                    "[t]he cast was competent, well chosen, and the chorus was unusually well
                    balanced." Bohemian Girl, performed in 1934, was mounted again in 1948.
                    "Burleigh Group Does Well by Balfe's Gay Work" is the headline of Frank
                    G. Schmidt's review "The choral work in this production is highly commendable
                    … sprightly and cheerful. …
            The opera is given a simple production and costumes are bright."7

            Each fall the association presented a concert featuring art songs, arias and choruses from operas and
                    oratorios, standard choral literature, and various genres of folk music. An opera or operetta was
                    presented every spring.8 An examination of cast lists reveals that the group
                    maintained a nuclear core of singers for major operatic roles throughout its history. Both the 1947
                    and 1948 operas, for example, listed twelve soloists; of these twelve, eight singers starred in both
                    productions. There was also a stable group of choristers and supernumeraries. This created a
                    repertory–company atmosphere with high standards for every production. These factors were
                    key in the association's growth and stability and helped to maintain community, media, and
                    philanthropic support.
            At the center of the Burleigh's success was a triumvirate: founder Curtis, 
                        Georgia
                     Ward Bryant, and James Lewis Casaday. It was their collective effort that made the
                    association a cornerstone of the performing arts community.
            Curtis came to her position as founder of the association with a performing arts background, academic
                    training, and a history of social activism. She grew up as a part of the black middle class, was a
                    1927 graduate of the University of 
                        Chicago
                    , and studied music at the small, private, and almost solely Caucasian Kroeger School of
                    Music in 
                        St. Louis
                    .9 The early years of the twentieth century were a very socially
                    restricted time for blacks in the Midwest in general, and Curtis's willingness to brave a
                    white university and a white music conservatory indicates the same spirit of activism that prompted
                    her to found the Burleigh and to work, throughout her life, for the arts, better housing, and racial
                        harmony10
            
            
               
                        Georgia
                     Ward Bryant was Josephine Curtis's right arm at the association. As rehearsal
                    pianist and accompanist, she was at the forefront of all the group's activities. Bryant
                    acquired her training privately within the. religious community of 
                        South Bend
                    , through the teaching of Catholic nuns. Her son John Charles remembered his mother as
                    being an insistent advocate for what she believed to be "good music." Association
                    alumni recalled Mrs. Bryant as being highly skilled, uncompromising, and a real advocate for the
                        Burleigh.11

            John Lewis Casaday was the association's stage director. A graduate of Williams College and
                    the University of 
                        Iowa
                    , Casaday had come to 
                        South Bend
                     in 1938 to serve as director of dramatic arts for the city's school system.
                    Association papers indicate that he became part of the Burleigh's staff shortly after his
                        arrival.12
            
            Casaday was the only white staff member at the Burleigh. In addition to suggesting the
                    director's own liberal–mindedness, his many years of work with the black music
                    group would seem to indicate its high level of quality. Casaday, like Curtis and Bryant, insisted
                    that members learn and maintain professional standards of work and conduct. As Lorene Richardson
                    recalled, "Much of what was learned about the discipline of being performing artists
                    happened through the work of Mr. Casaday."13
            
            If the Burleigh Music Association had never staged a premiere of an important American opera,
                    musicologists would still record that the organization was significant and worthy of research. The
                    premiere of Ouanga, however, elevated the Burleigh to a new level of distinction.
            The 1949 premiere was, for both composer Clarence Cameron White and librettist John Frederick
                    Matheus, the culmination of a journey that began in 1924 when White became head of the music
                    department at West 
                        Virginia
                     State College. White (1880–1960) was a graduate of Howard University and the
                    Oberlin Conservatory. He was already an experienced teacher, an accomplished violinist, and a
                    published composer. Matheus (1887–1983), a graduate of Western Reserve University and 
                        Columbia
                     University and a professor of romance languages, came to the college in 1922. The young
                    academic was interested in Haitian culture and was also a published and prize–winning
                    short–story author. As the two men developed a close professional relationship, White
                    came to share Matheus's interest in 
                        Haiti
                    , and the possibility of an artistic collaboration was born.14

            White and Matheus's fascination with 
                        Haiti
                     was part of a larger movement among European and American blacks at the time.
                    Negritude, which grew out of, among other sources, the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, was for many
                    African Americans an historic step in the formulation of a diasporic identity. The movement
                    emphasized and valued the African ancestry of black Americans and fostered pride in their current
                    heritage and culture. The movement looked to the cultural forms of the French Caribbean as sources
                    for recovering African beliefs and practices, and thus in the 1930s and 1940s many black artists,
                    musicians, and writers began to  study 
                        Haiti
                     and other islands. White and Matheus's work has an often–neglected
                    place in the history of the movement.15
            
            Grants from the Rosenwald and Harmon foundations, along with a monetary award from the college that
                    White received for musical achievement, financed a 1928 summer of study in 
                        Haiti
                     for both men.16 Their plan was to gather materials for an opera
                    based on the island's history and folklore. Once there, Matheus plunged even more deeply
                    into studying 
                        Haiti
                    's culture. White searched the island for folk music to use as a basis for the
                    opera's score. He was already deeply familiar with spirituals and had published violin and
                    piano compositions based on that musical form. While he found nothing like the spiritual in 
                        Haiti
                    , White did discover what he described as a "strange, weird sort of rhythm
                    running through the Voodoo rituals." "It was," he later recalled,
                    "a new and different rhythm and I studied it until I had mastered it. … That
                    rhythm is the basic rhythm in 'Ouanga' and it is authentic."17
            
            After the study period in 
                        Haiti
                    , Matheus returned to West 
                        Virginia
                     and the college. He completed the opera's libretto in 1929. White, with an
                    extension of one of his fellowships and a study leave, went to 
                        Paris
                     for two years to study operatic composition with Raoul Lapara and to finish work on the
                    score of Ouanga. His training almost certainly included becoming absorbed in the
                    French school of opera by attending performances at the 
                        Paris
                     opera. This influence, in fact, can be seen clearly in Ouanga. French
                    opera nearly always contained fully staged dance scenes, very often ballet. White included dances in
                    his opera, using types that were indigenous to Haitian culture.18

            As White moved further into the score of the opera, his compositional plan that had been established
                    with Matheus—to create an opera based on Haitian history and musical
                    forms—became more far–ranging. White wanted to "produce an opera
                    entirely for and about Negroes," believing that such a work had heretofore not been
                    composed. "There is a native dramatic ability in the Negro and deep wells of music within
                    him," White said, and he expressed the belief that these qualities inherent in black music
                    would make Ouanga a success.19 White did not intend to produce an opera that
                    could be performed and enjoyed only by black artists and audiences. He wanted, rather, to use the
                    cultures of the African diaspora in the same way that white European composers had utilized their
                    own cultural identities in creating the existing French, German, Italian, and Russian schools of
                    opera.
            
               Ouanga was completed in 
                        Paris
                     early in 1932.20 Under the sponsorship of the American Opera
                    Society of 
                        Chicago
                    , scenes from the opera were performed, in concert version, on November 13, 1932, at 
                        Chicago
                    's Three Arts Club. On this occasion, White won the organization's
                    coveted Bispham Medal. Established in 1921, the medal (named after baritone David Bispham) was
                    awarded to an opera in English by an American composer. Previous medalists included Charles
                    Wakefield, Victor Herbert, Deems Taylor, and Walter Damrosch.21
            
            On June 18,1941, Ouanga was presented again in concert version by 
                        New York
                     City's New School of Social Research, and the performance was broadcast over a
                    local radio station.22 Then came the first fully staged productions on June 10
                    and 11, 1949, at Central High School auditorium in 
                        South Bend
                    , in performances by the Burleigh Music Association. Just

                how the opera came to this particular city and this group is still a matter for
                    speculation. Association alumni, interviewed many years afterwards, could not recall any prior
                    acquaintance between Josephine Curtis and Clarence White. It may be, however, that the two musicians
                    already knew each other through one or more professional associations. The composer was instrumental
                    in the founding of the National Association of Negro Musicians and served as its president from 1922
                    to 1924. During that  same period Curtis was active in the
                    musical life of 
                        St. Louis
                    , one of the cities which had a branch of the NANM. Curtis's student days in 
                        Chicago
                     may also have provided a contact. The 
                        Chicago
                     University of Music, founded by Pauline James Lee, often featured leading black
                    musicians as guest faculty, and White spent many summers teaching there.23
            
            Even without personal associations between the composer and the group's founder, in the
                    context of 1940s American race relations White's choice was understandable. There were no
                    major opera companies to which a black composer could submit a new work and expect both serious
                    review and a real chance at being included as part of the repertory. The sole exception at the time
                    of Ouanga's premiere was William Grant Still's Troubled Island, produced by the 
                        New York
                     City Opera in 1949, but only after years of laborious negotiations.24
            
            
               Ouanga was set in 
                        Haiti
                    , in 1804, during the reign of the emperor Dessalines. Key to the plot are his attempts
                    to change the culture of his people into one similar to the French court of Napoleon. Christianity
                    and the traditional religion of voodoo come into conflict, and the two philosophies vie for
                    dominance on the island, eventually bringing the death of the emperor's beloved, Defilee,
                    and his own downfall.23
            
            White had chosen the soloists for the major roles. The starring roles of the emperor and Defilee were
                    played by native Haitian singers Fritz Vincent and Carmen Malibranche, but many of the other
                    principal roles were sung by members of the Burleigh.26 Curtis had prepared the
                    chorus (members of the association) over a five–month period; Casaday had designed the
                    costumes and sets and staged the production; and three choreographers had created the dance numbers.
                    The principal conductor of the performances was Zigmont George Gaska, a well–known
                    conductor from the region; White conducted the overture and one of the opera's two
                        entr'actes.27

                  27 Gaska was the conductor and founder of five performing ensembles in
                        northern Indiana: the
            
            
            Joseph Charles, the Haitian ambassador to the 
                        United States
                     and the island's delegate to the United Nations, attended the second
                    evening's performance. Charles was also one of the patrons who made the 
                        South Bend
                     premiere possible. Ticket and program sales would never have covered the necessary
                    costs—general section tickets were only one dollar each and programs were fifty cents.
                    The Burleigh, however, assembled a group of supporters, including the Haitian ambassador, the
                    University of Notre Dame, the Welber Foundation, the Indiana Cab Company, and a local car
                        dealership.28

                    Tribune reviewer Frank Schmidt wrote of the richness and intricacy of the opera.
                    He felt that the work was an orchestral gem but was unkind to singers. The critic also pronounced,
                    however, that both the orchestra and the singers had met the demands of the score. He concluded by
                    declaring the performance a resounding success.29
            
            Alumni of the Burleigh, interviewed in 1995, were still excited when they reminisced about
                    "their premiere." They talked about the vocally challenging writing in
                    White's score and the level of concentration required to perform in a fully staged,
                    full–scale production of a grand opera. Lorene Richardson added that this "was
                    the first time that we performed an opera with full orchestra." Alumni also recalled the
                    stimulation of performing in the presence of the opera's composer and librettist.30
            
            Principal conductor Gaska, also interviewed the same year, was still enthusiastic about the special
                    place that the 
                        South Bend
                     arts community, the Burleigh, and Josephine Curtis had carved out in the annals of
                    music history: 
                        
                     Ouanga is an involved score with complex orchestration and intricate
                            writing for the voice. Ouanga was challenging, but very personally
                            rewarding to conduct. Challenging, because beyond the formidable task of learning the opera,
                            there was the emotional task

                        New York

            The Burleigh Music Association produced its last opera, Taylor's Hiawatha,
                    in 1959; the group's last performance was probably a concert given in the fall of 1960. As
                    one member later recalled, "Once the leading participants especially Mrs. Curtis, Mrs.
                    Bryant, and Mr. Casaday, were no longer active, no new person stepped forward to carry on and the
                    association ceased to exist."34 Matheus continued as a teacher and an
                    author of stories, poems, and plays, and died in 1983. White conducted, arranged, and composed
                    music; his Elegy for orchestra was a prize–winner in 1954 and was premiered by the 
                        New Orleans
                     Philharmonic. He died in 1960. For one brief period the work of White, Matheus, Curtis,
                    Casaday, and all the members of the Burleigh placed 
                        South Bend
                    , Indiana, on the international opera scene. Perhaps more importantly for the
                    long–term life of the city, the Burleigh Music Association provided many years of
                    high–quality performance opportunities for black Hoosiers who would otherwise have been
                    excluded by the barriers of racism and it offered just as many years of musical enjoyment to the

            A Musician's Musician
            STANLEY WARREN
            Great music often draws on diverse sources and great musicians typically defy categorization. The men
                    and women who redefine the form and content of the musical genre in which they work often live
                    "before their time" and are recognized only at the end of a long career or after
                    death.
            Scores of well–known Indiana musicians have made significant contributions to the world of
                    music. Fans of jazz will recognize the names of Wilbur and Sidney DeParis, horn players from
                    Crawfordsvflle; Speed Webb, band leader from Peru; and Sid Catlett, drummer from 
                        Evansville
                    . 
                        Indianapolis
                     was home to saxophone player Beryl Steiner, trombonist J.J. Johnson, pianist and
                    vocalist Russell Smith, orchestra leader Reginald DuValle, singer and vaudevillian Noble Sissle,
                    pianist Carl Perkins, bassist Leroy Vinnegar, brothers Wes, Monk, and Buddy 
                        Montgomery
                    , and the members of the Ink Spots.1
            
            Far less known to jazz lovers is the name of Belford C. "Sinky" Hendricks,
                    composer, arranger, pianist, and conductor from 
                        Evansville
                    , Indiana. Yet it would be difficult to find an adult who lived during the 1950s or the
                    1960s who has not hummed a tune written or arranged by Hendricks.

                  Belford Hendricks and an Early Band Courtesy Jeffrey Bibbs, Sr.
                Why then, is he still relatively unknown? One reason is that Hendricks often worked behind
                    the scenes as arranger or conductor. But just as important, much of the music that he wrote and
                    arranged defies easy categorization. As a promotional piece released for the Mercury Records album
                        Belford Hendricks and Orchestra said of him: "He's at ease
                    in many musical settings." With a background in jazz and the blues, he could perform and
                    write swing music for the big–band sound of the Count Basie Orchestra, but he could also
                    create a lush, pop sound for singers such as Dinah 
                        Washington
                     and Nat King Cole.
            As a music lover, I was surprised that I had never heard of Hendricks until a casual conversation I
                    had with his nephew, Jeffrey Bibbs, Sr. This soon led to longer, more serious talks with Bibbs and
                    his mother, Belford's sister Dorothy Hendricks Bibbs. As a result of those conversations, I
                    began to organize the materials and stories that Jeffrey and his mother provided to me.2 Below I offer a brief biographical sketch of Hendricks, an account of some of
                    his most important collaborations, some resources for

            BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH
            Hendricks was born in 
                        Evansville
                    , Indiana, in 1909 to parents Frank and Melissa. In 1924, at age 15, he graduated from
                    the town's segregated Douglass High School and enrolled at the Indiana State
                    Teacher's College in 
                        Terre Haute
                    . In 1920s Indiana, state schools were the only higher education open to most black
                    students. As a non–scholarship student from a family of modest means, Hendricks was
                    unable to live the life of a traditional four–year student. He worked nights and weekends
                    and had to sit out some semesters for lack of funds. Whenever possible, Hendricks made money playing
                    piano with local groups in 
                        Evansville
                     and 
                        Terre Haute
                    . He also found it necessary, however, to supplement that income by teaming with his
                    friend Walter Bean to work for his meals at the Elks Lodge and Mother Eaton's Restaurant in 
                        Evansville
                    , as well as the 
                        Terre Haute
                     House in his college town.3
            
            In the early 1930s Hendricks began to spread his musical wings. He played with the Paul Stewart band
                    in 
                        Terre Haute
                    . In his hometown, he played for white audiences at the New Yorker club and at the
                    McCurdy Hotel, where he also worked as a bus boy. Hendricks also played in black 
                        Evansville
                     clubs such as the Shangri–La and the Casablanca. In 1935, he finally
                    graduated from college with majors in science and music. Fellow students remembered Belford for a
                    song—"Zoom, Zoom"—which was always on the tip of his
                        tongue.4
            
            After college, Hendricks left Indiana to enroll in an adult education program at 
                        New York
                     University. He also studied the organ at 
                        Columbia
                     University, took private lessons from A. Jack Thomas in harmony, arranging, and
                    composition, and further studied composition under Rudolph Schramm. During these years he married
                    Mayetta Bean, a sister of his

                    decade, then separated.5
            
            Belford's service in the Army during World War II brought him opportunities to meet and
                    perform with artists who visited military camps to entertain the troops. His contacts with the
                    musicians he accompanied— among them, singer and actress Lena Home—proved to
                    be of great value in his later career.6
            
            After the war Hendricks and his wife resettled in 
                        Evansville
                    . The city hosted an active music scene during the late 1940s, and Hendricks was a major
                    contributor. His piano playing graced the stages of several clubs and hotel lounges, but he could
                    switch to another instrument when necessary. Walter Bean later recalled that "He
                    … could play just about any instrument." Hendricks also developed a reputation
                    by playing on local radio shows, including "The Breakfast Club" and
                    "Toast and Coffee."7
            
            For all of this exposure, however, Hendricks was forced to supplement his income by working as a mail
                    carrier. Engagements were too inconsistent, and pay from musical work was never enough to support
                    himself and his family. Belford and Mayetta divorced in the late 1940s. Seeking new opportunities,
                    Belford moved to 
                        New York
                     City in 1950 to pursue his musical career.8
            
            Hendricks discovered that he was already known to many musicians in the city by word of mouth,
                    despite his relatively anonymous midwestern career. Through early connections, Hendricks was able to
                    secure a spot on the Arthur Godfrey talent show, a launching board for many entertainment careers.
                    But luck deserted Hendricks when he reached the studio. He was told that his chosen and
                    well–rehearsed selection was too similar to that of another contestant and that he would
                    have to perform another piece of music. Under pressure, Hendricks played well but did not win the
                        competition.9
            
            Such ill luck did not last long, however. Shortly after his arrival in

                the city, Hendricks began to associate with many noted musicians whom he had previously
                    only dreamed of meeting. Remembering those years, he later said, "I knew I was that good,
                    but not that lucky."10 One of the most important of these early
                    associations, and one which (according to his nephew) taught Hendricks much of what he learned about
                    the music business, was with the Count Basie Orchestra. Hendricks was a close friend of a regular
                    member of the group and sat in for him during vacations and illnesses. Thus Hendricks was able to
                    play with the orchestra on several occasions, and his working relationship with Basie led to a
                    writing collaboration between the two men, the result of which was the 1954 album King
                        of Swing.11

            As Hendricks's career continued, he was increasingly called on for his breadth of expertise
                    as a composer, arranger, and conductor. He became such a prolific composer and arranger that he
                    often used pen–names to avoid competition among his own tunes. The name he used most
                    often was Bill Henry, but he also used variations such as Belford Cabell Hendricks, Sinky Hendricks,
                    and Belford Clifford Hendricks.
            Perhaps the most significant of Hendricks's collaborations was with a rising young singer
                    named Dinah 
                        Washington
                    , whom he met shortly after arriving in 
                        New York
                    . In 1958, after recording with several musical groups, 
                        Washington
                     chose Hendricks and his orchestra to accompany her on a new album, All of
                        Me. The collaboration was so successful that 
                        Washington
                     and Hendricks worked together extensively in 1959, and by 1960 he became her
                    full–time arranger and composer. Two songs in particular that Hendricks arranged for 
                        Washington
                    —"It's Just a Matter of Time" and "What a
                    Difference a Day Makes"—became signature tunes for the vocalist. Backed by
                    Hendricks's arranging and conducting, 
                        Washington
                    —already known as the "Queen of the Blues" and often
                    compared to the legendary Billie Holiday—crossed over onto the popular music charts, a
                    move that increased her fame and her earning power.12
            
            
               
                        Washington
                    's success with Hendricks's arrangements points to a key feature of
                    his style: he was what today would be called a crossover artist, not only because his talents were
                    wide–ranging and his musical styles capable of such variation, but because his work
                    lacked a specific racial identification at a time when music was still often marketed to racially
                    distinct audiences. Another artist who benefited greatly from this aspect of Hendricks's
                    style was vocalist Brook 
                        Benton
                    . 
                        Benton
                    , with his soothing and easily recognizable voice and a suave manner that captivated
                    audiences, was particularly successful at capturing the emotion in Hendricks's music and
                    used it–for example, with the Hendricks–Otis–
                        Benton
                     song "It's Just a Matter of Time"—to cross from
                    the rhythm and blues to the popular music charts. Sung by black and white performers, purchased on
                    albums, performed in clubs, the music Hendricks wrote and arranged crossed the barriers of a
                    segregated society.
            Hendricks continued to write music throughout his career, but by the late 1950s his reputation as an
                    arranger began to compete with his status as a composer. Hendricks also tried his hand at producing
                    an album,

                which entailed making all of the musical arrangements, producing the recording, and
                    promoting the completed album. Sometimes he also conducted the orchestra or played the piano part.
                    One of his most successful productions was the 1959 Sarah Vaughn album Broken Hearted
                        Melodies.
            
            Among Hendricks's other successful collaborations was his work with Nat King Cole. The two
                    men met in the mid–1950s; in 1958 Cole garnered a hit recording with "Looking
                    Back," a song composed by Hendricks, Clyde Otis, and Brook 
                        Benton
                    . The Hendricks orchestra accompanied Cole on several occasions, and Hendricks arranged
                    such popular records as "Dear Lonely Hearts," "Ramblin'
                    Rose," and "When You're Smiling."
            Hendricks's personal life also improved with his move to 
                        New York
                    . In the early 1950s, he married Emma Clayton, of 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana. They remained together until Belford's death in 1977. Belford
                    Hendricks enjoyed a long and productive career. His name has been largely forgotten, but his music
                    still lives in the voices of artists who sang and played his songs.
            
            COMPOSITIONS AND COLLABORATIONS
            In addition to the songs and artists mentioned above, Hendricks wrote or arranged many other songs
                    and worked with other well–known jazz and pop musicians.
            Among the songs Hendricks wrote or co–wrote are: "Looking Back" and
                    "Nothing in the World Could Make Me Love You Like I Do" (recorded by Nat King
                    Cole); "Call Me" (Johnny Mathis; Frank Sinatra); "Devoted" and
                    "This Bitter Earth" (Dinah 
                        Washington
                    ); "Can't You Just See Me" (Aretha 
                        Franklin
                    ); "It's Just a Matter of Time" (Brook 
                        Benton
                    ); "First Star I See Tonight" (Patti Page); "I'm Too
                    Far Gone to Turn Around" (Bobby Blue Band); "Because of Everything" (Timi
                    Yuro); "Merry–Go–Round" (Al Martino); and "The
                    Mixed Up Cup" (Clyde McPhatter).
            Hendricks's most frequent collaborator was Clyde Otis, director of music at Mercury Records.
                    Other frequent coworkers were band leaders Jimmie Lunceford and Sy Oliver, and vocalists
                            
                  Benton, Washington
               , and Ivory Joe Hunter. Hendricks arranged songs for many
                    famous singers. Among his hits as an arranger are: "Our Waltz" (Sarah Vaughn);
                    "A Mother's Love" and "Runnin' Out of Fools"
                    (Aretha 
                        Franklin
                    ); and "I Want to Thank You Pretty Baby," "Kiddio,"
                    "Fools Rush In," and "Boll Weevil" (Brook 
                        Benton
                    ). However, Hendricks's crossover skills, which worked to the benefit of these
                    and many other artists, often led to his own later lack of recognition. A 1995 remixed CD of eight 
                        Benton
                     tunes, for example, includes five of Hendricks's arrangements. The liner
                    notes, however, give not a single credit to Hendricks for his arrangements; they also list 
                        Benton
                     as the sole author of the popular song, "It's Just a Matter of
                    Time," when the piece was actually cowritten by 
                        Benton
                    , Hendricks, and Otis.13
            
            The musical charts of the 1950s and 1960s, however, offer ample evidence of Hendricks's wide
                    influence on the music of his time. His collaborations with Dinah 
                        Washington
                     were particularly successful in this regard. The song "Baby (You've
                    Got What It Takes)," featuring a vocal duet with 
                        Benton
                    , earned over $1 million and reached number one on the Rhythm and Blues chart
                    and number five on the pop chart in 1960. During the same year "A Rockin' Good Way
                    (To Mess Around and Fall In Love)" also reached number one on the R & B chart and
                    number seven on the pop chart. "What a Difference a Day Makes," arranged by
                    Hendricks 
                  
                     12 Hits, Brook

                        Washington
                    , was number four on the R & B chart in 1959 and number eight on the pop chart
                    during the same year.14 "It's Just a Matter of Time,"
                    co–written by Hendricks and Otis, became a standard, reaching number three on the 1959
                    pop chart. Years later the same song hit number one on the country music charts twice, with
                    renditions by Sonny James in 1970 and Randy Travis in 1984.15
            
            Hendricks was so highly regarded by many in the jazz and pop music world that he was even called upon
                    to remake one artist's singing style. Music critic John Chintala relates the story of how
                    Al Martino, a successful recording artist from the 1950s onward, wanted to change his voice to sing
                    in a quieter and more restrained way. On the recommendation of Nat Cole, Martino worked with Belford
                    Hendricks. From their collaboration, and with a musical arrangement by Hendricks, Martino recorded
                    "I Love You Because," which rose to number three on the Billboard popular music
                    chart in 1963.16
            
            Musicians today continue to hold Hendricks's work in high regard. I interviewed Alonzo
                    "Pookie" Johnson, well–known saxophonist with Jimmy Coe, Wes 
                        Montgomery
                    , and the Ink Spots. After he reviewed Hendricks's record of accomplishment, he
                    was impressed by both the breadth and depth of his work. He contended that, having written and
                    arranged music for so many top–level performers, Hendricks must be considered one of the
                    best in his field.17
            
            After an interview with Jimmy Coe, composer, arranger, saxophonist, and band leader, I was even more
                    convinced that Hendricks was indeed a significant contributor to the worlds of jazz, rhythm and
                    blues, and popular music.18 Coe, who played with the Jay McShann and Tiny
                    Bradshaw orchestras and had his own big band for many years, also played in groups behind Aretha 
                        Franklin
                    , Al Hibbler, Roy 
                        Hamilton
                    , Gladys Knight and the Pips, and other well–known musicians. After reviewing
                    Hendricks's full discography, he commented succinctly, "I have to take my hat off
                    to

                    Coe explained the difficulty of creating a body of work as substantial and of as high a quality as
                    that which Hendricks left behind. He added that one also had to consider the chances of having so
                    much music performed by so many great talents: "We must remember, there are many good songs
                    that never see the light of day."19
            
            SOURCE MATERIAL AND SELECT DISCOGRAPHY
            Hendricks composed over 100 songs during his lifetime and arranged scores of tunes for orchestras,
                    small groups, and individual performers. More than half of the songs were co–written;
                    some appeared under his pseudonym, Bill Henry.
            Very little has been written about Hendricks. Most standard music encyclopedias, whether about
                    popular music, blues, or jazz, yield little or no information on his life and career. Much, however,
                    has been written about many of the musicians with whom he was affiliated. Searching the biographies
                    and autobiographies of these individuals will yield useful results.20

            Hendricks's songs have survived because his music was not faddish; it did not cater to the
                    moment. When Johnny Mathis or Frank Sinatra sings, "Call me, don't be afraid to
                    just call me,"; when Dinah 
                        Washington
                     sings, "What a difference a day makes, twenty–four little
                    hours"—we feel that they are headed for a place we all know. Our hearts and
                    minds are engaged by the music. Perhaps one day Belford Hendricks will receive the recognition he
                    deserves for music which has become an intrinsic part of so many people's lives.

               Sister of the Solid Rock Edna Mae Barnes Martin and the East Side Christian
                    Center By Wilma Rugh Taylor (
                        Indianapolis
                    : Indiana Historical Society Press, 2002. Pp. xxiv, 198. Illustrations, appendices,
                    notes, index. $24.95.)
            The image of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., linking arms with fellow marchers often dominates popular
                    memory of the civil rights movement. It cannot, however, represent the rich variety of means African
                    Americans pursued to achieve social justice during the mid–twentieth century. Sister of the Solid Rock reminds readers that the struggle for equity can start
                    with one individual reaching out to nurture the promise of others.
            Edna Mae Barnes was born into a southern migrant, poor, working–class family mat settled
                    in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the early 1900s. After high school, she met and married Earl Martin, and they
                    enjoyed family life in the growing African–American middle class. Edna Mae was inspired
                    by worsening conditions in her Martindale neighborhood to help the community's children.
                    She started a Christian daycare program with two children and an apartment rented with her household
                    money. Throughout the 1940s the program struggled, unable to draw needed funding from the
                    economically challenged community it served. Martin's independence had alienated many
                    leaders in local African–American churches, and so when a few local white Baptist
                    churches offered assistance, Martin joined with them and formed the East Side Christian Center
                    (ESCC).
            During the 1960s, the ESCC continued to grow and to gain more affluent white donors—in
                    particular the Lilly Endowment. Martin, in her sixties, began to raise funds for a new facility and
                    took on greater administrative responsibilities. By 1965, the facility, built in the heart of the
                    Martindale community, catered to the needs of a broad variety of citizens, from parolees to teen
                    mothers. Martin had neither the time nor, more  importantly, the
                    inclination to march for civil rights. Wilma Rugh Taylor argues laboriously that Martin sympathized
                    with many of Dr. King's goals but believed that serving and loving people would do more to
                    eradicate the world's ills than civil disobedience and marching. The center's
                    reliance on conservative white Baptists and businessmen for funding also meant that Martin could not
                    have endorsed die civil rights movement, even had she wanted to, without considerable risk to the
                    ESCC's finances. Illness finally forced Martin to leave her beloved center, and she died in
                    1974.
            Unfortunately, the author never offers a deeper analysis of the complex racial, gender, and class
                    issues that created tensions between Martin and the board of the ESCC. Taylor does recount some of
                    the discrimination Martin faced when fundraising in small towns and rural areas
                    across Indiana in the 1940s and 1950s, and she conveys a sense of the tightrope Martin walked trying
                    to balance the needs of the center's clients, the demands of its white benefactors, and her
                    own faith–based vision.
            Overall, this biography succeeds in making Martin's achievements and actions as noteworthy
                    as those of more familiar civil rights leaders. While the book lacks breadth in its choice of
                    sources and would have benefited from an understanding of African–American
                    women's grassroots activism, it shines a light on a life worth
                    remembering and an institution still serving Indianians in need.

                         The Life and Music of Paul Dresser By Clayton W. Henderson (
                        Indianapolis
                    : Indiana Historical Society Press, 2003. Pp. xxix, 481. Illustrations, appendices,
                    notes, bibliography, index. $29.95.)
            In this first biography of singer, songwriter, and comedic actor Paul Dresser, Clayton W. Henderson
                    provides an engaging and enlightening account of his subject's life and times, with an
                    emphasis on the culture of 1890s popular song. Dresser is a challenging subject for a biography
                    because, unlike his more famous younger brother, the writer Theodore Dreiser, he left few personal
                    records behind. There seem to be no diaries or autobiographical accounts, and only a few letters.
                    Any chronicle of his life depends upon contemporary sketches in newspapers and magazines and a few reminiscences of friends, most appearing long after Dresser's
                    death. The most detailed accounts of Dresser's personality appear in his brother's
                    works, chiefly the sketch "My Brother Paul" (Twelve Men, 1919) along with a few
                    essays about die 1890s song business. All are refracted through the haze of the younger
                    brother's hero–worship for Paul and his simultaneous  disdain for sentimental music. As a result of this dearth of primary
                    materials, Henderson devotes much of his account to sketching the context of American popular song,
                    providing a fascinating and illuminating history of patent medicine showmen, black–face
                    minstrel troupes, vaudeville entertainers, and the business of music publishing.
            Born in 
                        Terre Haute
                    , Indiana, in 1858 to German immigrant parents, Paul Dreiser, Jr. was the oldest of ten
                    surviving children. In a childhood marked by poverty and privation, he learned to play the piano,
                    picking out tunes by ear, but never learned to read music. His father, a devout Catholic, wanted
                    Paul to study for the priesthood, but after only a few months at St. Meinrad Seminary in southern
                    Indiana, Paul decided against becoming a priest. He left home at age fifteen to play piano with a
                    traveling medicine show; throughout his teens he worked with patent medicine sellers and in minstrel
                    shows. By age twenty he had published his first song and anglicized his name to Dresser. In 1895 he
                    published "Just Tell Them You Saw Me," the song that was to make him famous,
                    followed in 1897 by the wildly successful "On the Banks of the 
                        Wabash
                    , Far Away," now the state song of Indiana. At the height of his celebrity,
                    Dresser achieved wealth and enjoyed friendships with leading 
                        Broadway
                     stars. He was the silent partner of a music publishing firm, Howley Haviland &
                    Co., and its magazine, Ev'ry Month, which his brother Theodore edited.
                    But when his sentimental ballads of home and mother fell out of favor with the advent of ragtime,
                    Dresser fell into a rapid and pathetic decline, dying at age forty–seven in 1906 of
                    complications caused by obesity, alcoholism, and depression.
            Henderson's decision to relegate his discussion of Dresser's songs to a section
                    following the biography is problematic. He did so to allow "the reader who cares little
                    about the workings of music to spend most of his or her time in the
                    life–and–times portion of the book and to dip into the song section only when
                    interested" (p. xviii). While the author acknowledges that the disadvantage of such
                    segregation is to separate discussion of the songs from their biographical context, the result is
                    that the reason for Dresser's importance becomes obscured. There is little discussion of
                    Dresser's developing craft or why his songs captured the public interest; indeed, Henderson
                    quotes comparatively few lyrics. Even the discussion of "On the Banks of the 
                        Wabash
                    " depends on a paraphrase of the song lyrics. Henderson appears to assume
                    discussion of Dresser's music would put off readers, but most readers of a biography of a
                    songwriter will be interested in the connection of the music to the man.
            Perhaps because of the dearth of detail in the record, the strength of the biography is its rich
                    portrayal of the culture of popular song and its biographical sketches of medicine and minstrel
                    showmen, thoroughly documented by Henderson's scouring of historical records. For these
                    reasons, On the Banks oj the 
                            Wabash
                        
                is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable book.

               Dictionary of Midwestern Literature Volume One: The Authors Philip A. Greasley,
                    general editor (
                        Bloomington
                    , Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001. Pp. x, 666. Illustrations, suggestions for
                    further reading, appendix, index. $59.95.)
            This volume presents, in alphabetical order, approximately four hundred entries on individual
                    authors. Each entry begins with name, birth and death dates, and major pseudonyms, and continues
                    with sections on biography, literary significance, identification of major works, and suggestions
                    for further secondary reading. The entries are signed and include the institutional affiliations of
                    some one hundred contributors, all members of the Society for the Study of Midwest–em
                    Literature, the projects sponsor. This volume is the first of a proposed three for the Dictionary of Midwestern Literature. Volume two, in encyclopedia–entry format,
                    will cover important historical and research sites, movements, themes, and genres; volume three will
                    be a discursive, chapter–organized, literary history of the Midwest.
            The author entries are prefaced by general editor Philip A. Greasleys introduction, outlining the
                    definitions and organization of the content, and by an overview essay, "The Origins and
                    Development of the Literature of the Midwest," by David D. Anderson, a founder of the
                    society and a prolific contributor to its enterprises. Both essays attempt to define the
                    geographical and intellectual boundaries of the project, to fix the term "Midwest"
                    and so to clarify the principles of inclusion and exclusion. Neither piece, however, successfully
                    identifies the difference between "Midwestern authors" (that is, persons with
                    their origins and/ or most lasting affiliations with the area) and "Midwestern
                    literature." This ambiguity has implications for the usefulness of the volume. Who is
                    represented here, and on what basis?
            Andersons essay, for instance, concludes with the intriguing note that four of the eight American
                    winners of the Nobel Prize in literature are midwest–erners: Sinclair Lewis, Ernest
                    Hemingway, Saul Bellow, and Toni Morrison. By geographical and cultural affiliation and by attitude
                    these four belong in this volume. The situation is less clear for other figures who also appear:
                    Black Elk, born in Wyoming, raised in the northern plains, and oblivious to the white man's
                    cultural construct of "region"; Joyce Carol Oates, whose connections to the region
                    are a masters degree in English at the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                     and five years of teaching in 
                        Detroit
                    ; James 
                        Norman
                     Hall, co–author with Charles Nordhoff of The Mutiny on the
                        Bounty (1932), born in 
                        Iowa
                     but educated in 
                        Boston
                    , a British soldier, and an English citizen; and Upton Sinclair, whose only connection
                    is that his muckraking expose The Jungle (1906) involves 
                        Chicago
                    . "Midwest," that is to say, is as uncertain a term for the
                    dictionary's editors and authors as it is for the rest of us.
            The individual entries are generally competent and nicely proportioned. The discussions of maj or
                    works by an author  and the notes on further reading are
                    especially helpful in directing the reader to the author's writings and from there to an
                    acquaintance with the secondary scholarship. The chosen authors comprise an effective selection,
                    from historically significant figures like Booth Tar–kington, Carl Sandburg, Kurt
                    Vonnegut, and Aldo Leopold, to promising newcomers like poet Jonis Agee and novelist Nettie Jones,
                    and to more broadly popular and influential people like William McGuffey (of the Readers), children's author Robert McCloskey, and Gary Edward (Garrison) Keillor.
                    Readers might dispute some of the choices, but the volume as a whole suggests the vitality of the
                    midwestern contribution to literature.

               Karl Bodmer's Studio Art By W. Raymond Wood, Joseph C. Porter, and

            The publication of Karl Bodmer's Studio Art coincides with the 200th
                    anniversary celebration of Lewis and Clark's expedition. Although thirty years lapsed
                    before Prince Maximilian of Wied–Neuwied and his hired Swiss artist, Karl Bodmer, arrived
                    in America to document flora, fauna, and Indian cultures, data from Lewis and Clark's
                    journey still provided guidance and inspiration. At the Peak Museum in 
                        Philadelphia
                    , the prince viewed natural and ethnographic objects gathered during the 1803
                    expedition. He later met with William Clark in 
                        St. Louis
                     and received a gift of Clark's "Special Map of the Missouri
                        River in the years 1804,1805 and 1806."
            The book is divided into three sections. "The Eyes of Strangers: 'Fact'
                    and Art on the Ethnographic Frontier, 1832–34," by Joseph C. Porter, describes
                    Maximilian and Bodmer's voyage up the Missouri River from 
                        St. Louis
                     to Fort McKen–zie, 
                        Montana
                    , and assesses the scientific significance of their work, placing it within the context
                    of the ethnographic philosophies of the time. Porter also details the pair's unexpected
                    delay in 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana, the winter before 1833 and the effect the long stopover had on both men.
                    Maximilian's interactions with resident naturalists Charles–Alexandre Lesueur
                    and Thomas Say turned 
                        New Harmony
                     into the prince's "finishing school" for North American
                    exploration, while Bodmer spent his time drawing wa–tercolors and sketches of the
                    settlement and its vicinity.
            "A Publication History of Karl Bodmer's North American Atlas," by David C.
                    Hunt, traces where and when the lithographs were published and also includes research into the
                    artist's complex printing processes and methods of sales, and  his post–expedition life. Hunt's essay also
                    provides comparisons with other mid–century artists who were illustrating the zoology,
                    botany, and ethnology of North America. Readers interested in the history of Indiana will note the
                    inclusion of James Otto Lewis (1799–1858), who painted edinographic studies in the state.
            The third section contains mirty–two black–and–white and twelve
                    color reproductions of Bodmer's work (primarily from the Newberry Library collection in 
                        Chicago
                    ) with knowledgeable annotations by W Raymond Wood. Wood also wrote the introductory
                    essay, speculating on Bodmer's methods for transforming field sketches into completed
                    prints, outlining the background of the Newberry's collection, and evaluating the
                    artist's work.
            Compared with other artists who documented Native Americans in the mid–to–late
                    1800s, Bodmer's artistic quality stands alone. His depictions of human gesture and body
                    language demonstrate precision, talent, and sensitivity. Although hired as an illustrator, Bodmer
                    was trained in the finest European traditions, and the influence of Romanti cism is evident. The
                    print used for the cover of the book, for example, shows a Blackfeet warrior mounted on a refined
                    Arabian horse rather than a more realistic Indian pony.
            The book is well organized and nicely designed, with easy–to–use illustration
                    references. Karl Bodmer's Studio Art is a fascinating, meticulously
                    researched and documented examination of the most important period in Bodmer's life, both
                    artistically and historically The plates are carefully reproduced, albeit small, and give the reader
                    a clear idea of the artist's ability and aesthetic vision. Because the plates are almost
                    all figurative ethnographic studies, however, the book may appeal more to historians than to art
                    enthusiasts. As Wood laments at the end of his introduction, Bodmer continues to be venerated more
                    by historians and anthropologists than by art curators.

               Halfway to Everywhere A Portrait of America's First–Tier
                    Suburbs By William H. Hudnut, III (
                        Washington, D.C.
                    : Urban Land Institute, 2003. Pp. xviii, 478. Maps, notes, appendices, index.

            Professors, planners, and journalists have written many volumes on urban renewal, but few authors
                    have tackled the subject of suburban renewal. In Halfway to Everywhere William H.
                    Hudnut, former mayor of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , attempts to remedy this neglect and to examine what is being done to revive
                    America's first–tier suburbs. Hudnut defines first–tier suburbs as
                    those cities and towns closest to  the central cities that
                    developed before or immediately after World War II. These older suburbs are halfway between the
                    traditional hub of the central–city downtown and the booming edge–city
                    commercial centers along the metropolitan fringe. Though halfway to everywhere that matters in the
                    economic and cultural life of the metropolis, they are too often, according to Hudnut, ignored
                    territory, overlooked by those reporting on the gentrifying core and the expanding edge. Moreover,
                    they are too frequently forgotten by state and federal policymakers.
            With an evangelical zeal appropriate to a former clergyman, Hudnut has traveled throughout the nation
                    visiting a wide range of communities and discussing their problems with local officials and
                    activists. He brings good news from his travels: residents of first–tier suburbs are
                    fighting back and rebuilding their communities. He examines "city stalwarts" in
                    nine communities, leaders who are engaged in the good fight and making a difference. Then in a
                    series of chapters he discusses regional cooperation among suburbs in 
                        Minnesota
                     and northeastern 
                        Ohio
                    ; how 
                  Aurora, Colorado, Freeport, New York
               , and Oak Park, 
                        Illinois
                    , have embraced edinic diversity; die role of the arts in 
                  Alexandria, Virginia
               , Englewood, 
                        Colorado
                    , and 
                        Cleveland
                     Heights, 
                        Ohio
                    ; faith–based initiatives in Camden, 
                        New Jersey
                    ; and infill housing in Arvada, 
                        Colorado
                    . He also considers the relation of suburban development to mass transit initiatives,
                    the redevelopment of abandoned industrial property, the recycling of obsolete shopping malls, and
                    the efforts to revive suburban main street shopping areas. Hudnut does not neglect Indiana,
                    discussing economic development in 
                        Hammond
                     and Carmel and praising the redevelopment of Fort Benjamin Harrison in Lawrence.
                    Altogether Hudnut offers insight and inspiration for anyone concerned about the fate of older
                    suburbs. He reveals what can be done and encourages suburbanites to do it.
            Readers should be warned of some problems with Hudnut's survey. He seems to assume that all
                    suburban communities developed before 1960 face major challenges and constitute a distinctive and
                    troubled class of metropolitan settlement. Yet, in fact, he examines a broad variety of communities
                    ranging from Bronxville—a 
                        New York
                     suburb where the price of homes averaged $1 million in 2000—to
                    East 
                  St. Louis, Illinois
               , ground zero of America's urban catastrophe. Given
                    this great disparity, the concept of first–tier suburbs seems to have limited analytical
                    value and to obscure more than it reveals.
            Moreover, Hudnut ignores the degree to which some inner suburbs have never needed revitalization and
                    to which others have perpetually needed a boost. Some of the communities discussed have always been
                    gritty and others always glittering. Actually what is remarkable about many first–tier
                    suburbs is their stability. Unlike the fashionable avenues of Indi–anapolis's
                    near northside that went from riches to rags between 1900 and 1960 or 
                        Cleveland
                    's Euclid Avenue that fell from social prominence in a few decades, such
                    suburbs as Bronxville, Bexley, 
                        Ohio
                    , Clayton, 
                        Missouri
                    , and 
                        Beverly Hills
                     were upscale when first developed and have 
                    retained their social standing and property values throughout their histories. The most depressed
                    first–tier suburbs are places like Camden and East 
                        St. Louis
                     that were from their beginnings working–class communities. Whereas many
                    central–city neighborhoods plummeted socially and economically during the twentieth
                    century, first–tier suburbs more often slipped or maintained their status. In 1950 urban
                    sages dismissed the inexpensive houses in suburban Long Islands Levittown as the slums of the
                    future. Fifty years later the homes had greatly appreciated in value and were solidly middle class.
                    One might well ask, then, why more of suburbia doesn't need sweeping renewal.

            This book is not the comprehensive survey that its title and appearance suggest. Instead, it is a
                    narrowly focused and often convincing argument for the predominant role of British precedent in
                    giving form to the domestic architecture of the cities, suburbs, and well–settled
                    riversides of the lands fronting the Atlantic Ocean. Its few and brief comments about many of
                    architectural history's meat–and–potato topics for the
                    period— churches, Gothic Revival style, familiar architects, development of landscape
                    design, recent discoveries and interpretations of canonic buildings, forms of urban expansion and
                    new town foundations, etc.—serve only to illustrate the author's principal
                    argument. Indiana (with only 45,000 of its 1850 population of just under a million living in urban
                    areas and barely 4,000 people in its two largest cities of

            The author addresses "intellectual themes" through a wide array of literary
                    sources, principally ones addressing members of a growing middle class who sought to elevate
                    themselves to what they took to be the polite standing of their English counterparts. They abandoned
                    the Federal style founded on the practice of John Soane and embraced new fashions and ideas
                    identified as a "his–toricizing Picturesque." Epitomized by John
                    Nash's practices and made accessible by an abundance of easily transportable books,
                    particularly those of John Claudius Loudon, this "romanticism applied" held
                    Americans in its thrall even as it waned in Britain.
            Americans now fashioned their buildings and contiguous landscapes into picture–like
                    settings evoking various historical associations and providing settings suitable to their
                    proprietors' aspirations. A building had to possess an identifiable style: Egyptian, Greek,
                         Tudor, Rustic, "Doric cabin," Gothic,
                    Oriental, Anglo–Italian, Swiss, or something else. If style were missing, Americans would
                    appear to lack the sophistication required to give their new nation standing in the world.
            In pursuing this argument, the author pointedly attacks the received wisdom that the period was
                    dominated by the Greek Revival and that this style was the authentic American style embodying the
                    nations democratic aspirations. The desire to exhibit a universally acceptable taste is what
                    influenced builders, not the pursuit of an authentic "American architecture."
            But American architecture was distinctive. It made much more, for example, of the porch than did its
                    foreign sources. The author devotes a long chapter to the difficulties of interpreting that
                    difference. Further, Americans converted imported styles based on lithic construction into wooden
                    buildings, although this characteristic waned rapidly at the end of the period, when stone and iron
                    became easily available. And the newer American buildings were generally
                    well–constructed, although illustrations from photo archives reveal that in general
                    nineteenth–century America was very scruffy. Ramshackle buildings in unkempt urban
                    settings crowded in upon the few large, high–status, solidly constructed, and
                    well–designed treasures in the canon of American architecture (usually, and valuably,
                    seen here in various states of incompletion or demolition). These pictures suggest what this world
                    really looked like, and they contrast sharply with the ideal images from pattern books and
                    elsewhere.

            Fourteen scholars have contributed to this interesting overview of the experiences of
                    African–American troops in the Civil War era. The essays cover a wide variety of topics,
                    ranging from accounts of individual battles to the lives of the officers and enlisted men who
                    constituted the 
                        United States
                     Colored Troops (USCT).
            Editor John David Smith begins the book with a long essay which describes in broad terms the
                    creation, organization, and experiences of black Americans in the USCT. Four other essays review
                    battles, from small skirmishes to large clashes. For example, in his account of the battle of Port
                    Hudson, Lawrence Hewitt recounts the creation of the 
                        Louisiana
                     Native Guards, their absorption into the Union army, and their performance  in the battle. Two of the essays focus on the killing of black
                    prisoners by Confederate troops. In another essay, Michael Meier describes how Adjutant General
                    Lorenzo Thomas recruited and organized many of the regiments. Noah Trudeau provides a history of the
                    long–neglected seven black cavalry regiments. The last four essays address other aspects
                    of the central topic. In his examination of Thomas Higginson, James 
                        Montgomery
                    , and Robert Shaw as regimental commanders on the coast of 
                        South Carolina
                    , Keith Wilson explains how their backgrounds and views of the war shaped the way they
                    employed their black soldiers. Edwin Redkey describes how Henry M. Turners experiences as one of the
                    few black regimental chaplains began his distinguished career as a religious leader. Robert Zalimas
                    focuses on 
                        Charleston
                    , where clashes between white and black occupation forces presaged the problems that
                    blacks civilians would face in Reconstruction. The final essay, by Richard Reid, explores the impact
                    of war experiences on 
                        North Carolina
                    's black soldiers. Adding to the overall impact, the work contains a number of
                    excellent battle maps, photographs, and line drawings.
            Unlike many volumes that focus almost completely on battles or on race relations, this collection of
                    essays presents the many different facets of African Americans' Civil War experiences. This
                    is both its strength and its weakness. Readers expecting to get a complete treatment of the black
                    military experience in the war will not find it here. On the other hand, readers will find that this
                    volume is a good introduction to the variety of experiences of African–American members
                    of the Union army and to the impact that the Emancipation Proclamation had on the war, on blacks,
                    and on whites. All of the essays are based on extensive research in a wide range of primary and
                    secondary sources. Many of the authors have crafted well–written and interesting essays,
                    going beyond the information provided in traditional military records to try to provide some insight
                    into the lives of the soldiers. Reid's essay is particularly intriguing for his attempt to
                    trace the soldiers through the post–war era to assess the impact of the war experience.
                    On the odier hand, Meier's piece on Thomas displays the weaknesses of some of these essays.
                    Because of its limited lengdi, the author is able only to partially explore the process of raising
                    and organizing USCT regiments. Its very brevity leaves the reader seeking more information on a very
                    complex process. Overall, however, the essays provide a good introduction to die complex issues
                    surrounding African Americans' military contribution to die goal of attaining freedom
                    during die Civil War.

            In these two ample essay collections Paul A. Cimbala and Randall M. Miller bring together a
                    substantive new array of sources on the Civil War, supplementing a growing series on the North
                    published by Fordham. If the collections are a bit uneven, each essay is well researched and
                    thoughtful, drawing on multiple traditions of historical research, from political to social to
                    cultural, as well as on varying sources of evidence ranging from advertisements to letters,
                    newspapers, diaries, and memoirs.
            While the title of An Uncommon Time stresses the idea of the Civil War as a decided
                    break from the past, the essays themselves suggest both continuity and change. In her fine piece,
                    "A Monstrous Doctrine? Northern Women on Dependency during the Civil War," Rachel
                    Seidman argues that women not only used the well–established ideal of women's
                    economic and emotional dependency on men for the greater good of their families (to argue that their
                    men be released from service, for example), but that they also resisted it in new and old ways,
                    through petitions, strikes and unions.
            Essays range from an analysis of the media and popular culture of the Northern home front to the
                    politics of religion, partisan wrangling, the effects of the war on national institutions (the
                    Smithsonian) and policies, the Confiscation acts, and the federal system of war claims. One
                    particularly fascinating piece concerns the tycoon Jay Cooke and the ways he reconfigured patriotism
                    through his national War Bond drives. "Cooke's accomplishment," Melinda
                    Lawson argues, "was the creation of an alternative definition of loyalty: an accessible and
                    profitable version of national patriotism, rooted in a liberal understanding of citizenship as the
                    pursuit of self–interest, even in times of war" (p. 105).
            
               Union Soldiers and the Northern Home Front concerns primarily the members of the
                    armed forces and their interaction with those at home, following the recent work of scholars such as
                    James McPherson and Reid 
                        Mitchell
                    . Somewhat narrow articles on mobilization in local communities open up to a more
                    expansive section on the war itself. The book closes with essays that move into the postwar era.
            
            Some of this collections most unusual articles illuminate both the unexpected adaptations that the
                    war forced upon the Northern populace and the ways Northerners ultimately resisted die consequences
                    of change. In a lively essay, "Listen Ladies One and All': Union Soldiers Yearn
                    for the Society of Their Fair Cousins of the North," Patricia Richard explores
                    advertisements placed in local newspapers by lonely soldiers looking for some way to meet
                    respectable women with whom to correspond, flirt, and, potentially, marry. The war, she argues,
                    disrupted romantic trajectories, and slowed or barred peoples ability to start families. Here was a
                    way in which people worked to overcome obstacles to their futures.
            In a very different but just as successful article, David Cecere analyzes the racial ideologies that
                    white Northerners carried with them to war, and the ways these were challenged by new relationships
                    and experiences. "The force of daily encounters with—or at least observations
                    of—blacks eroded and modified Yankees' two–dimensional racial
                    notions," Cecere finds, "thereby blending the image of a comical,
                    simple–minded, even subhuman African American with more complex racial models, the nature
                    of which varied from one New Englander to another" (p. 323).
            Certain articles challenge long–standing assumptions about the war in provocative ways. In
                    "We Are All in This War': The 148th 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and Home Front Dissension in Centre County during die Civil War," Carol
                    Reardon illuminates the ways that community values —in this case conservative and
                    Democratic—persisted throughout die war, undercutting any shared sense of national
                    purpose. Michael Bennett also analyzes a constituency that resisted the norm in "Saving
                    Jack: Religion, Benevolent Organizations, and Union Sailors during the Civil War." Rather
                    than the religious dedication attributed to soldiers of the Civil War era, Bennett finds both active
                    and passive resistance to piety, even among sailors faced with death daily— from the
                    elements as well as the Confederates.
            In short, gems are found throughout these collections. As material on the North has grown the
                    historical landscape has changed, with die result diat we now have a more nuanced and insightful
                    history of the war than the polemics of the past gave us. Cimbala and Miller are to be commended for
                    adding to that work.
