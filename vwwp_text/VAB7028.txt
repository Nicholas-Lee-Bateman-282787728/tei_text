                                    SHE stood against the Orient sun,
                                    Her face inscrutable for light;
                                    A myriad larks in unison
                                    Sang o’er her, soaring out of sight.
                                
                                
                                    A myriad flowers around her feet
                                    Burst flame?like from the yielding sod,
                                    Till all the wandering airs were sweet
                                    With incense mounting up to God.
                                
                                
                                    A mighty rainbow shook, inclined
                                    Towards her, from the Occident,
                                    Girdling the cloud?wrack which enshrined
                                    Half the light?bearing firmament.
                                
                                
                                
                                    Lit showers flashed golden o’er the hills,
                                    And trees flung silver to the breeze,
                                    And, scattering diamonds, fleet?foot rills
                                    Fled laughingly across the leas.
                                
                                
                                    Yea, Love, the skylarks laud but thee,
                                    And writ in flowers thine awful name;
                                    Spring is thy shade, dread Ecstasy,
                                    And life a brand which feeds thy flame.

                                    WINDING all my life about thee,
                                    Let me lay my lips on thine;
                                    What is all the world without thee,
                                    Mine —oh mine!
                                
                                
                                    Let me press my heart out on thee,
                                    Grape of life’s most fiery vine,
                                    Spilling sacramental on thee
                                    Love’s red wine.
                                
                                
                                    Let thy strong eyes yearning o’er me
                                    Draw me with their force divine;
                                    All my soul has gone before me
                                    Clasping thine.
                                
                                
                                    Irresistibly I follow,
                                    As whenever we may run
                                    Runs our shadow, as the swallow
                                    Seeks the sun. 
                                
                                
                                
                                    Yea, I tremble, swoon, surrender
                                    All my spirit to thy sway,
                                    As a star is drowned in splendour
                                    Of the day.

                                        with the wings of the dove,
                                    That ye blow o’er the brows of my Love, breathing low that I
                                        sicken for love.
                                
                                
                                    I charge you, O dews of the Dawn, O tears of the star of the
                                        morn,
                                    That ye fall at the feet of my love with the sound of one
                                        weeping forlorn.

                                        nest,
                                    That ye sing in his ears of the joy that for ever has fled
                                        from my breast.
                                
                                
                                    I charge you, O flowers of the Earth, O frailest of things,
                                        and most fair,
                                    That ye droop in his path as the life in me shrivels consumed
                                        by despair.
                                
                                
                                
                                    O Moon, when he lifts up his face, when he seeth the waning
                                        of thee,
                                    A memory of her who lies wan on the limits of life let it
                                        be.
                                
                                
                                    Many tears cannot quench, nor my sighs extinguish, the flames
                                        of love’s fire,
                                    Which lifteth my heart like a wave, and smites it, and breaks
                                        its desire.
                                
                                
                                    I rise like one in a dream when I see the red sun flaring
                                        low,
                                    That drags me back shuddering from sleep each morning to life
                                        with its woe.
                                
                                
                                    I go like one in a dream, unbidden my feet know the way
                                    To that garden where love stood in blossom with the red and
                                        white hawthorn of May.
                                
                                
                                    The song of the throstle is hushed, and the fountain is dry
                                        to its core,
                                    The moon cometh up as of old; she seeks, but she finds him no
                                        more.
                                
                                
                                
                                    The pale?faced, pitiful moon shines down on the grass where I
                                        weep,
                                    My face to the earth, and my breast in an anguish ne’er
                                        soothed into sleep.
                                
                                
                                    The moon returns, and the spring, birds warble, trees burst
                                        into leaf,
                                    But Love once gone, goes for ever, and all that endures is
                                        the grief.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                IV.
                                
                                    THOU walkest with me as the
                                        spirit?light
                                    Of the hushed moon, high o’er a snowy hill,
                                    Walks with the houseless traveller all the night,
                                    When trees are tongueless and when mute the
                                        rill.
                                    Moon of my soul, O phantasm of delight,
                                    Thou walkest with me still.
                                
                                
                                    The vestal flame of quenchless memory burns
                                    In my soul’s sanctuary. Yea, still for thee
                                    My bitter heart hath yearned, as moonward yearns
                                    Each separate wave?pulse of the clamorous
                                        sea:
                                    My Moon of love, to whom for ever turns
                                    The life that aches through me.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                V.
                                
                                    I THINK of thee in watches of the
                                        night,
                                    I feel thee near;
                                    Like mystic lamps consumed with too much light
                                    Thine eyes burn clear.
                                
                                
                                    The barriers that divide us in the day
                                    And hide from view,
                                    Like idle cobwebs now are brushed away
                                    Between us two.
                                
                                
                                    I probe the deep recesses of thy mind
                                    Without control,
                                    And in its inmost labyrinth I find
                                    My own lost soul.
                                
                                
                                    No longer like an exile on the earth
                                    I wildly roam,
                                    I was thy double from the hour of birth
                                    And thou my home.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                VI.
                                
                                    I WAS again beside thee in a dream:
                                    Earth was so beautiful, the moon was shining;
                                    The muffled voice of many a cataract stream
                                    Came like a love?song, as, with arms
                                        entwining,
                                    Our hearts were mixed in unison supreme.
                                
                                
                                    The wind lay spell?bound in each pillared pine,
                                    The tasselled larches had no sound or motion,
                                    As my whole life was sinking into thine—
                                    Sinking into a deep, unfathomed ocean
                                    Of infinite love—uncircumscribed, divine.
                                
                                
                                    Night held her breath, it seemed, with all her stars:
                                    Eternal eyes that watched in mute compassion
                                    Our little lives o’erleap their mortal bars,
                                    Fused in the fulness of immortal passion,
                                    A passion as immortal as the stars.
                                
                                
                                
                                    There was no longer any thee or me;
                                    No sense of self, no wish or incompleteness
                                    The moment, rounded to Eternity,
                                    Annihilated time’s destructive fleetness:
                                    For all but love itself had ceased to be.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                VII.
                                
                                    OUR souls have touched each other,
                                    Two fountains from one jet;
                                    Like children of one mother
                                    Our leaping thoughts have met.
                                
                                
                                    We were as far asunder
                                    As green isles in the sea;
                                    And now we ask in wonder
                                    How that could ever be.
                                
                                
                                    I dare not call thee lover
                                    Nor any earthly name,
                                    Though love’s full cup flows over
                                    As water quick with flame.
                                
                                
                                    When two strong minds have mated
                                    As only spirits may,
                                    The wold shines new created
                                    In a diviner day.
                                
                                
                                
                                    Yea, though hard fate may sever
                                    My fleeting self from thine,
                                    Thy thought will live for ever
                                    And ever grow in mine.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                VIII.
                                
                                    I AM athirst, but not for wine;
                                    The drink I long for is divine,
                                    Poured only from your eyes in mine.
                                
                                
                                    I hunger, but the bread I want,
                                    Of which my blood and brain are scant,
                                    Is your sweet speech, for which I pant.
                                
                                
                                    I am a?cold, and lagging lame,
                                    Life creeps along my languid frame;
                                    Your love would fan it into flame.
                                
                                
                                    Heaven’s in that little word—your love!
                                    It makes my heart coo like a dove,
                                    My tears fall as I think thereof.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                IX.
                                
                                    I WOULD I were the glow?worm, thou the
                                        flower,
                                    That I might fill thy cup with glimmering
                                        light;
                                    I would I were the bird, and thou the bower,
                                    To sing thee songs throughout the summer
                                        night.
                                
                                
                                    I would I were a pine tree deeply rooted,
                                    And thou the lofty, cloud?beleaguered rock,
                                    Still, while the blasts of heaven around us hooted,
                                    To cleave to thee and weather every shock.
                                
                                
                                    I would I were the rill, and thou the river;
                                    So might I, leaping from some headlong steep,
                                    With all my waters lost in thine for ever,
                                    Be hurried onwards to the unfathomed deep.
                                
                                
                                
                                    I would—what would I not? O foolish dreaming!
                                    My words are but as leaves by autumn shed,
                                    That, in the faded moonlight idly gleaming,
                                    Drop on the grave where all our love lies
                                        dead.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                X.
                                
                                    THE woods shake in an ague?fit,
                                    The mad wind rocks the pine,
                                    From sea to sea the white gulls flit
                                    Into the roaring brine.
                                
                                
                                    The moon as if in panic grief
                                    Darts through the clouds on high,
                                    Blown like a wild autumnal leaf
                                    Across the wilder sky.
                                
                                
                                    The gusty rain is driving fast,
                                    And through the rain we hear,
                                    Above the equinoctial blast,
                                    The thunder of the Weir.
                                
                                
                                    The voices of the wind and rain
                                    Wail echoing through my heart—
                                    That love is ever dogged by pain
                                    And fondest souls must part.
                                
                                
                                
                                    You made heart’s summer, O my friend,
                                    But now we bid adieu,
                                    There will be winter without end
                                    And tears for ever new.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XI.
                                
                                    DOST thou remember ever, for my sake,
                                    When we two rowed upon the rock?bound lake?
                                    How the wind?fretted waters blew their spray
                                    About our brows like blossom?falls of May
                                    One memorable day?
                                
                                
                                    Dost thou remember the glad mouth that cried—
                                    “Were it not sweet to die now side by side,
                                    To lie together tangled in the deep
                                    Close as the heart?beat to the heart—so keep
                                    The everlasting sleep?”
                                
                                
                                    Dost thou remember? Ah, such death as this
                                    Had set the seal upon my heart’s young bliss!
                                    But, wrenched asunder, severed and apart,
                                    Life knew a deadlier death: the blighting smart
                                    Which only kills the heart.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XII.
                                
                                    LIKE some wild sleeper who alone at
                                        night
                                    Walks with unseeing eyes along a height,
                                    With death below and only stars above;
                                    I, in broad daylight, walk as if in sleep,
                                    Along the edges of life’s perilous steep,
                                    The lost somnambulist of love.
                                
                                
                                    I, in broad day, go walking in a dream,
                                    Led on in safety by the starry gleam
                                    Of thy blue eyes that hold my heart in
                                        thrall;
                                    Let no one wake me rudely, lest one day,
                                    Startled to find how far I’ve gone astray,
                                    I dash my life out in my fall.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XIII.
                                
                                    O MOON, large golden summer moon,
                                    Hanging between the linden trees,
                                    Which in the intermittent breeze
                                    Beat with the rhythmic pulse of June!
                                
                                
                                    O night?air, scented through and through
                                    With honey?coloured flower of lime,
                                    Sweet now as in that other time
                                    When all my heart was sweet as you!
                                
                                
                                    The sorcery of this breathing bloom
                                    Works like enchantment in my brain,
                                    Till, shuddering back to life again,
                                    My dead self rises from its tomb.
                                
                                
                                    And, lovely with the love of yore,
                                    Its white ghost haunts the moon?white ways;
                                    But, when it meets me face to face,
                                    Flies trembling to the grave once more.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XIV.
                                
                                    I PLANTED a rose tree in my garden,
                                    In early days when the year was young;
                                    I thought it would bear me roses, roses,
                                    While nights were dewy and days were long.
                                
                                
                                    It bore me once, and a white rose only—
                                    A lovely rose with petals of light;
                                    Like the moon in heaven, supreme and lonely;
                                    And the lightning struck it one summer night.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XV.
                                
                                    WHY will you haunt me unawares,
                                    And walk into my sleep,
                                    Pacing its shadowy thoroughfares,
                                    Where long?dried perfume scents the airs,
                                    While ghosts of sorrow creep,
                                    Where on Hope’s ruined altar?stairs,
                                    With ineffectual beams,
                                    The Moon of Memory coldly glares
                                    Upon the land of dreams?
                                
                                
                                    My yearning eyes were fain to look
                                    Upon your hidden face;
                                    Their love, alas! you could not brook,
                                    But in your own you mutely took
                                    My hand, and for a space
                                    You wrung it till I throbbed and shook,
                                    And woke with wildest moan
                                    And wet face channeled like a brook
                                    With your tears or my own.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XVI.
                                
                                    WHEN you wake from troubled slumbers
                                    With a dream?bewildered brain,
                                    And old leaves which no man numbers
                                    Chattering tap against the pane;
                                    And the midnight wind is wailing
                                    Till you very life seems quailing
                                    As the long gusts shudder and sigh:
                                    Know you not that homeless cry
                                    Is my love’s, which cannot die,
                                    Wailing through Eternity?
                                
                                
                                    When beside the glowing embers,
                                    Sitting in the twilight lone,
                                    Drop on drop you hear November’s
                                    Melancholy monotone,
                                    As the heavy rain comes sweeping,
                                    With a sound of weeping, weeping,
                                    Till your blood is chilled with fears;
                                    Know you not those falling tears,
                                    
                                    Flowing fast through years on years,
                                    For my sobs within your ears?
                                
                                
                                    When with dolorous moan the billows
                                    Surge around where, far and wide,
                                    Leagues on leagues of sea?worn hollows
                                    Throb with thunders of the tide,
                                    And the weary waves in breaking
                                    Fill you, thrill you, as with aching
                                    Memories of our love of yore,
                                    Where you pace the sounding shore,
                                    Hear you not, through roll and roar,
                                    Soul call soul for evermore?
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XVII.
                                
                                    IN a lonesome burial?place
                                    Crouched a mourner white of face;
                                    Wild her eyes—unheeding
                                    Circling pomp of night and day—
                                    Ever crying, “Well away,
                                    Love lies a?bleeding!”
                                
                                
                                    And her sighs were like a knell,
                                    And her tears for ever fell,
                                    With their warm rain feeding
                                    That purpureal flower, alas!
                                    Trailing prostrate in the grass,
                                    Love lies a?bleeding.
                                
                                
                                    Through the yews’ black?tufted gloom
                                    Crimson light fell on the tomb,
                                    Funeral shadows breeding:
                                    
                                    In the sky the sun’s light shed
                                    Dyed the earth one awful red—
                                    Love lies a?bleeding.
                                
                                
                                    Came grey mists, and blanching cloud
                                    Bore one universal shroud;
                                    Came the bowed moon leading,
                                    From the infinite afar
                                    Star that rumoured unto star—
                                    Love that lies a?bleeding.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XVIII.
                                
                                    DEEP in a yew?sequestered grove
                                    I sat and wept my heart away;
                                    A child came by at close of day
                                    With eyes as sweet as new?born love.
                                
                                
                                    He came from sun?bleached meadows where
                                    High on the hedge the topmost rose
                                    Curtsies to every wind that blows.
                                    A wanton of the summer air.
                                
                                
                                    The sunset aureoled his brow,
                                    Kindling the roses in his hand,
                                    And by my side I saw him stand
                                    To offer me his rose?red bough:
                                
                                
                                    Take back thy gift—I sighed forlorn,
                                    And showed where like the yew’s red seed,
                                    My blood had trickled, bead on bead,
                                    From wounds made by his cruel thorn.
                                
                                
                                
                                    He smiled and said:—Nay, take my Rose;
                                    You know, when all is said and done,
                                    There’s not a joy beneath the sun
                                    Worth lovers’ joys but lovers’ woes.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XIX.
                                
                                    ON life’s long round by chance I found
                                    A dell impearled with dew;
                                    Where hyacinths, gushing from the ground,
                                    Lent to the earth heaven’s native hue
                                    Of holy blue.
                                
                                
                                    I sought that plot of azure light
                                    Once more in gloomy hours;
                                    But snow had fallen overnight
                                    And wrapped in mortuary white
                                    My fairy ring of flowers.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XX.
                                
                                    AH, yesterday was dark and drear,
                                    My heart was deadly sore;
                                    Without thy love it seemed, my Dear,
                                    That I could live no more.
                                
                                
                                    And yet I laugh and sing to?day;
                                    Care or care not for me,
                                    Thou canst not take the love away
                                    With which I worship thee.
                                
                                
                                    And if to?morrow, Dear, I live,
                                    My heart I shall not break:
                                    For still I hold it that to give
                                    Is sweeter than to take.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XXI.
                                I TOOK your face into my dreams,
                                It floated round me like a light;
                                Your beauty’s consecrating beams
                                Lay mirrored in my heart all night.
                                As in a lonely mountain mere,
                                Unvisited of any streams,
                                Supremely bright and still and clear,
                                The solitary moonlight gleams,
                                Your face was shining in my dreams.
                            
                            
                            
                                XXII.
                                
                                    WE met as strangers on life’s lonely
                                        way,
                                    And yet it seemed we knew each other well;
                                    There was no end to what thou hadst to say,
                                    Or to the thousand things I found to tell.
                                    My heart, long silent, at thy voice that day
                                    Chimed in my breast like to a silver bell.
                                
                                
                                    How much we spoke, and yet still left untold
                                    Some secret half revealed within our eyes:
                                    Didst thou not love me once in ages old?
                                    Had I not called thee with importunate cries,
                                    And, like a child left sobbing in the cold,
                                    Listened to catch from far thy fond replies?
                                
                                
                                    We met as strangers, and as such we part;
                                    Yet all my life seems leaving me with thine;
                                    Ah, to be clasped once only heart to heart,
                                    If only once to feel that thou wert mine!
                                    These lips are locked, and yet I know thou art
                                    That all in all for which my soul did pine.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XXIII.
                                
                                    YOU make the sunshine of my heart
                                    And its tempestuous shower;
                                    Sometimes the thought of you is like
                                    A lilac bush in flower,
                                    Yea, honey?sweet as hives in May.
                                    And then the pang of it will strike
                                    My bosom with a fiery smart,
                                    As though love’s deeply planted dart
                                    Drained all its life away.
                                
                                
                                    My thoughts hum round you, Dear, like bees
                                    About a bank of thyme,
                                    Or round the yellow blossoms of
                                    The heavy?scented lime.
                                    Ah, sweeter you than honeydew,
                                    Yet dark the ways of love,
                                    For it has robbed my soul of peace,
                                    And marred my life and turned heart’s?ease
                                    Into funereal rue.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XXIV.
                                
                                    AH, if you knew how soon and late
                                    My eyes long for a sight of you
                                    Sometimes in passing by my gate
                                    You’d linger until fall of dew,
                                    If you but knew!
                                
                                
                                    Ah, if you knew how sick and sore
                                    My life flags for the want of you,
                                    Straightway you’d enter at the door
                                    And clasp my hand between your two,
                                    If you but knew!
                                
                                
                                    Ah, if you knew how lost and lone
                                    I watch and weep and wait for you,
                                    You’d press my heart close to your own
                                    Till love had healed me through and through,
                                    If you but knew!
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XXV.
                                
                                    YOUR looks have touched my soul with
                                        bright
                                    Ineffable emotion;
                                    As moonbeams on a stormy night
                                    Illume with transitory light
                                    A seagull on her lonely flight
                                    Across the lonely ocean.
                                
                                
                                    Fluttering from out the gloom and roar,
                                    On fitful wing she flies,
                                    Moon?white above the moon?washed shore;
                                    Then, drowned in darkness as before,
                                    She’s lost, as I when lit no more
                                    By your beloved eyes.
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                XXVI.
                                
                                    WHAT magic is there in thy mien
                                    What sorcery in thy smile,
                                    Which charms away all cark and care,
                                    Which turns the foul days into fair,
                                    And for a little while
                                    Changes this disenchanted scene
                                    From the sere leaf into the green,
                                    Transmuting with love’s golden wand
                                    This beggared life to fairyland?
                                
                                
                                    My heart goes forth to thee, oh friend,
                                    As some poor pilgrim to a shrine,
                                    A pilgrim who has come from far
                                    To seek his spirit’s folding star,
                                    And sees the taper shine;
                                    The goal to which his wanderings tend,
                                    Where want and weariness shall end,
                                    And kneels ecstatically blest
                                    Because his heart hath entered rest.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            L’ENVOI.
                            
                                THOU art the goal for which my spirit
                                    longs;
                                As dove on dove,
                                Bound for one home, I send thee all my songs
                                With all my love.
                            
                            
                                Thou art the haven with fair harbour lights;
                                Safe locked in thee,
                                My heart would anchor after stormful nights
                                Alone at sea.
                            
                            
                                Thou art the rest of which my life is fain,
                                The perfect peace;
                                Absorbed in thee the world, with all its pain
                                And toil, would cease.
                            
                            
                                Thou art the heaven to which my soul would go!
                                O dearest eyes,
                                Lost in your light you would turn hell below
                                To Paradise.
                            
                            
                            
                                Thou all in all for which my heart?blood yearns!
                                Yea, near or far—
                                Where the unfathomed ether throbs and burns
                                With star on star,
                            
                            
                                Or where, enkindled by the fires of June,
                                The fresh earth glows,
                                Blushing beneath the mystical white moon
                                Through rose on rose—
                            
                            
                                Thee, thee, I see, thee feel in all live things,
                                Beloved one;
                                In the first bird which tremulously sings
                                Ere peep of sun;
                            
                            
                                In the last nestling orphaned in the hedge,
                                Rocked to and fro,
                                When dying summer shudders in the sedge,
                                And swallows go;
                            
                            
                                When roaring snows rush down the mountain?pass,
                                March floods with rills
                                Or April lightens through the living grass
                                In daffodils;
                            
                            
                            
                                When poppied cornfields simmer in the heat
                                With tare and thistle,
                                And, like winged clouds above the mellow wheat,
                                The starlings whistle;
                            
                            
                                When stained with sunset the wide moorlands glare
                                In the wild weather,
                                And clouds with flaming craters smoke and flare
                                Red o’er red heather;
                            
                            
                                When the bent moon, on frostbound midnights waking,
                                Leans to the snow
                                Like some world?mother whose deep heart is breaking
                                O’er human woe.
                            
                            
                                As the round sun rolls red into the ocean,
                                Till all the sea
                                Glows fluid gold, even so life’s mazy motion
                                Is dyed with thee:
                            
                            
                            
                                For as the wave?like years subside and roll,
                                O heart’s desire,
                                Thy soul glows interfused within my soul,
                                A quenchless fire.
                            
                            
                                Yea, thee I feel, all storms of life above,
                                Near though afar;
                                O thou my glorious morning star of love,
                                And evening star.

                            PAUPER POET’S SONG.
                            
                                SUN, moon, and stars, the ample air,
                                The birds shrill whistling everywhere,
                                Fields white with lambs and daisies;
                                The pearls of eve, the jewelled morn,
                                The rose rich blowing on the thorn,
                                The glow of blush?rose faces;
                                The silver glint of sun?smit rain,
                                The shattered sun?gold of the main,
                                And heaven’s sweet breath that moves it;
                                The earth, our myriad?bosomed nurse,
                                This whole miraculous universe
                                Belongs to him who loves it!
                            
                            
                                Why fret then for the gold of this,
                                The fame of that man, or the bliss,
                                Or such another’s graces?
                                Oh heart that chim’st with golden verse,
                                My heart, thou art the magic purse
                                Which all dull trouble chases;
                                
                                Thine too fruition of all fame
                                When the live soul, as flame with flame,
                                Weds the dead soul that moves it;
                                Then sing for aye, and aye rehearse,
                                This whole miraculous universe
                                Belongs to him who loves it!
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            SNOW OR SNOWDROPS?
                            
                                IS it snow or snowdrops’ shimmer
                                Whitens thus the bladed grass,
                                With a faint aërial glimmer,—
                                Spring or winter, which did pass?
                                For the sky is dim and tender
                                With an evanescent light,
                                And the fading fields are white,
                                White with snow or snowdrops, under
                                The fair firstling stars of night.
                            
                            
                                Little robin, softly, cheerly
                                Piping on yon wintry bough,
                                Why have all the fields that pearly
                                Iridescence, knowest thou?
                                Did old Winter, grim and hoary,
                                Aim a parting dart at Spring
                                As she fled on azure wing,
                                Or did she with rainbow glory
                                In his face her snowdrops fling?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            A SPRING SONG.
                            
                                DARK sod pierced by flames of flowers,
                                Dead wood freshly quickening,
                                Bright skies dusked with sudden showers,
                                Lit by rainbows on the wing.
                            
                            
                                Cuckoo calls and young lambs’ bleating,
                                Nimble airs which coyly bring
                                Little gusts of tender greeting
                                From shy nooks where violets cling.
                            
                            
                                Half?fledged buds and birds and vernal
                                Fields of grass dew?glistening;
                                Evanescent life’s eternal
                                Resurrection, bridal Spring!
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            “ALL MY HEART IS STIRRING LIGHTLY.”
                            
                                ALL my heart is stirring lightly
                                Like dim violets winter?bound,
                                Quickening as they feel the brightly
                                Glowing sunlight underground.
                            
                            
                                Yea, this drear and silent bosom,
                                Hushed as snow?hid grove but now,
                                Breaketh into leaf and blossom
                                Like a gleaming vernal bough.
                            
                            
                                Oh the singing, singing, singing!
                                Callow hopes that thrill my breast!
                                Can the lark of love be winging
                                Back to its abandoned nest?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            APRIL RAIN.
                            
                                THE April rain, the April
                                    rain,
                                Comes slanting down in fitful showers,
                                Then from the furrow shoots the grain,
                                And banks are fledged with nestling flowers;
                                And in grey shaw and woodland bowers
                                The cuckoo through the April rain
                                Calls once again.
                            
                            
                                The April sun, the April sun,
                                Glints through the rain in fitful splendour,
                                And in grey shaw and woodland dun
                                The little leaves spring forth and tender
                                Their infant hands, yet weak and slender,
                                For warmth towards the April sun,
                                One after one.
                            
                            
                                And between shower and shine hath birth
                                The rainbow’s evanescent glory;
                                
                                Heaven’s light that breaks on mists of earth!
                                Frail symbol of our human story,
                                It flowers through showers where, looming hoary,
                                The rain?clouds flash with April mirth,
                                Like Life on earth.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            APPLE?BLOSSOM.
                            
                                BLOSSOM of the apple trees!
                                Mossy trunks all gnarled and hoary,
                                Grey boughs tipped with rose?veined glory,
                                Clustered petals soft as fleece
                                Garlanding old apple trees!
                            
                            
                                How you gleam at break of day!
                                When the coy sun, glancing rarely,
                                Pouts and sparkles in the pearly
                                Pendulous dewdrops, twinkling gay
                                On each dancing leaf and spray.
                            
                            
                                Through your latticed boughs on high,
                                Framed in rosy wreaths, one catches
                                Brief kaleidoscopic snatches
                                Of deep lapis?lazuli
                                In the April?coloured sky.
                            
                            
                            
                                When the sundown’s dying brand
                                Leaves your beauty to the tender
                                Magic spells of moonlight splendour,
                                Glimmering clouds of bloom you stand,
                                Turning earth to fairyland.
                            
                            
                                Cease, wild winds, O, cease to blow!
                                Apple?blossom, fluttering, flying,
                                Palely on the green turf lying,
                                Vanishing like winter snow;
                                Swift as joy to come and go.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            THE MUSIC?LESSON.
                            
                                A THRUSH alit on a young?leaved spray,
                                And, lightly clinging,
                                It rocked in its singing
                                As the rapturous notes rose loud and gay;
                                And with liquid shakes,
                                And trills and breaks,
                                Rippled though blossoming bough of May.
                            
                            
                                Like a ball of fluff, with a warm brown throat
                                And throbbing bosom,
                                ’Mid the apple?blossom,
                                The new?fledged nestling sat learning by rote
                                To echo the song
                                So tender and strong,
                                As it feebly put in its frail little note.
                            
                            
                                O blissfullest lesson amid the green grove!
                                The low wind crispeth
                                The leaves, where lispeth
                                
                                The shy little bird with its parent above;
                                Two voices that mingle
                                And make but a single
                                Hymn of rejoicing in praise of their love.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            “ONCE ON A GOLDEN DAY.”
                            
                                ONCE on a golden day,
                                In the golden month of May,
                                I gave my heart away—
                                Little birds were singing.
                            
                            
                                I culled my heart in truth,
                                Wet with the dews of youth,
                                For love to take, forsooth—
                                Little flowers were springing.
                            
                            
                                Love sweetly laughed at this,
                                And between kiss and kiss
                                Fled with my heart in his:
                                Winds warmly blowing.
                            
                            
                                And with his sun and shower
                                Love kept my heart in flower,
                                As in the greenest bower
                                Rose richly glowing.
                            
                            
                            
                                Till, worn at evensong,
                                Love dropped my heart among
                                Stones by the way ere long;
                                Misprizèd token.
                            
                            
                                There in the wind and rain,
                                Trampled and rent in twain,
                                Ne’er to be whole again,
                                My heart lies broken.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            ROSE D’AMOUR.
                            
                                OH haste while roses bloom below,
                                Oh haste while pale and bright above
                                The sun and moon alternate glow,
                                To pluck the rose of love.
                            
                            
                                Yea, give the morning to the lark,
                                The nightingale its glimmering grove,
                                Give moonlight to the hungry dark,
                                But to man’s heart give love!
                            
                            
                                Then haste while still the roses blow,
                                And pale and bright in heaven above
                                The sun and moon alternate glow,
                                Pluck, pluck the rose of love.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            ONLY A SMILE.
                            
                                NO butterfly whose frugal fare
                                Is breath of heliotrope and clove,
                                And other trifles light as air,
                                Could live on less than doth my love.
                            
                            
                                That childlike smile that comes and goes
                                About your gracious lips and eyes,
                                Hath all the sweetness of the rose,
                                Which feeds the freckled butterflies.
                            
                            
                                I feed my love on smiles, and yet
                                Sometimes I ask, with tears of woe,
                                How had it been if we had met,
                                If you had met me long ago,
                            
                            
                                Before the fast, defacing years
                                Had made all ill that once was well?
                                Ah, then your smiling breeds such tears
                                As Tantalus may weep in hell.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            THE SONGS OF SUMMER.
                            
                                THE songs of summer are over and past!
                                The swallow’s forsaken the dripping eaves;
                                Ruined and black ’mid the sodden leaves
                                The nests are rudely swung in the blast:
                                And ever the wind like a soul in pain
                                Knocks and knocks at the window?pane.
                            
                            
                                The songs of summer are over and past!
                                Woe’s me for a music sweeter than theirs—
                                The quick, light bound of a step on the stairs,
                                The greeting of lovers too sweet to last:
                                And ever the wind like a soul in pain
                                Knocks and knocks at the window?pane.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            “YEA, THE ROSES ARE STILL ON FIRE.”
                            
                                YEA, the roses are still on fire
                                With the bygone heat of July,
                                Though the least little wind drifting by
                                Shake a rose?leaf or two from the brier,
                                Be it never so soft a sigh.
                            
                            
                                Ember of love still glows and lingers
                                Deep at the red heart’s smouldering core;
                                With the sudden passionate throb of yore
                                We shook as our eyes and clinging fingers
                                Met once only to meet no more.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            AUTUMN TINTS.
                            
                                CORAL?COLOURED yew?berries
                                Strew the garden ways,
                                Hollyhocks and sunflowers
                                Make a dazzling blaze
                                In these latter days.
                            
                            
                                Marigolds by cottage doors
                                Flaunt their golden pride,
                                Crimson?punctured bramble leaves
                                Dapple far and wide
                                The green mountain?side.
                            
                            
                                Far away, on hilly slopes
                                Where fleet rivulets run,
                                Miles on miles of tangled fern,
                                Burnished by the sun,
                                Glow a copper dun.
                            
                            
                            
                                For the year that’s on the wane,
                                Gathering all its fire,
                                Flares up through the kindling world
                                As, ere they expire,
                                Flames leap high and higher.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            ON AND ON.
                            
                                By long leagues of wood and meadow
                                On and on we drive apace;
                                In the dreamy light and shadow
                                Veiling earth’s autumnal face.
                            
                            
                                Rosy clouds are drifting o’er us,
                                Rooks rise parleying from their tryst,
                                And the road lies far before us,
                                Fading into amethyst.
                            
                            
                                On and on, through leagues of heather,
                                Deeps of scarlet beaded lane,
                                Like a pheasant’s golden feather
                                Golden leaves around us rain.
                            
                            
                                On and on, where woodlands hoary,
                                In October’s lavish fire,
                                
                                Flame up with unearthly glory,
                                Beauteous summer’s funeral pyre.
                            
                            
                                On and on, where casements blinking
                                Lighten into transient gules,
                                As the dying day in sinking
                                Splashes all the wayside pools.
                            
                            
                                On and on; the land grows dimmer,
                                And our road recedes afar;
                                While on either hand there glimmer
                                Setting sun and rising star.
                            
                            
                                Would I knew what thoughts steal o’er you,
                                As the long road lengthens yet:
                                Ah, like hope it winds before you,
                                And behind me like regret.

                                For when the stars begin to peep,
                                The pretty daisies go to sleep.

                                They’ve shut their eyes so golden?gay,
                                That looked up through the long, long day.

                                Playing their game at hide?and?seek;—

                                Looked down from heaven and sweetly smiled;
                                But not a star in all the skies
                                Beamed on him with his Mother’s eyes.

                                And whispering very softly, said,
                                “I’d quite forgotten they might hear;
                                Thank you for that reminder, dear.”

                                Prince Charming in the forest found,
                                And kissed in loyal duty:
                                And when she woke her eyes’ blue fire
                                Turned the dumb forest to a lyre.
                            
                            
                                Thus Amor with the bandaged eyes,
                                Fit symbol of hushed numbers,
                                Most musically wakes and sighs
                                After an age of slumbers:
                                Beneath your magic bow’s control
                                The Viol has regained her soul.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            BROWN EYES.
                            
                                OH, brown Eyes with long black lashes,
                                Young brown Eyes,
                                Depths of night from which there flashes
                                Lightning as of summer skies,
                                Beautiful brown Eyes!
                            
                            
                                In your veiled mysterious splendour
                                Passion lies
                                Sleeping, but with sudden tender
                                Dreams that fill with vague surmise
                                Beautiful brown Eyes.
                            
                            
                                All my soul, with yearning shaken,
                                Asks in sighs—
                                Who will see your heart awaken,
                                Love’s divine sunrise
                                In those young brown Eyes?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            MY LADY.
                            
                                LIKE putting forth upon a sea
                                On which the moonbeams shimmer,
                                Where reefs and unknown perils be
                                To wreck, yea, wreck one utterly,
                                It were to love you, lady fair,
                                In whose black braids of billowy hair
                                The misty moonstones glimmer.
                            
                            
                                Oh, misty moonstone?coloured eye,
                                Latticed behind long lashes,
                                Within whose clouded orbs there lies,
                                Like lightning in the sleeping skies,
                                A spark to kindle and ignite,
                                And set a fire of love alight
                                To burn one’s heart to ashes.
                            
                            
                                I will not put forth on this deep
                                Of perilous emotion;
                                
                                No, though your hands be soft as sleep,
                                They shall not have my heart to keep,
                                Nor draw it to your fatal sphere.
                                Lady, you are as much to fear
                                As is the fickle ocean.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            SOMETIMES I WONDER.
                            
                                SOMETIMES I wonder if you guess
                                The deep impassioned tenderness
                                Which overflows my heart;
                                The love I never dare confess;
                                Yet hard, yea, harder to repress
                                Than tears too fain to start.
                            
                            
                                Sometimes I ponder, O my sweet,
                                The things I’ll tell you when we meet;
                                But straightway at your sight
                                My heart’s blood oozes to my feet
                                Like thawing waters in the heat,
                                Confused with too much light.
                            
                            
                                I hardly know, when you are near,
                                If it is love, or joy, or fear
                                Which fills my languid frame;
                                Enveloped in your atmosphere,
                                My dark self seems to disappear,
                                A moth entombed in flame.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            MANY WILL LOVE YOU.
                            
                                MANY will love you; you were made for
                                    love;
                                For the soft plumage of the unruffled dove
                                Is not so soft as your caressing eyes.
                                You will love many; for the winds that veer
                                Are not more prone to shift their compass, dear,
                                Than your quick fancy flies.
                            
                            
                                Many will love you; but I may not, no;
                                Even though your smile sets all my life aglow,
                                And at your fairness all my senses ache.
                                You will love many; but not me, my dear,
                                Who have no gift to give you but a tear
                                Sweet for your sweetness’ sake.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            A DREAM.
                            
                                ONLY a dream, a beautiful baseless dream;
                                Only a bright
                                Flash from your eyes, a brief electrical gleam,
                                Charged with delight.
                            
                            
                                Only a waking, alone, in the moon’s last gleam
                                Fading from sight;
                                Only a flooding of tears that shudder and stream
                                Fast through the night.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            GREEN LEAVES AND SERE.
                            
                                THREE tall poplars beside the pool
                                Shiver and moan in the gusty blast,
                                The carded clouds are blown like wool,
                                And the yellowing leaves fly thick and fast.
                            
                            
                                The leaves, now driven before the blast,
                                Now flung by fits on the curdling pool,
                                Are tossed heaven?high and dropped at last
                                As if at the whim of a jabbering fool.
                            
                            
                                O leaves, once rustling green and cool!
                                Two met here where one moans aghast
                                With wild heart heaving towards the past:
                                Three tall poplars beside the pool.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            THE HUNTER’S MOON.
                            
                                THE Hunter’s Moon rides high,
                                High o’er the close?cropped plain;
                                Across the desert sky
                                The herded clouds amain
                                Scamper tumultuously,
                                Chased by the hounding wind
                                That yelps behind.
                            
                            
                                The clamorous hunt is done,
                                Warm?housed the kennelled pack;
                                One huntsman rides alone
                                With dangling bridle slack;
                                He wakes a hollow tone,
                                Far echoing to his horn
                                In clefts forlorn.
                            
                            
                                The Hunter’s Moon rides low,
                                Her course is nearly sped.
                                
                                Where is the panting roe?
                                Where hath the wild deer fled?
                                Hunter and hunted now
                                Lie in oblivion deep:
                                Dead or asleep.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            A PARTING.
                            
                                THE year is on the wing, my love,
                                With tearful days and nights;
                                The clouds are on the wing above
                                With gathering swallow?flights.
                            
                            
                                The year is on the wing, my sweet,
                                And in the ghostly race,
                                With patter of unnumbered feet,
                                The dead leaves fly apace.
                            
                            
                                The year is on the wing, and shakes
                                The last rose from its tree;
                                And I, whose heart in parting breaks,
                                Must bid adieu to thee.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            LASSITUDE.
                            
                                I LAID me down beside the sea,
                                Endless in blue monotony;
                                The clouds were anchored in the sky.
                                Sometimes a sail went idling by.
                            
                            
                                Upon the shingles on the beach
                                Grey linen was spread out to bleach,
                                And gently with a gentle swell
                                The languid ripples rose and fell.
                            
                            
                                A fisher?boy, in level line,
                                Cast stone by stone into the brine:
                                Methought I too might do as he,
                                And cast my sorrows on the sea.
                            
                            
                                The old, old sorrows in a heap
                                Dropped heavily into the deep;
                                But with its sorrow on that day
                                My heart itself was cast away.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            SEEKING.
                            
                                IN many a shape and fleeting apparition,
                                Sublime in age or with clear morning eyes,
                                Ever I seek thee, tantalising Vision,
                                Which beckoning flies.
                            
                            
                                Ever I seek Thee, O evasive Presence,
                                Which on the far horizon’s utmost verge,
                                Like some wild star in luminous evanescence,
                                Shoots o’er the surge.
                            
                            
                                Ever I seek Thy features ever flying,
                                Which ne’er beheld I never can forget:
                                Lightning which flames through love, and mimics dying
                                In souls that set.
                            
                            
                                Ever I seek Thee through all clouds of error;
                                As when the moon behind earth’s shadow slips,
                                
                                She wears a momentary mask of terror
                                In brief eclipse.
                            
                            
                                Ever I seek Thee, passionately yearning;
                                Like altar?fire on some forgotten fane,
                                My life flames up irrevocably burning,
                                And burnt in vain.

                                O’er glooms unfathomed, limitless, below.

                                    seas,
                                Metals and odorous woods and cunning gold,

                                Nature gave unto Man; and last her keys
                                Vouched passage to her secret ways of old
                                Whence knowledge should be wrung, nay power to mould
                                Out of the rough, his occult destinies.

                                From his deep wish there sprang, full?armed, to cope
                                With all life’s ills, even very death in love,
                                The only thing man never wearies of—
                                His own creation—visionary Hope.

                                Earth seems to grip them, they are with us still:
                                They have forged our chains of being for good or ill;
                                And their invisible hands these hands yet hold.
                                Our perishable bodies are the mould
                                In which their strong imperishable will—
                                Mortality’s deep yearning to fulfil—
                                Hath grown incorporate through dim time untold.

                                So may we hold our lives, that when we are
                                The fate of those who then will draw this breath,
                                They shall not drag us to their judgment bar,
                                And curse the heritage which we bequeath.

                                THY life, O Man, in this brief moment
                                    lies:
                                Time’s narrow bridge whereon we darkling stand,
                                With an infinitude on either hand
                                Receding luminously from our eyes.
                                Lo, there thy Past’s forsaken Paradise
                                Subsideth like some visionary strand,
                                While glimmering faint, the Future’s promised
                                    land,
                                Illusive from the abyss, seems fain to rise.
                            
                            
                                This hour alone Hope’s broken pledges mar,
                                And joy now gleams before, now in our rear,
                                Like mirage mocking in some waste afar,
                                Dissolving into air as we draw near.
                                Beyond our steps the path is sunny?clear,
                                The shadow lying only where we are.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            A SYMBOL.
                            
                                HURRYING for ever in their restless flight
                                The generations of earth’s teeming womb
                                Rise into being and lapse into the tomb
                                Like transient bubbles sparkling in the light;
                                They sink in quick succession out of sight
                                Into the thick insuperable gloom
                                Our futile lives in flashing by illume—
                                Lightning which mocks the darkness of the night.
                            
                            
                                Nay—but consider, though we change and die,
                                If men must pass shall Man not still remain?
                                As the unnumbered drops of summer rain
                                Whose changing particles unchanged on high,
                                Fixed, in perpetual motion, yet maintain
                                The mystic bow emblazoned on the sky.

                                Schooled in the baffling mystery of pain,
                                Who on life’s anvil bear the fateful strain,
                                Wrong as forged iron, hammered blow on blow.
                                Take counsel with your grief, in that you know,
                                That he who suffers suffers not in vain,
                                Nay, that it shall be for the whole world’s gain,
                                And wisdom prove the priceless price of woe.
                            
                            
                                Thus in some new?found land where no man’s feet
                                Have trod a path, bold voyagers astray,
                                May fall foredone by torturing thirst and heat:
                                But from the impotent body of defeat—
                                The winners spring who carve a conquering way—
                                Measured by milestones of their perished clay.

                                While vaulting round his adamantine steep
                                Embattled breakers clamorously leap,

                                    moon,
                                Most pitiful and mother?hearted Night!
                                Blest armistice in life’s tumultuous fight,
                                Resolving discords to a spheral tune!
                                When tired with heat and strenuous toil of noon,
                                With ceaseless conflict betwixt might and right,
                                With ebb and flow of sorrow and delight,
                                Our panting hearts beneath their burdens swoon:
                            
                            
                                To thee, O star?eyes comforter, we creep,
                                Earth’s ill?used step?children to thee make moan,
                                As hiding in thy dark skirts’ ample sweep;
                                —Poor debtors whose brief life is not their own;
                                For dunned by Death, to whom we owe its loan,
                                Give us, O Night, the interest paid in sleep.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            DEAD LOVE.
                            
                                MOTHER of the unfortunate, mystic form,
                                Who calm, immutable, like oldest fate,
                                Sittest, where through the sombre swinging gate
                                Moans immemorial life’s encircling storm.
                                My heart, sore stricken by grief’s leaden arm,
                                Lags like a weary pilgrim knocking late,
                                And sigheth—toward thee staggering with its weight—
                                Behold Love conquered by thy son, the worm!
                            
                            
                                He stung him mid the roses’ purple bloom,
                                The Rose of roses, yea, a thing so sweet,
                                Haply to stay blind Change’s flying feet,
                                And stir with pity the unpitying tomb.
                                Here, take him, cold, cold, heavy and void of breath!
                                Nor me refuse, O Mother almighty, death.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            DESPAIR.
                            
                                THY wings swoop darkening round my soul,
                                    Despair!
                                And on my brain thy shadow seems to brood
                                And hem me round with stifling solitude,
                                With chasms of vacuous bloom which are thy lair.
                                No light of human joy, no song or prayer,
                                Breaks ever on this chaos, all imbrued
                                With heart’s?blood trickling from the multitude
                                Of sweet hopes slain, or agonising there.
                            
                            
                                Lo, wilt thou yield thyself to grief, and roll
                                Vanquished from thy high seat, imperial brain,
                                And abdicating turbulent life’s control,
                                Be dragged a captive bound in sorrow’s chain?
                                Nay! though my heart is breaking with its pain,
                                No pain on earth has power to crush my soul.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            TO MEMORY.
                            
                                OH in this dearth and winter of the soul,
                                When even Hope, still wont to soar and sing,
                                Droopeth, a starveling bird whose downy wing
                                Stiffens ere dead through the dank drift it fall—
                                Yea, ere Hope perish utterly, I call
                                On thee, fond Memory, that thou haste and bring
                                One leaf, one blossom from that far?off spring
                                When love’s auroral light lay over all.
                            
                            
                                Bring but one pansy: haply so the thrill
                                Of poignant yearning for those glad dead years
                                May, like the gusty south, breathe o’er the chill
                                Of frozen grief, dissolving it in tears,
                                Till numb Hope, stirred by that warm dropping rain,
                                Will deem, perchance, Love’s springtide come again.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            SAVING LOVE.
                            
                                WOULD we but love what will not pass away!
                                The sun that on each morning shines as clear
                                As when it rose first on the world’s first year;
                                The fresh green leaves that rustle on the spray.
                                The sun will shine, the leaves will be as gay
                                When graves are full of all our hearts held dear,
                                When not a soul of those who loved us here,
                                Not one, is left us—creatures of decay.
                            
                            
                                Yea, love the Abiding in the Universe
                                Which was before, and will be after us.
                                Nor yet for ever hanker and vainly cry
                                For human love—the beings that change or die;
                                Die—change—forget: to care so is a curse,
                                Yet cursed we’ll be rather than not care thus.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            HAUNTED STREETS.
                            
                                LO, haply walking in some clattering
                                    street—
                                Where throngs of men and women dumbly pass,
                                Like shifting pictures seen within a glass
                                Which leave no trace behind—one seems to meet,
                                In roads once trodden by our mutual feet,
                                A face projected from that shadowy mass
                                Of faces, quite familiar as it was,
                                Which beaming on us stands out clear and sweet.
                            
                            
                                The face of faces we again behold
                                That lit our life when life was very fair,
                                And leaps our heart toward eyes and mouth and hair:
                                Oblivious of the undying love grown cold,
                                Or body sheeted in the churchyard mould,
                                We stretch out yearning hands and grasp—the air.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            MOTHERHOOD.
                            
                                FROM out the front of being, undefiled,
                                A life hath been upheaved with struggle and pain;
                                Safe in her arms a mother holds again
                                That dearest miracle—a new?born child.
                                To moans of anguish terrible and wild—
                                As shrieks the night?wind through an ill?shut
                                    pane—
                                Pure heaven succeeds; and after fiery strain
                                Victorious woman smiles serenely mild.
                            
                            
                                Yea, shall she not rejoice, shall not her frame
                                Thrill with a mystic rapture! At this birth,
                                The soul now kindled by her vital flame
                                May it not prove a gift of priceless worth?
                                Some saviour of his kind whose starry fame
                                Shall bring a brightness to the darkened earth.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            THE AFTER?GLOW.
                            
                                IT is a solemn evening, golden?clear—
                                The Alpine summits flame with rose?lit snow
                                And headlands purpling on wide seas below,
                                And clouds and woods and arid rocks appear
                                Dissolving in the sun’s own atmosphere
                                And vast circumference of light, whose slow
                                Transfiguration—glow and after?glow—
                                Turns twilight earth to a more luminous sphere.
                            
                            
                                Oh heart, I ask, seeing that the orb of day
                                Has sunk below, yet left to sky and sea
                                His glory’s spiritual after?shine:
                                I ask if Love, whose sun hath set for thee,
                                May not touch grief with his memorial ray,
                                And lend to loss itself a joy divine?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            TO THE OBELISK
                            DURING THE GREAT FROST, 1881.
                            
                                THOU sign?post of the Desert! Obelisk,
                                Once fronting in thy monumental pride
                                Egypt’s fierce sun, that blazing far and wide,
                                Sheared her of tree and herb, till like a disk
                                Her waste stretched shadowless, and fraught with risk
                                To those who with their beasts of burden hied
                                Across the seas of sand until they spied
                                Thy pillar, and their flagging hearts grew brisk:
                            
                            
                                Now reared beside out Thames so wintry grey,
                                Where blocks of ice drift with the drifting stream,
                                Thou risest o’er the alien prospect! Say,
                                Yon dull, blear, rayless orb whose lurid gleam
                                Tinges the snow?draped ships and writhing steam,
                                Is this the sun which fired thine orient day?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            MANCHESTER BY NIGHT.
                            
                                O’ER this huge town, rife with intestine
                                    wars,
                                Whence as from monstrous sacrificial shrines
                                Pillars of smoke climb heavenward, Night inclines
                                Black brows majestical with glimmering stars.
                                Her dewy silence soothes life’s angry jars:
                                And like a mother’s wan white face, who pines
                                Above her children’s turbulent ways, so shines
                                The moon athwart the narrow cloudy bars.
                            
                            
                                Now toiling multitudes that hustling crush
                                Each other in the fateful strife for breath,
                                And, hounded on by diverse hungers, rush
                                Across the prostrate ones that groan beneath,
                                Are swathed within the universal hush,
                                As life exchanges semblances with death.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            THE RED SUNSETS, 1883.
                            
                                THE twilight heavens are flushed with
                                    gathering light,
                                And o’er wet roofs and huddling streets below
                                Hang with a strange Apocalyptic glow
                                On the black fringes of the wintry night.
                                Such bursts of glory may have rapt the sight
                                Of him to whom on Patmos long ago
                                The visionary angel came to show
                                That heavenly city built of chrysolite.
                            
                            
                                And lo, three factory hands begrimed with soot,
                                Aflame with the red splendour, marvelling stand,
                                And gaze with lifted faces awed and mute.
                                Starved of earth’s beauty by Man’s grudging hand,
                                O toilers, robbed of labour’s golden fruit,
                                Ye, too, may feast in Nature’s fairyland.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            THE RED SUNSETS, 1883.
                            
                                THE boding sky was charactered with cloud,
                                The scripture of the storm—but high in air,
                                Where the unfathomed zenith still was bare,
                                A pure expanse of rose?flushed violet glowed
                                And, kindling into crimson light, o’erflowed
                                The hurrying wrack with such a blood?red glare,
                                That heaven, igniting, wildly seemed to flare
                                On the dazed eyes of many an awe?struck crowd.
                            
                            
                                And in far lands folk presaged with blanched lips
                                Disastrous wars, earthquakes, and foundering ships,
                                Such whelming floods as never dykes could stem,
                                Or some proud empire’s ruin and eclipse:
                                Lo, such a sky, they cried, as burned o’er them
                                Once lit the sacking of Jerusalem!
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            THE SLEEPING BEAUTY.
                            
                                THERE was intoxication in the air;
                                The wind, keen blowing from across the seas,
                                O’er leagues of new?ploughed land and heathery
                                    leas,
                                Smelt of wild gorse whose gold flamed everywhere.
                                And undertone of song pulsed far and near,
                                The soaring larks filled heaven with ecstasies,
                                And, like a living clock among the trees,
                                The shouting cuckoo struck the time of year.
                            
                            
                                For now the Sun had found the earth once more,
                                And woke the Sleeping Beauty with a kiss;
                                Who thrilled with light of love in every pore,
                                Opened her flower?blue eyes, and looked in his.
                                Then all things felt life fluttering at their core—
                                The world shook mystical in lambent bliss.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            THE ROBIN REDBREAST.
                            
                                THE year’s grown songless! No glad pipings
                                    thrill
                                The hedge?row elms, whose wind?worn branches
                                    shower
                                Their leaves on the sere grass, where some late
                                    flower
                                In golden chalice hoards the sunlight still.
                                Our summer guests, whose raptures used to fill
                                Each apple?blossomed garth and honeyed bower,
                                Have in adversity’s inclement hour
                                Abandoned us to bleak November’s chill.
                            
                            
                                But hearken! Yonder russet bird among
                                The crimson clusters of the homely thorn
                                Still bubbles o’er with little rills of song—
                                A blending of sweet hope and resignation:
                                Even so, when life of love and youth is shorn,
                                One friend becomes its last, best consolation.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            A WINTER LANDSCAPE.
                            
                                ALL night, all day, in dizzy, downward
                                    flight,
                                Fell the wild?whirling, vague, chaotic snow,
                                Till every landmark of the earth below,
                                Trees, moorlands, roads, and each familiar sight
                                Were blotted out by the bewildering white.
                                And winds, now shrieking loud, now whimpering
                                    low,
                                Seemed lamentations for the world?old woe
                                That death must swallow life, and darkness light.
                            
                            
                                But all at once the rack was blown away,
                                The snowstorm hushing ended in a sigh;
                                Then like a flame the crescent moon on high
                                Leaped forth among the planets; pure as they,
                                Earth vied in whiteness with the Milky Way:
                                Herself a star beneath the starry sky.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            ON THE LIGHTHOUSE AT ANTIBES.
                            
                                A STORMY light of sunset glows and glares
                                Between two banks of cloud, and o’er the brine
                                Thy fair lamp on the sky’s carnation line
                                Alone on the lone promontory flares:
                                Friend of the Fisher who at nightfall fares
                                Where lurk false reefs masked by the hyaline
                                Of dimpling waves, within whose smile divine
                                Death lies in wait behind Circean snares.
                            
                            
                                The evening knows thee ere the evening star;
                                Or sees that flame sole Regent of the bight,
                                When storm, hoarse rumoured by the hills afar,
                                Makes mariners steer landward by thy light,
                                Which shows through shock of hostile nature’s war
                                How man keeps watch o’er man through deadliest
                                    night.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            BEAUTY.
                            
                                EVEN as on some black background full of
                                    night
                                And hollow storm in cloudy disarray,
                                The forceful brush of some great master may
                                More brilliantly evoke a higher light;
                                So beautiful, so delicately white,
                                So like a very metaphor of May,
                                Your loveliness on my life’s sombre grey
                                In its perfection stands out doubly bright.
                            
                            
                                And yet your beauty breeds a strange despair,
                                And pang of yearning in the helpless heart;
                                To shield you from time’s fraying wear and tear,
                                That from yourself yourself would wrench apart,
                                How save you, fairest, but to set you where
                                Mortality kills death in deathless art?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            IN THE ST. GOTTHARDT PASS.
                            
                                THE storm which shook the silence of the
                                    hills
                                And sleeping pinnacles of ancient snow
                                Went muttering off in one last thunder throe
                                Mixed with a moan of multitudinous rills;
                                Yea, even as one who has wept much, but stills
                                The flowing tears of some convulsive woe
                                When a fair light of hope begins to glow
                                Athwart the gloom of long remembered ills:
                            
                            
                                So does the face of this scarred mountain height
                                Relax its stony frown, while slow uprolled
                                Invidious mists are changed to veiling gold.
                                Wild peaks still fluctuate between dark and bright,
                                But when the sun laughs at them, as of old,
                                They kiss high heaven in all embracing light.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            CAGNES.
                            ON THE RIVIERA.
                            
                                IN tortuous windings up the steep incline
                                The sombre street toils to the village square,
                                Whose antique walls in stone and moulding bear
                                Dumb witness to the Moor. Afar off shine,
                                With tier on tier, cutting heaven’s blue divine,
                                The snowy Alps; and lower the hills are fair,
                                With wave?green olives rippling down to where
                                Gold clusters hang and leaves of sunburnt vine.
                            
                            
                                You may perchance, I never shall forget
                                When, between twofold glory of land and sea,
                                We leant together o’er the old parapet,
                                And saw the sun go down. For, oh, to me,
                                The beauty of that beautiful strange place
                                Was its reflection beaming from your face.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            HEART’S?EASE.
                            
                                AS opiates to the sick on wakeful nights,
                                As light to flowers, as flowers in poor men’s
                                    rooms,
                                As to the fisher when the tempest glooms
                                The cheerful twinkling of his village lights;
                                As emerald isles to flagging swallow flights,
                                As roses garlanding with tendrilled blooms
                                The unweeded hillocks of forgotten tombs,
                                As singing birds on cypress?shadowed heights,
                            
                            
                                Thou art to me—a comfort past compare—
                                For thy joy?kindling presence, sweet as May,
                                Sets all my nerves to music, makes away
                                With sorrow and the numbing frost of care,
                                Until the influence of thine eyes’ bright sway
                                Has made life’s glass go up from foul to fair.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            UNTIMELY LOVE.
                            
                                PEACE, throbbing heart, nor let us shed one
                                    tear
                                O’er this late love’s unseasonable glow;
                                Sweet as a violet blooming in the snow,
                                The posthumous offspring of the widowed year
                                That smells of March when all the world is sere,
                                And, while around the hurtling sea?winds blow—
                                Which twist the oak and lay the pine tree low—
                                Stands childlike in the storm and has no fear.
                            
                            
                                Poor helpless blossom orphaned of the sun,
                                How could it thus brave winter’s rude estate?
                                Oh love, more helpless, why bloom so late,
                                Now that the flower?time of the year is done?
                                Since thy dear course must end when scarce begun,
                                Nipped by the cold touch of relentless fate.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            THE PASSING YEAR.
                            
                                NO breath of wind stirs in the painted
                                    leaves,
                                The meadows are as stirless as the sky,
                                Like a Saint’s halo golden vapours lie
                                Above the restful valley’s garnered sheaves.
                                The journeying Sun, like one who fondly grieves,
                                Above the hills seems loitering with a sigh,
                                As loth to bid the fruitful earth good?bye,
                                On these hushed hours of luminous autumn eves.
                            
                            
                                There is a pathos in his softening glow,
                                Which like a benediction seems to hover
                                O’er the tranced earth, ere he must sink below
                                And leave her widowed of her radiant Lover,
                                A frost?bound sleeper in a shroud of snow,
                                While winter winds howl a wild dirge above her.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            CHRISTMAS EVE.
                            
                                ALONE—with one fair star for company,
                                The loveliest star among the hosts of night,
                                While the grey tide ebbs with the ebbing light—
                                I pace along the darkening wintry sea.
                                Now round the yule?log and the glittering tree
                                Twinkling with festive tapers, eyes as bright
                                Sparkle with Christmas joys and young delight,
                                As each one gathers to his family.
                            
                            
                                But I—a waif on earth where’er I roam—
                                Uprooted with life’s bleeding hopes and fears
                                From that one heart that was my heart’s sole home,
                                Feel the old pang pierce through the severing years,
                                And as I think upon the years to come
                                That fair star trembles through my falling tears.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            THE EVENING OF THE YEAR.
                            
                                WAN mists enwrap the still?born day;
                                The harebell withers on the heath;
                                And all the moorland seems to breathe
                                The hectic beauty of decay.
                                Within the open grave of May
                                Dishevelled trees drop wreath on wreath;
                                Wind?wrung and ravelled underneath
                                Waste leaves choke up the woodland way.
                            
                            
                                The grief of many partings near
                                Wails like an echo in the wind:
                                The days of love lie far behind,
                                The days of loss lie shuddering near.
                                Life’s morning?glory who shall bind?
                                It is the evening of the year.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            NEW YEAR’S EVE.
                            
                                ANOTHER full?orbed year hath waned to?day,
                                And set in the irrevocable past,
                                And headlong whirled long Time’s winged blast
                                My fluttering rose of youth is borne away:
                                Ah rose once crimson with the blood of May,
                                A honeyed haunt where bees would break their fast,
                                I watch thy scattering petals flee aghast,
                                And all the flickering rose?lights turning grey.
                            
                            
                                Poor fool of life! plagued ever with thy vain
                                Regrets and futile longings! were the years
                                Not cups o’erbrimming still with gall and tears?
                                Let go thy puny personal joy and pain!
                                If youth with all its brief hope disappears,
                                To deathless hope we must be born again.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            NIRVANA.
                            
                                DIVEST thyself, O Soul, of vain desire!
                                Bid hope farewell, dismiss all coward fears;
                                Take leave of empty laughter, emptier tears,
                                And quench, for ever quench, the wasting fire
                                Wherein this heart, as in a funeral pyre,
                                Aye burns, yet is consumed not. Years on years
                                Moaning with memories in thy maddened ears—
                                Let at thy word, like refluent waves, retire.
                            
                            
                                Enter thy soul’s vast realm as Sovereign Lord,
                                And, like that angel with the flaming sword,
                                Wave off life’s clinging hands. Then chains will
                                    fall
                                From the poor slave of self’s hard tyranny—
                                And Thou, a ripple rounded by the sea,
                                In rapture lost be lapped within the All.
