				<p>
					<hi rend="b">T</hi>HE DEAN of Westminster Abbey (H. H. Milman), in 1841, wrote a letter to
					Daniel Webster, secretary of state under Mr. Tyler, in which he said: <q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"I wish it were in my power to visit America. There are three natural objects which I
							am extremely anxious to see--Niagara, a primeval forest, and one of your vast
							rivers."</p>
					</q></p>
				<p>At this time Mr. Webster was engaged in a prolonged and finally successful effort to
					determine the northeastern boundary line between Canada and the United States. The
					conclusion of the negotiations which brought the St. Lawrence and the St. Johns rivers
					into frequent mention were regarded on the one hand as Webster's principal achievement,
					and on the other as a base betrayal, not unaccompanied with vulgar graft, of the interests
					of the United States.</p>
				<p>Whether Dean Milman had in mind the St. Johns or the St. Lawrence, may not be known. But
					another river on the other side of the continent, a river draining 260,000 square miles of
					territory and affording, with its tributaries, a thousand miles of navigable water, at
					that time was regarded with covetous eyes by Englishmen amd Americans. The treaty that
					closed the war of 1812 had left room for controversy as to the rightful owners of the
					banks of the great waters east and west that were known to be close to the border line. As
					time went by and the advance couriers began to make report of the resources and
					possibilities of the disputed territory, the two nations saw that continental waterways,
					interminable stretches of fertile plain, hills suggestive of mineral wealth, and forests
					of prodigious value, were at stake. As in other ages and other lands, the banks of the
					waterways became the fighting ground of the contending claimants.</p>
				<p>It was three centuries after Columbus first saw the islands of the New World before the
					Columbia river was discovered. It had been named before it had been found, like an unborn
					babe, but afterwards the name was changed, as also sometimes happens in domestic affairs.
					Many of the early explorers of the Pacific coast had reported swift flowing shore waters
					that led them to surmise that a great river was pouring its flood into the sea. The
					Spaniards in their search for a northwest passage had many times passed by the mouth of
					the stream without apparently making closer observations than to note impressions of off
					shore currents. Captain James Cook, in 1778, sighted the northwest coast at 44 degrees of
					latitude, but sailed by the big river without suspecting its presence. Captain Mears,
					another Englishman, had visited the region and sought for the stream, and reported that it
					was a "myth." He saw the estuary into which the Columbia river flows, and called it
					"Deception Bay." Vancouver <pb id="VAB9260-002" n="2"/> had visited the coast, but he
					could not find the fabled stream of fresh water. While Vancouver was cruising about in
					these waters, Robert Gray, a Boston sea captain, discovered the long sought river and gave
					to the United States what the Britannica calls "the best claim to all the territory
					drained by it." Gray named the river "Columbia," after the name of his ship. This name has
					endured, though the river, while still undiscovered, or at least not located, had first
					been named the Oregon, by Jonathan Carver, an American living in London, who, in his
					"Travels," voiced common report that there was a Great River of the West. The name is of
					doubtful origin, and was probably not a second time used in print until 1817, when in
					"Thanatopsis," William Cullen Bryant wrote: <q rend="blockquote">
						<lg>
							<l>
								<hi rend="right">--Take the wings</hi></l>
							<l>Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness.</l>
							<l>Or lose thyself in the continuous woods</l>
							<l>Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound</l>
							<l>Save his own dashings--yet the dead are there.</l>
						</lg>
					</q>
				</p>
				<p>Though the name which Carver gave to the river of the west did not cling to it, the
					territory which the river drains became known as Oregon, and in history so remains. It is
					of this region lying north of 42 degrees of latitude (the northern boundary of
					California), and west of the Rocky Mountain watershed, a territory out of which Great
					Britain organized the southern part of British Columbia, and our own country created the
					states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and parts of Montana (28,000 square miles), and
					Wyoming (13,000 square miles), that this paper has to do.</p>
				<p>A recent article in the North American Review by Lucy M. Salmon, raises the question,
					"Why Is History Rewritten?" and demonstrates that newly discovered materials and improved
					facilities for study and comparison give the answer. Certainly there has been a flood of
					information on the so called Oregon question. The papers of Andrew Jackson have recently
					been acquired by the Library of Congress. The diary of John Quincy Adams remained in
					manuscript for many years after his death. The publication of Polk's Diary, of the
					documents brought to light by the Oregon Historical Society and the coterie of scholarly
					men in the universities of the new states of the northwest and of Texas, adds
					substantially to the historical data of the period of our greatest territorial
					acquisition. I can merely suggest the great body of literature available for a discussion
					of these years in which the American people were so highly moved and were carried so
					swiftly and inevitably to a great crisis.</p>


				<div2 type="section">
					<head rend="center">THE EARLY PACIFIC COAST EXPLORATIONS.</head>

					<p>We have to do with the question of title to a great territory and the manner in which
						ownership was asserted and acquired. The beginnings go far enough back to reach into the
						period when Spain was a supreme power. She declared primary ownership to all America by
						reason of the discoveries made by Columbus. This claim was confirmed to her, at least in
						the minds of those who subordinated temporal to spiritual authority, by the Bull of Pope
						Alexander V, who in 1493 granted to Spain all rights of trade and conquest not before
						conferred on Christian people. In the following year Spain and Portugal signed the
						"Treaty of the Partition of the Ocean," under which North <pb id="VAB9260-003" n="3"/>
						America fell to Spain. Of course all of this would come to naught if there were no
						assertion of authority by Spain and no occupancy of the land parceled to her.</p>
					<p>Periodically through Cortez, Cabrillo, Perez and Vizciana, Spanish expeditions on the
						western coast of North America were made, followed with settlements, particularly in
						California. In one of these exploring expeditions the mariners encountered an enemy in
						the northwest wind, which, as one pious historian recorded, "was raised up by the foe of
						the human race in order to prevent the advance of ships and to delay the discovery of
						those countries and the conversion of their inhabitants to the Catholic faith." Despite
						obstinate winds, however, the Spanish explorations continued. In 1775, Heceta, in
						latitude 46 degrees and 17 minutes, came opposite an opening in the coast line, whence
						rushed too strong a current to allow his entering, though he remained a second day to
						try it. This was the terrible bar of the "Great River of the West."</p>
					<p>Spain claimed to the sixtieth parallel by reason of the explorations of her navigators.
						Her title was at least good to 54 degrees and 40 minutes--a limitation destined to
						figure in history. This claim was established by Perez, who, even British authorities
						admit, made the first real and undisputed exploration of the Oregon coast of which there
						is any record.</p>
					<p>And how did Great Britain acquire rights in Oregon? Her claim likewise dates back to
						early times. By the treaty of Utrecht, early in the eighteenth century, a treaty that
						was a sort of clearing house, by which European powers, almost exhausted by their long
						wars, parceled out territories in several continents, the 49th parallel was made the
						southern boundary of British (Canadian) possessions in North America. Where this
						parallel might lead was unknown, for its western extension was lost in the prairies and
						in the unexplored fastnesses of the Rocky Mountains. But Great Britain did not depend
						upon this treaty to sustain her claims. Drake, in 1579, went into harbor at 38 degrees,
						30 minutes, near the latitude of San Francisco, and took possession of this "New Alba,"
						in the name of Queen Elizabeth. This exploration, original as to Drake, was yet not
						valid as against Spanish claims, and was consequently abandoned. Captain James Cook, in
						several voyages, touched on the Pacific coast, but probably saw nothing that the
						Spaniards had not previously seen and claimed. Vancouver, though he had missed the
						Columbia, explored the Fucan Straits and made settlements on the island that bears his
						name--an island twice the area of Massachusetts, that the Spaniards had discovered and
						explored. Alexander MacKenzie had gone westward overland in 1793, and explored to the
						Pacific coast at 52 degrees, 20 minutes. And so too there were Frazer and others, but
						British claims depending on priority of discovery from the sea side were not convincing.
						British policy was to hold all that she explored and to wrest from less tenacious
						discoverers all that they were unable or unwilling to defend. The Hudson's Bay Company,
						whose unlimited charter gave it governmental authority, dominated this northwest
						country. Its trappers and hunters found rich prizes in fur and added the incentive of
						profit to the Briton's natural zeal for colonial expansion. And so when we come down.
							<pb id="VAB9260-004" n="4"/> to the year in which the mother country and her children
						were determining the rightful ownership of this territory, we find the Hudson's Bay
						Company's men in force down to about 46 degrees of latitude in the valley of the
						Columbia.</p>
					<p>Besides Spain and Great Britain, Russia was a claimant. Her mariners not only visited
						frequently the upper Pacific coasts and all of Alaska, where Russian trading posts had
						been established, but they sailed southward as far as California. Englishmen had
						explored the interior, following the rivers to the "frozen sea," but there was little
						disposition to assert a claim counter to Russia's along the Bering sea and the Gulf of
						Alaska.</p>
					<p>As the controversy over ownership was finally narrowed down to the United States and
						Great Britain (the real owners, the Indians, of course, we complacently ignore in
						accordance with civilized practice), we must consider for a moment how Spain and Russia
						were eliminated and how our own country became involved. The United States became a
						factor by discovery when Gray found the Columbia. She added the strength, which comes
						through exploration, by an official expedition, led by Lewis and Clark at the instance
						of President Jefferson. This was the historical transcontinental trip to the Pacific in
						which the Columbia river and its sources were discovered from the land side and partly
						explored (1804-1806). A few years later (1811) John Jacob Astor's fur company built
						Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia and established commercial relations with this
						region as an American enterprise.</p>
					<p>But in addition to rights acquired on her own initiative, the United States became the
						possessor of the title that Spain held to the north Pacific coast and to all that Russia
						claimed south of 54 degrees, 40 minutes. The United States in 1819 purchased Florida
						from Spain and settled by treaty many vexed questions. The Florida of the treaty was not
						the Florida of today, but vast and irregular areas on both the Atlantic and Pacific
						oceans, including all of Spanish "rights, claims and pretensions of any territory," east
						of the line of the Sabine river and north of 42 degrees. This was not Louisiana, for
						that had passed from Spain to France and from France to the United States in 1803; but
						it did mean and include all of the Columbia river region. In return we released any
						claim that we might have west of the line named. This, it afterwards appeared, included
						parts of Texas, which we might have held under the Louisiana cession.</p>
					<p>Spain thus conferred title on the United States to all that she had on the Pacific,
						north of California. But she had previously clouded her own title to exclusive
						possession by the Nootka Sound treaty with Great Britain. By the terms of this
						convention, she acknowledged that British subjects had equal rights with her own to
						trade or make settlements in places not already occupied--that is, anywhere north of
						California. She did not yield title, but she created a condition under which Great
						Britain might, and did make, settlements in what was otherwise Spanish possessions. It
						was under the terms of that treaty, rather than by discoveries of her own, that Britain
						established herself in and about Vancouver and the Fucan Straits, all of which had
						previously been visited by the Spanish, the Russians and by Americans--notably by
						Captain Kendrick, of Boston, who preceded <pb id="VAB9260-005" n="5"/> Vancouver by at
						least two years, dealt widely in peltries, but made no settlements.</p>
					<p>And the United States also acquired important rights from Russia, whose claims along
						the coast overlapped Spain's and our own. By treaty, in 1824, Russia agreed to make no
						settlement south of 54 degrees 40 minutes, and virtually surrendered all claims as
						against the United States, south of that line, while the United States agreed to make no
						settlement north of 54 degrees 40 minutes.</p>
					<p>Here this historic line assumes its permanent place in history, and Russia disappears
						as a claimant to Oregon. This was the latitude, it will be remembered, reached by the
						Spaniard, Perez, in his exploring expedition of 1774.</p>
					<p>At the time of the Russian convention with the United States, Great Britain and Russia
						negotiated a separate treaty fixing Great Britain's territory to the north. The United
						States, of course, was not bound by this treaty, nor did Great Britain make any
						concessions to the United States respecting territory south of 54 degrees 40
						minutes.</p>
					<p>When the United States and Great Britain established the boundary on the 49th parallel
						from the Lake-of-the-Woods to the Rocky Mountains, in 1818, there was disagreement as to
						the extension of the line west of the mountains. It was finally arranged that for a
						period of ten years there should be joint occupancy of Oregon, that it should be open to
						settlement to citizens of both countries and that title should be held in abeyance. This
						agreement was afterwards extended with a proviso that it might be terminated by either
						party on one year's notice. The notice was finally given by the United States in the
						very year and only a few weeks in advance of the determination of the boundary
						controversy, to the consideration of which we now pass.</p>
				</div2>

				<div2 type="section">
					<head rend="center">NATIONAL POLITICAL CONDITIONS.</head>

					<p>Perhaps no period of American history produced more eminent public men than the years
						immediately preceding and following the Mexican War, which included the period of
						critical negotiations with our neighbors in relation to the settlement of international
						boundary lines. Some of these men were statesmen; many of them were politicians, but
						they were dealing with large politics. Their problems were handled with a skill and
						eloquence in debate rarely surpassed even among a people given to agitation and oratory.
						Some of the questions were international; and some were of purely American origin--the
						national bank and other questions of finance, the American Indians and their lands, the
						tariff, the sovereignty of the states and of the Union, nullification and secession,
						canals, railroads and other national highways, the telegraph, war claims, international
						boundaries, immigration, the conquest of the gloomy forests, the movements of large
						bodies of pioneers to rich and almost unknown new lands, and the swelling and sometimes
						roaring voice of a rising people. And over and through it all, modifying the attitude of
						men on all other questions, inflaming the sections and threatening and foreboding
						disaster so vast that all disorders of modern times sink into insignificance in
						comparison, was the question of slavery.</p>
					<p>Few problems were determined alone on their merits. Interests were diverse. In the
						southern states a sacred institution was intrenched <pb id="VAB9260-006" n="6"/> and
						reaching out black hands for prey. With them but not always of them were great
						names--Jackson, Benton, Calhoun, Davis, Polk, Clay. And over against them, though not
						always in opposite parties, were Webster, Adams, Van Buren and that group of
						abolitionists who, with fanatical zeal, slashed the nation's sores with such persistence
						that there could be no rest.</p>
					<p>In such an age and with such environment the Oregon boundary question came before the
						people for final determination. In calmer mood and with fewer distractions it might have
						been handled differently. Lower British Columbia might now have been a part of the
						United States; or, on the other hand, it might have been that a third war with Great
						Britain would have delivered a part of Canada into American hands and the whole Pacific
						coast might now be flying the British flag. There is room for endless speculation, and
						perhaps it is all fruitless; but at any rate it may be allowed that sometimes
						circumstances alter the course of history.</p>
					<p>There were two great annexation problems and behind each was a different motive and a
						different historical setting. Of the processes by which we came into possession of the
						Texas and other Mexican territory, and of the Mexican War, we are here incidentally
						concerned as these had an important bearing on the question that was contemporaneous
						relating to the annexation of the territory on the northwest border. Our opponent in the
						Mexican controversies was a Spanish people already decadent. In the Oregon controversy
						we had to deal with the British nation then at the hight of its maritime power and
						reaching into all parts of the known world for territory and commercial supremacy. If
						Mexico or Columbia had owned Oregon would the United States have taken what she wanted
						and paid for it as we paid for Texas or Panama? This perhaps is a futile and impertinent
						question better for reflection than for discussion.</p>
					<p>The Democratic platform adopted at the Baltimore National Convention in 1844, contained
						the following plank: <q rend="blockquote"> "Resolved, That our title to the whole of the
							territory of Oregon is clear and unquestionable; that no portion of the same ought to
							be ceded to England or any other power, and that the reoccupation of Oregon and the
							reannexation of Texas at the earliest practicable period, are great American measures
							which this convention recommends to the cordial support of the Democracy of the
							Union."</q></p>
					<p>Van Buren was the choice of an instructed majority of the delegates. He would have been
						nominated almost without opposition if he had agreed to the proposed annexation of
						Texas. But in a letter published a short time before the convention met, he objected to
						this program. This letter took away the enthusiasm of a large part of his following that
						was still nominally attached to him. He received a majority vote in the convention, but
						was defeated by the two-thirds rule. James Knox Polk, was brought forward as a dark
						horse--the first known to our presidential convention system, and was nominated.</p>
					<p>In the Whig party there was an equally interesting situation. Henry Clay was the idol
						of his party. He was a southern man and a slaveholder, and yet much of his strength must
						come from the north. The throngs that came to hear and see him north and south remind
							<pb id="VAB9260-007" n="7"/> one in later days of the multitudes that have followed
						other presidential candidates who have seemed to have the whole country at their heels
						but have nevertheless been immune from election.</p>
					<p>It was evident that whatever Clay might say on the annexation of Texas, which was
						advocated by the south in order that the slave area might be increased, could not please
						all of his immense following north and south. When informed that the annexation treaty
						had been offered to Texas and that the United States senate was willing to ratify it,
						Clay wrote what has come to be known as his Raleigh letter. His conclusions were that we
						once owned Texas and parted with it, and to talk of "resuming" title was perfectly idle
						and ridiculous if not dishonorable, and that annexation and war with Mexico were
						identical.</p>
					<p>As Van Buren's hostility to the annexation of Texas had cost him the Democratic
						nomination, so Clay's letter cost him the presidency. The south discarded both of these
						leaders; demanded the annexation of Texas or the dissolution of the Union, and there was
						talk to the effect that if it became necessary, the southern states would form a
						confederacy of their own and annex Texas. The evil day was postponed inasmuch as Polk
						was elected. Frauds in the election in New York, Pennsylvania and the southern states
						were alleged by the Whigs--frauds of sufficient magnitude to change the result in Polk's
						favor. By whatever decree of politics, fate or providence, there now came to the
						presidential chair a comparatively unknown man destined to play a large part in the
						world's history, to modify the domain of nations and to bring under the flag of the
						United States, territory north, south and west, out of which nine states were
						created.</p>
				</div2>

				<div2 type="section">
					<head rend="center">TEXAS AND OREGON.</head>

					<p>After Polk's election, but before he took office, Tyler, in the last months of his
						presidential career, was pressing for the annexation of Texas more ardently than for the
						settlement of the Oregon question. Calhoun, his secretary of state, declared that the
						time had not yet come to maintain our claim to the exclusive right in Oregon against the
						adverse claim of Great Britain. She could concentrate her naval forces at the mouth of
						the Columbia, while our fleet would have to sail around Cape Horn and our troops cross
						3,000 miles of naked plains and mountains. How then, he asked, can we save Oregon? There
						is but one means--time. All we need to gain our aim is a masterly inactivity. In the
						campaign just closed, Oregon and Texas had been linked together but Tyler was not
						interested in Oregon, though he was profoundly concerned over Texas. Calhoun gave Texas
						a written promise of protection and concentrated forces upon her border. Jackson lent
						his weighty support and declared that "the present golden moment to obtain Texas must
						not be lost, or Texas must, from necessity, be thrown into the arms of England."</p>
					<p>Nothing in Jackson's papers has been found showing that he was interested in Oregon
						except that he said in one letter that "there is no chance of our country and England
						getting together over Oregon," and in another (to Senator Blair), probably the last
						letter he ever wrote, he predicted that "we will have no war with England." Calhoun
						interrogated the British minister as to Great Britain's policy toward Texas. The answer
						was, that while the United States and the <pb id="VAB9260-008" n="8"/> whole world knew
						that Great Britain was constantly striving to bring about the abolition of slavery
						wherever it existed, she would not unduly meddle with either Mexico or Texas. Her
						objects were purely commercial and she had no intention to act directly or indirectly in
						a political sense on the United States through Texas. To this Calhoun replied that the
						President read with deep concern the avowal, then made for the first time, that Great
						Britain desired and was constantly exerting herself to procure the abolition of slavery
						throughout the world and that she wished to see it abolished in Texas. He ended by
						informing Mr. Pakenham that a treaty had been concluded for the annexation of Texas to
						the United States as the most effectual means of guarding against the threatened danger
						and securing permanent peace and welfare in the United States.</p>
					<p>The British press commented upon the moderate tone in which Tyler spoke of Oregon, and
						the determined manner in which he spoke of Texas. The Morning Post blurted out its
						disgust and declared that while it might be desirable to have commercial dealings with
						the United States, all other relations were objectionable, and called the government a
						nuisance on the highway of the world.</p>
					<p>President Tyler in his last hours had signed a joint resolution of annexation, good
						upon its acceptance by Texas, which was still at war with Mexico, but upon Polk fell the
						consequences, which he was willing to assume. In his inaugural address he declared that
						the question of annexation did not concern foreign nations and belonged exclusively to
						Texas and the United States. As to Oregon, it was his duty to assert and maintain our
						right. Our title to the Oregon country, the President declared in the language of the
						convention that nominated him, was clear and unquestionable.</p>
					<p>This again aroused the war fever in England. She was at peace with the world and there
						was no better time for resenting the bullying style of the American people. This was her
						attitude, but it had no deterring effect on the people of this country. In conventions
						and newspapers they were demanding that the government should claim Oregon as far north
						as 54 degrees 40 minutes, let the consequences be what they might. The very resistance
						which our demands met abroad, increased the intensity with which they were repeated at
						home--not by all people, of course, but by the large element that had committed itself
						to this view.</p>
					<p>The abolitionists contended that there never was any real danger of war with Great
						Britain. They declared that behind all the American bluster so far as the administration
						was concerned, there was no intent to provoke hostilities. George W. Julian, in his life
						of Joshua R. Giddings, lays bare the abolition attitude of that strenuous period. "There
						was a widespread feeling of alarm," he says. "Our title to the whole of Oregon was, to
						say the least, exceedingly debatable, but was quite as clear and unquestionable as our
						title to the whole of Texas, for the assertion of which the government was about to
						plunge the nation into war with Mexico. England and the United States had each taken a
						definite and positive position and there seemed to be no reason to suppose that either
						would yield. The President had the united support of his party, which seemed to be eager
						for the great conflict; and yet the administration made no adequate preparations <pb
							id="VAB9260-009" n="9"/> for the struggle. In the opinion of those who had most
						carefully studied the designs of the slavocracy, he was playing a cowardly game of
						diplomacy."</p>
					<p>Giddings, late in the controversy, when the drift of negotiations was apparent, said to
						the House of Representatives (in June, 1846). "It is the annexation of Texas that has
						rendered the whole of Oregon necessary to restore the balance of power. By the
						annexation of Texas the slave states now have a majority in the Senate. They will
						continue to retain that majority unless we add territory to our northwestern border.</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"But southern gentlemen whose voices at the last session were heard loud and long in
							favor of Texas and the whole of Oregon, now see a lion in the way. They were then
							chivalrous; now they are for peace. * * * Last year they spoke in strains of fervent
							oracles of the glory of extending American sway and of adding new states to our
							brilliant constellation; now they call upon their northern friends to stop this mad
							career of extending the power of our government and to leave the political control of
							the nation in their hands for a few years until Great Britain shall quietly give up
							her claims to that territory.They have suddenly called to mind the declaration of
							British statesmen that a war with the United States would be a war of emancipation.
							They see in prospect the black regiments of the British West India Islands landing
							amongst them and their slaves flocking to the enemy's standard. Servile insurrections
							torment their imaginations. Rapine, blood and murder dance before their affrighted
							vision. They are now seen in every part of the hall calling on Whigs and Democrats to
							save them from the dreadful consequences of their own policy. Well, sir, I reply to
							them, 'This is your policy, not ours; you have forced us into it against our will and
							our utmost opposition; you have prepared the poisoned chalice and we will press it to
							your lips until you swallow the dregs.' * * * It is most obvious to my judgment that
							the President can not be driven into war with England. A war with that nation must
							prove a total overthrow of slavery. Every reflecting statesman must see this as
							clearly as any event can be foretold by human perception. I do not think that the
							slave-holding portion of the Democratic party were aware that the carrying out of
							their Baltimore resolution would sacrifice slavery. They rather believed that by
							obtaining Texas the price of human flesh would be enhanced and slavery supported. The
							consequences of seizing the 'whole of Oregon' were not considered. Mr. Polk in his
							inaugural address and in his annual message evidently overlooked the momentous effect
							which his twice declared policy would produce on the slave interest to which he is
							indissolubly wedded. He and his cabinet and his party have made a fatal blunder. They
							will soon discover their error and will recede from their position. With the same
							degree of confidence as I have in my own existence I declare that they will before the
							nation and the world recede from their fool policy <pb id="VAB9260-010" n="10"/> and
							will surrender up all that portion of Oregon north of the 49th parallel of latitude
							and let the subject remain as it now is. I wish to place this prediction on record for
							future reference."</p></q>
					<p>Mr. Adams spoke in similar vein and the speeches no doubt had an influence in composing
						a threatened situation, for they were taken as notice by Great Britain that an element
						of the American people regarded the war talk as campaign thunder only, with no support
						in fact from the administration which had found itself placed in this position; that it
						could not consistently demand the annexation of Texas and the Mexican possessions
						extending to the Pacific, which they wished as much as a support for slavery as for
						territorial purposes, without putting into their platform a demand for Oregon, for which
						we had a better claim than we had to Texas and the Mexican possessions.</p>
					<p>While the controversy waged in Congress, in the House of Commons and in the newspapers,
						a stream of immigrants poured across the plains. Many luminous recitals remain of this
						remarkable migration over the prairies, across the mountains, through the South pass and
						over into the Pacific region, along trails that were marked with the debris of caravans.
						Here is a typical picture painted at Independence two or three months after Polk's
						inaugural.</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"We see a long train of wagons coming through our streets. As they go they are hailed
							with joyous shouts of welcome by their fellow travelers. Looking out at a passing
							train we see among the foremost a comfortable covered wagon with its sheets so drawn
							aside as to reveal a quiet looking woman seated inside and sewing. The bottom of the
							wagon is carpeted; nearby are three chairs, and hanging along the sides are articles
							of ornament and use. Then comes team after team, each drawn by six or eight stout
							oxen, driven by stout sons of Anak, not one of them under six feet two in stockings.
							We are in a perfect Oregon fever. Then comes stock of every description, negroes,
							horses, mules, cows, oxen, and there seems to be no end of them. Not less than two or
							three thousand people are gathered at this point. A train of two hundred wagons left
							our town on Tuesday bound for Oregon. Yesterday twenty-eight passed. Two hundred more
							crossed the Missouri at St. Joseph and fifty are crossing at the lower ferry. May 4,
							four companies set out for Independence. One who met the great body of immigrants
							after they had set out on their long journey, declared that the trail was crowded with
							immigrants and that he passed five hundred wagons, of between six and seven thousand
							immigrants, and some ten thousand cattle."</p></q>
					<p>While the immigrants were thus settling the Oregon question by settling Oregon, or at
						least the Columbia river and Willamette valleys, official negotiations were repeatedly
						undertaken and abandoned between Great Britain and the United States. Buchanan, who had
						become Polk's secretary of state, suggested the 49th degree with the freedom to Great
						Britain of such ports in Vancouver island, south of the line, as she might desire. <pb
							id="VAB9260-011" n="11"/> President Polk said that our title was good to 54 degrees 40
						minutes and nothing could have induced him to yield any part of the territory had he not
						found himself embarrassed, if not committed, he said, by the acts of his predecessors.
						These, Secretary Buchanan related to Pakenham, had always acted on the principle of
						compromise and the President therefore had determined to do the same. War rather than
						dishonor was deeply graven upon the hearts of the American people, but the President was
						sure that there could be no dishonor in following a course pursued by many Presidents
						since the days of Monroe. The President did not think that the civilized world would
						justify "a war waged for comparatively worthless territory north of 49, which his
						predecessors had over and over again offered to surrender."</p>
					<p>Pakenham flatly refused this offer without referring it to his government. This brought
						Polk back to a belligerent attitude and he directed Buchanan to withdraw the offer.
						Buchanan objected, saying that it was not the part of wise statesmanship in the existing
						state or our relations with Mexico.</p>
					<p>Whatever defects Polk might have had, he was not timid and he replied to his secretary,
						"that he saw no reason for delaying action with Great Britain because of our relations
						with Mexico." In a quarrel with his secretary (see Polk's Diary), referring to the
						pending political campaign, Polk suggested to Buchanan that it was not 54-40 nor 49 that
						was causing the trouble, but it was the pending campaign of '48.</p>
					<p>Receiving intimations that the British government had regretted the summary action of
						Pakenham in rejecting the American offer, Buchanan asked for permission to say to
						Pakenham that he would receive a reasonable proposition from Great Britain. The
						President emphatically declined and declared that he should reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine
						against allowing any European power to plant any colony upon the American continent. He
						forbade Buchanan to deliver a conciliatory note to Pakenham and wrote one himself, so
						tart in its intimations that Pakenham withdrew all overtures. The two powers thus once
						more stood apart while the long wagon trains made their way westward.</p>

					<head rend="center">LAST STAGES OF THE OREGON QUESTION.</head>

					<p>Polk's annual message on the Oregon question bristled in wrath. He went over the
						history of the controversy, including his own offer and withdrawal of the 49th degree
						and asked Congress to authorize the year's notice provided for in the convention to end
						the joint occupancy of Oregon. He wanted authority to establish forts, and extend
						protection of our laws over Oregon. At the end of the year's notice our rights in Oregon
						must be yielded or firmly established. That they could not be yielded without a
						sacrifice of national honor was too clear to be doubted. To give to Great Britain
						two-thirds of Oregon as demanded, the free navigation of the Columbia and all the
						valuable ports on the Pacific, would be to abandon our rights and our national honor.
						Our rising greatness as a nation had attracted the attention of the powers of Europe and
						some of them had proposed a balance of power on this continent to check our advance.
						European interference could not be allowed and he proposed, "that it should be
						distinctly announced to the world as our settled policy that no future European colony
						or dominion <pb id="VAB9260-012" n="12"/> shall, with our consent, be planted or
						established in any part of the North American continent."</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>These words of the President set the country ringing with applause. If war must come,
							let it come.</p></q>
					<p>Pakenham then came forward with a proposition to abritrate. This was rejected and in
						the following, spring (1846) Congress authorized the President to give the year's notice
						of the termination of joint occupancy. He did so at once and Pakenham acting on
						instruction presently made an offer of compromise at the 49th parallel, Great Britain
						reserving Vancouver island and the free navigation of the Columbia.</p>
					<p>The troubled political waters calmed at once. Benton relates that he advised the
						President to receive Great Britain's offer as it was practically the same that we had
						repeatedly made ourselves. Polk, from threatening slaughter, played wise politics. He
						said he would submit the offer to the Senate for its advice, and that if Benton could
						secure the assurances of the leaders of both parties that the offer was acceptable and
						would recommend its adoption he would present it for action. Without these assurances,
						however, he would reject it without qualification. Benton contended that 54 degrees
						forty minutes was the northern limit proposed by Monroe for Britain's boundary, not
						ours, and that New Caledonia, or the Frazer River valley, had been repeatedly conceded
						to Britain. How then could we now hold out for it?</p>
					<p>Controlling politicians of the Democratic Party probably had little expectation that
						this country would acquire territory as far north as was demanded in the battle cry of
						the campaign, but while they were promoting the scheme for the absorption of Texas they
						were keeping the Oregon question well to the front as a cover for such advantage as
						might be derived from it. William Henry Smith in his political history of slavery,
						speaking largely from personal recollection, relates that "after the elections of '44
						the senators who had employed the party cry 54-40 or Fight, during the special canvass,
						found themselves embarrassed by the readiness with which the administration abandoned
						that position." Benton insisted that it was impossible to acquire title to 54-40. His
						followers apologized for abandoning the position assumed in the campaign and did what
						they could to minimize the claim which had been put out.</p>
					<p>When it appeared that Giddings's prophecy was about to come true and that the 49th
						parallel was likely to be accepted as the dividing line between British Columbia and the
						United States, without a final struggle for a more northern latitude, there was not only
						alarm in the northwest from immigrants, but some northern Democrats who had accepted
						literally the party platform and Polk's acquiescence in the "54-40 or fight" demand
						refused to be reconciled. Among these Democrats was Senator Hannegan, of Indiana, who
						was one of the most vociferous in the howling political wilderness of his day and the
						forerunner of a later school not unknown in the state he represented.</p>
					<p>Edward A. Hannegan was born in Ohio, admitted to the bar in Kentucky, held office from
						Indiana and died in Missouri (in 1859). He was elected United States Senator by a fluke
						in 1843 and served one term. Always an extremist, it is not surprising that he took
						radical <pb id="VAB9260-013" n="13"/> grounds in the Oregon question. He sent a toast to
						a committee that had invited him to a dinner in honor of Mr. Dallas in Philadelphia in
						1846 as follows:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"Oregon--Every foot or not an inch; 54 degrees, 40 minutes or delenda est
							Brittania."</p></q>
					<p>The toast committee replied to him:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"The Hon. Edward A. Hannegan: The true hearted American statesman, who truly
							represents the people on the Oregon question--the whole of it or none; Oregon or
							war!"</p></q>
					<p>The sinister rumor that the President was inclined to encourage the British government
						to propose a settlement on the basis of the 49th parallel was disturbing the friends of
						the administration to such a degree that it was deemed advisable to prepare the public
						for what might develop. Senator Haywood, of North Carolina, a personal and political
						friend of the President, and speaking advisedly, undertook to show not so much that the
						line of 49 degrees was right in itself, but that the President was not so far committed
						against it as that he could not form a treaty upon it. It ought to be borne in mind, he
						held, that Great Britain had occupied the Oregon territory for forty years and it was
						absurd to suppose that if we turned suddenly upon her and told her she must quit, she
						would not make resistance. He referred to the division which had sprung up in the
						Democratic party the tendency of which was to destroy the party by cutting off its
						heads. This question of Oregon had been turned into a party question for the purpose of
						President making. The creed of the Baltimore convention directs the party to reannex
						Texas and to reoccupy Oregon. Texas has been reannexed and now we are to go for the
						reoccupation of Oregon. Now old Oregon, embracing all the territory on which American
						foot ever trod, comprises merely the valley of the Willamette, which does not extend
						above 49 degrees, and consequently this portion was all which could be contemplated in
						the expression "reoccupation," as it would involve an absurdity to speak of reoccupying
						what we had never occupied.</p>
					<p>The extremists in the Democratic party suspecting that Mr. Haywood had been talking the
						sentiments that the President had confided to him, undertook to cross-question him
						through Mr. Hannegan, whose temperament and talents were supposed to be well adaptd to
						this form of polemics.</p>
					<p>Said Mr. Hannegan.</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"I desire through the Vice-President, to put a question to the Senator from North
							Carolina--a question which I have committed to writing. It is this: I ask him if he
							has the authority of the President, directly or indirectly, for saying that it is his,
							the President's, wish to terminate the Oregon question by compromising with Great
							Britain on the 49th degree of north latitude."</p></q>
					<p>A point of order was made and Mr. Haywood parried, whereupon Mr. Hannegan resumed:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"I do not deem it material whether the Senator from North Carolina gives a direct
							answer to my question or not. It is entirely immaterial. He assumes--no, he says there
							is <pb id="VAB9260-014" n="14"/>" no assumption about it--that there is no meaning in
							language, no truth in man, if the President anywhere commits himself to 54-40, as his
							flattering friends assume for him. Now, sir, there is no truth in man; there is no
							meaning in language if the President is not committed to 54-40 in as strong language
							as that which makes up the Holy Book.</p>
						<p>From a period antecedent to that in which he became the nominee of the Baltimore
							convention down to this moment, to all the world he stands committed to 54-40. I go
							back to his declaration made in 1844 to a committee of citizens of Cincinnati, who
							addressed him in relation to the annexation of Texas, and he there uses this language,
							being then before the country as the Democratic candidate for the chair which he now
							fills."</p></q>
					<p>Mr. Hannegan then read from President Polk's annual message to show that in withdrawing
						the proposition which he had made to Great Britain for a compromise on the 49th parallel
						he had taken a position against ever resuming it. This paragraph is as follows:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"The extraordinary and wholly inadmissible demands of the British government and the
							rejection of the proposition made in deference alone to what had been done by my
							predecessors, and the implied obligation which their acts seem to impose, afford
							satisfactory evidence that no compromise which the United States ought to accept can
							be effected. With this conviction the proposition of compromise which had been made
							and rejected was by my direction subsequently withdrawn and our title to the whole
							Oregon territory asserted and, as I believe, maintained by irrefragable facts and
							arguments."</p>
						<p>"What does the President here claim?" demanded Mr. Hannegan. "Up to 54-40--every inch
							of it. He has asserted that claim and is, as he says, sustained by irrefragable facts
							and arguments. But this is not all. I hold that the language of the Secretary of State
							is the language of the President of the United States. And has not Mr. Buchanan in his
							last communication to Mr. Pakenham named 54-40 in so many words? He has. The President
							adopts his language as his own. He plants himself on 54-40.</p>
						<milestone unit="typography" n="* * * * * * * * * * *" rend="center"/>
						<p>Oregon and Texas were the watchwords of the party in the presidential election. Texas
							having been gained, Oregon, without treachery, can not be abandoned.</p></q>
					<p>"The Democratic party is thus bound to the whole of Oregon--every foot of it; and will
						the Senator rise in his place who will tell him in what quarter of this Union, in what
						assembly of Democrats of this Union, pending the presidential election, the names of
						Texas and Oregon did not fly together, side by side, on the Democratic banners.
						Everywhere they were twins; everywhere they were united. Does the senator from North
						Carolina suppose that he, with his appeals to the Democracy, can blind our eyes as he
						thinks he tickled our ears?</p>
					<pb id="VAB9260-015" n="15"/>
					<p>"Texas and Oregon can not be divided. They dwell together in the American heart. Even
						in Texas, I have been told, the flag of the Lone Star had inscribed on it the name of
						Oregon. Then it was all Oregon. Now, when you have got Texas, it means just so much of
						Oregon as you in your kindness and condescension think proper to give us. You little
						know us if you think the migthy west will be trodden on in this way."</p>
					<p>Undertaking to disclaim for the President, sentiments attributed to him by Mr. Haywood,
						Mr. Hannegan resumed:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"The Senator, in his defense of the President, put language into his mouth which I
							undertake to say the President will repudiate, and I am not the President's champion
							of power. I defend the right, and the right only. But for the President, I deny the
							intentions which, if they were entertained by him, would make him an infamous
							man--aye, an infamous man."</p></q>
					<p>In plain words he represents the President as paranthetically "sticking in" a few
						hollow and false words to cajole the ultraisms of the country:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"What is this but charging upon the President, conduct the most vile and infamous? If
							these allegations be true, these intentions of the President must sooner or later come
							to light; but when brought to light what must follow but irretrievable disgrace? As
							long as one human eye remains to linger on the page of history the story of his
							abasement will be read, sending him and his name together to an infamy so profound, a
							damnation so deep that the hand of resurrection will never be able to drag him
							forth."</p></q>
					<p>Upon being called to order for these resounding words he concluded by saying that "so
						far as the whole tone, spirit and meaning of the remarks of the Senator from North
						Carolina is concerned, if they speak the language of James K. Polk then James K. Polk
						has spoken words of falsehood with the tongue of a serpent."</p>
					<p>This was pretty stiff for one Democrat speaking of another, but with true Irish
						evanescence Hannegan soon forgot Polk's offense. Perhaps the fact that the President,
						who had been consigned to damnation so deep, nevertheless emerged and appointed Mr.
						Hannegan minister to Prussia, had something to do with it. But Mr. Hannegan was unfit
						for diplomacy as he was for ordinary domestic tranquillity and he was soon recalled from
						Berlin. William Wesley Woolen, in his historical sketches of early Indiana, quotes an
						English woman who was much impressed by Mr. Hannegan's eloquence, particularly by his
						speech on Oregon. She wrote a book of American impressions in which she says:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"When Mr. Hannegan made his speech on the Oregon question I was in the gallery
							immediately above and in the excitement of the moment I threw down my glove to the
							speaker. It fell at his side. The chivalric Hannegan picked it up, pressed it to his
							lips, looked gratefully up to the gallery and bowed and placed it in his bosom. The
							fortunate glove <pb id="VAB9260-016" n="16"/> was transmitted by the next day's post
							to the lady of the Senator then in Indiana. I preserved the less happy fellow to
							it."</p></q>
					<p>Mr. Hannegan's life was a tragedy. Volatile, generous and impulsive, he had all the
						faults that go with an uncontrolled nature. His eloquence he employed at times in the
						defense of the weak. For himself he took no thought. It will be remembered that in a
						drunken quarrel he slew his own brother-in-law, of whom, in his sober moments, he was
						very fond.</p>
					<p>But I have already wandered too far in following the career of this one of our own
						people who figured for a brief period on the national stage and was an actor in the
						Oregon drama. The Hannegan episode helped to prepare the public for the compromise and
						Senator Benton prepared the Senate. He brought the party leaders to agree in advance
						that if the proposal came to them they would act favorably on it. The most of the Whig
						leaders also consented to support the treaty. Thus assured, the President received the
						proposal, the Senate formally, by a vote of 38 to 12, advised him to accept it, and a
						treaty settling the boundary question was drawn, submitted to the Senate and ratified by
						a vote of 41 to 14. The vote was not on party lines. There were Democrats voting against
						the treaty (including Hannegan and Bright, from Indiana), and Whigs voting for it
						(including Webster and Corwin.) The Senate virtually took the initiative and the
						President found shelter and support behind nearly all of the powerful leaders in that
						body and in both parties. August 5, 1846, the treaty became the law of the land.</p>
					<p>There doubtless is an inside British history to this transaction and it may never be
						told. One version of Lord Aberdeen's sudden loss of interest is given in Agnes C. Laut's
						"Quest of the Great Northwest," and is referred to in Emerson Hough's novel, "Fifty-Four
						Forty or Fight."</p>
					<p>"The astonishing thing," Miss Laut says, "of the whole episode was that after insisting
						on joint occupancy for years and refusing to give up her claims, England suddenly
						kotowed flat without rhyme or reason. The friendship of the Hudson's Bay Company's chief
						factor, Dr. McLoughlin, for the incoming American settlers or Oregon has usually been
						given as the explanation. Some truth there may be in this, but the real reason is good
						enough to be registered as melodrama to the everlasting glory of a martinet officer's
						ignorance. Aberdeen was the British minister who had the matter in hand. His brother,
						Captain Gordon, in the Pacific squadron was ordered to take a look over the disputed
						region. In vain the fur traders of Oregon and Vancouver island spread the choicest game
						on his table. He could not have his English bath. He could not have the comforts of his
						English bed. He had bad luck deerstalking and worse luck fishing. Asked if he did not
						think the mountains magnificent, his response was that he would not give the bleakest
						hill in Scotland for all these mountains in a heap. Meanwhile, the Hudson's Bay Company
						was wasting candle light in London preparing the British case for the retention of
						Oregon. Matters hung fire. Should it be joint occupancy, "54-40 or fight," or
						compromise? Aberdeen's brother on leave home was called in.</p>
					<p>"Oregon? Oregon?" Yes, Gordon remembered Oregon. Been <pb id="VAB9260-017" n="17"/>
						there fishing last year, and "the fish wouldn't rise to the fly worth a d---! Let the
						old country go!" This in a country where fish might be scooped out in tubfuls without
						either fly or line!</p>

				<div2 type="section">
					<head rend="center">TERMS OF THE TREATY.</head>

					<p>By the treaty adopted the parallel of 49 degrees was continued westward from the Rocky
						mountains to the middle of the channel which separates the island of Vancouver from the
						continent and thence in a southwesterly direction through the middle of the channel and
						the Straits of Juan de Fuca to the Pacific ocean. Navigation of the Columbia river south
						of 49 degrees was granted to British subjects, and the farms, lands, and other property
						of the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, north of the river, were duly confirmed to
						it.</p>
					<p>The territory that was thus released to the United States from British claim and
						partial occupancy amounted to 292,000 square miles or nearly one-twelfth of our domain
						on this continent. (Oregon, Washington and Idaho and about 28,000 square miles of
						Montana and 13,000 square miles of Wyoming.) In a summary of his conclusions in a recent
						publication of W. I. Marshall's Acquisition of Oregon it is recalled that this is the
						only territory which the United States claims by priority of discovery, exploration and
						settlement. It is the only territory on this continent which we have obtained without
						either conquest or cash purchase. It was this region that originated so much of the
						Monroe doctrine as declares, "that the American continents, by the free and independent
						position they have assumed, are to be henceforth no longer regarded as open to
						colonization by any European nation." (J. Q. Adams, Secretary of State, July 22, 1823,
						in letters to Henry Middleton, minister to Russia, and Richard Rush, minister to
						England.)</p>
					<p>The United States retained possession of the valley of the Columbia and its
						tributaries. Puget Sound was ours, and a free outlet to the sea through the straits
						south of Vancouver, the largest island on the coast, which remained in the hands of
						Great Britain.</p>
					<p>One can not read the exuberant literature relating to this territory without absorbing
						some of the regret that has been expressed, that we did not establish our claim to the
						approximate northern source of the Columbia and the latitude of MacKenzie's and Frazer's
						explorations. John Quincy Adams when Secretary of State, twitted Mr. Canning, the
						British minister, on the extravagant English claims on the Pacific coast:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"You claim India; you claim Africa, and I have not heard that you claim exclusively
							any part of the moon; but there is not a spot on this habitable globe that I could
							affirm that you do not claim."</p></q>
					<p>Mr. Adams's biographer in the American Statesman Series says that Adams's temperament
						was such that he always saw the greater chance of success in strong and spirited
						conduct. His irascibility and fighting quality that proved to be the elements of
						weakness in domestic politics, were sources of strength in his conduct with foreign
						nations. But neither as Secretary of State nor as President had he been able to induce
						the British, whom he so thoroughly understood, to surrender their claims to British
						Columbia. As he could not succeed <pb id="VAB9260-018" n="18"/> it would be expecting
						too much to look for success under less favorable circumstances from Polk and Buchanan.
						Even had the United States acquired British Columbia its people would have been no
						happier than they are and certainly its cities would not have been so well governed.</p>
					<p>The one sentiment that comes to Americans in contemplating the great British northwest
						grows out of the love of land and territory; the other and broader view considers the
						welfare of the people under whatever form of government they may live. More Americans
						are going into Canadian territory in late years than ever went before. They are not
						afraid of the British flag and are willing to live under its folds. But in the period
						under discussion, the British sovereignty was hateful and, as we have seen, our people
						would have once more gone to war with the mother country rather than have given up the
						Columbia river.</p>
					<p>Technically, we had shadow of title north of 49 degrees, but we had not colonized to
						any extent, north of that parallel. The British through the Hudson's Bay Company lost
						the region beteen 49th parallel and the Columbia river, which they had in part occupied
						and even fortified, but they held the territory north of the 49th parallel which we
						claimed but had not possessed, and which the Hudson's Bay people, never for an instant
						abating in allegiance to the crown, had colonized and over which they had trapped and
						hunted. That which we as Americans fairly deserved without relying exclusively on the
						discoveries of the Spaniards or Russians, whose successors we became, we largely
						attained. England would never, except on compulsion, have surrendered an outlet on the
						Pacific. She might finally have given us a bigger slice of the disputed territory, but
						this seems improbable inasmuch as the 49th degree of latitude had long before been
						accepted as the dividing line east of the Rockies. A straight line west along this
						latitude had come to be regarded as a natural result of the prolonged contention. The
						most that could have been expected was the continuation of this line through Vancouver
						island to the sea.</p>
					<p>The 49th was the parallel that was most in the public mind except for the comparatively
						brief period when 54-40 was the slogan. It was the line of compromise westward from the
						Lake of the Woods and it had been repeatedly proposed and had even been assented to at
						one time by Adams, who was wont to claim to 51 or 54-40 according to the vehemence of
						the opposition which he was meeting from Great Britain.</p>
					<p>It is apparent that the controlling influences of the Democratic party did not
						seriously care for Oregon. Western Democrats and the north generally were in earnest in
						their demand for a settlement of this controversy on a basis of the justice of the
						nation's claims. The south wanted Texas and southern Democrats were willing to accept
						Oregon and to couple a demand for both Oregon and Texas in the platform as the surest
						way to the success of the Texas program. When Texas was finally annexed and the Oregon
						question stood out naked and alone the administration problem was to go as far as it had
						to and to stop as short as circumstances would permit. Even if all of Oregon were
						acquired there was no reason to anticipate that a foot of slave territory would be
						added. For Texas and every state constructed out of it two senators would be added who
						naturally would become supporters of <pb id="VAB9260-019" n="19"/> slavery. But the
						northwest did not raise cotton and the other products incident to slave territory, and
						besides a war with Great Britain, or the moral influence of British hostility to slavery
						would be extremely awkward while the fight with Mexico was on.</p>
					<p>On the other hand the south having secured Texas, the north, including even northern
						Democrats of both the Hannegan and Benton types, and the abolitionists and for the most
						part the Whigs, saw an embarrassment in the abandonment of party pledges, and contended
						that the anti-slave states should not be tricked out of an increase in territorial
						addition comparable with the gain that had come to the south.</p>
					<p>When the bill for the establishment of a territorial government in Oregon came before
						the Senate it was resisted by Mr. Calhoun, who took the position that there was no power
						in Congress to abolish slavery in the territories. The Oregon bill contained, of course,
						the anti-slavery principle of the ordinance of 1787 and of the Missouri compromise. Mr
						Calhoun had forgotten or ignored the fact that he himself was a member of President
						Monroe's cabinet when the Missouri compromise was pending. This cabinet held to the
						constitutionality of the compromise and doubtless it would not have been passed if the
						cabinet had advised against it.</p>
					<p>Repeatedly afterwards Mr. Calhoun in the Senate had favored legislation that was
						predicated on the Missouri compromise. And yet when it came to the organization without
						slavery of the Oregon territory, which, as President Polk afterwards in a message
						approving of the bill related, is 330 miles north of the slavery line established by the
						compromise, Senator Calhoun with every artifice of what Mr. Benton called his "diseased
						imagination" sought to extend the Constitution automatically over the acquired Oregon
						territory and to prevent in every way an admission of any sort that this soil should be
						free. He pronounced the southern men who voted for the territorial bill as traitors to
						the south and declared that by reason of the admission of Oregon without slaves "the
						separation of the north and the south is completed." He concluded his speech on the
						Oregon bill and the agitation in relation to the organization of Oregon without slavery
						as follows:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"Now, let me say, Senators, if our Union and system of government are doomed to
							perish, and we to share the fate of so many great people who have gone before us, the
							historian who in some future day may record the events tending to so calamitous a
							result, will devote his first chapter to the ordinance of 1787, as lauded as it and
							its authors have been, as the first of that series which led to it. His next chapter
							will be devoted to the Missouri compromise; and the next to the present agitation.
							Whether there will be another beyond I know not. It will depend on what we may
							do."</p></q>
					<p>Mr. Benton, refuting Mr. Calhoun and speaking also prophetically, declared that of
						these three causes of the anticipated dissolution of the Union which Mr. Benton prized
						so highly and Mr. Calhoun so lightly the ordinance of 1787 was voted for by every slave
						state then in existence; the Missouri compromise of 1820 was supported by Mr. Calhoun
						himself and the power of the south, and the Oregon agitation of <pb id="VAB9260-020"
							n="20"/> 1848 had for its sole architect Mr. Calhoun himself, for he was the founder
						of opposition to free soil in Oregon. "The historian," Mr. Benton declared, "will have
						to say that none of these causes dissolved the Union; and that historian may have to
						relate that a fourth cause did it--and one from which Mr. Calhoun recoiled--the reversal
						of the Missouri compromise, because it would disturb the peace and harmony of the
						Union."</p>
					<p>The massacre of Dr. Whitman and his band of missionaries followed by the appeal to the
						federal government for protection against the Indians at last had weight with Congress
						and a territorial government was proclaimed nearly three years after the settlement of
						the boundary line, with General Joseph Lane, of Indiana, as first Governor. The mere
						mention of the missionaries will bring to mind another chapter in Oregon history and
						raise the old question as to whether Dr. Whitman, as so eloquently claimed in the early
						days of this controversy, had much if anything to do with the settlement of the boundary
						question favorable to the United States. The weight of evidence from recent voluminous
						literature tends to prove that Dr. Whitman with his wagon did not "save Oregon," but it
						seems invidious to single out any one person from among all those who sought this
						western land under whatever honorable impulse and mark him either for exclusive
						distinction or reproach.</p>

					<head rend="center">THE FUCAN STRAIT ARBITRATION.</head>

					<p>There was still one point of difference that remained unsettled even by the treaty of
						1846. The boundary line was to extend along the 49th parallel to a point where the
						mainland touched the waters of the Pacific. Thence it was to run in a southwesterly
						direction through the middle of the channel in the Fucan Strait south of Vancouver. In
						this wide Strait, sown thickly with islands, it developed after the treaty, there were
						at least two channels out to the sea. If Great Britain could claim the more southerly
						channel she could throw the greater part of those islands into the northern part of the
						waters which were British. One of these islands was of considerable size and importance,
						San Juan. Great Britain set up a claim to the southerly channel, took possession of San
						Juan and the other islands north of this channel. All of the old fires of the Oregon
						controversy were rekindled. The dispute became nationwide, troops were sent to the scene
						and on the verge of conflict joint occupancy of San Juan was agreed on pending a
						settlement. There were long years of controversy, intermittent in their ferocity, and
						finally the questions at issue were referred, in 1872, to King William of Germany, as
						arbitrator. George Bancroft, the historian, presented the case for the United States, in
						noble language, from which I take these lines:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"The treaty of which the interpretation is referred to Your Majesty's arbitrament was
							ratified more than a quarter of a century ago. Of the sixteen members of the British
							cabinet which framed and presented it for the acceptance of the United States, Sir
							Robert Peel, Lord Aberdeen, and all the rest but one, are no more. The British
							minister at Washington, who signed it, is dead. Of American statesmen concerned in it,
							the minister at London, the President and <pb id="VAB9260-021" n="21"/>
							Vice-President, the Secretary of State, and every one of the President's
							constitutional advisers, except one, have pased away. I alone remain, and after
							finishing the three score years and ten that are the days of our years, am selected by
							my country to uphold its rights. Six times the United States had received the offer of
							arbitration on their northwestern boundary, and six times had refused to refer a point
							where the importance was so great and the right so clear. But, when consent was
							obtained to bring the question before Your Majesty, my country resolved to change its
							policy, and in the heart of Europe, before a tribunal from which no judgment but a
							just one can emanate, to explain the solid foundation of our demand, and the
							principles of moderation and justice by which we have been governed. The case involves
							questions of geography, of history, and of international law, and we are glad that the
							discussion should be held in the midst of a nation whose sons have been trained in
							those sciences by a Carl Ritter, a Ranke, and a Heffter."</p></q>
					<p>King William's decision follows:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"After examination of the treaty concluded at Washington on the 6th of May, 1781,
							between the governments of her Britannic majesty and of the United States of America,
							according to which the said governments have submitted to our arbitrament the question
							at issue between them, whether the boundary line which, according to the treaty of
							Washington of June 15, 1846, after being carried westward along the 49th parallel of
							northern latitude to the middle of the channel which separates the continent from
							Vancouver island, is thence to be drawn southerly through the middle of the west
							channel and of the Fuca Straits to the Pacific ocean, should be drawn through the
							Rosario channel as the government of her Britannic majesty claims, or through the Haro
							channel as the government of the United States claims; to the end of that we may
							finally and without appeal decide which of these claims is most in accordance with the
							true interpretation of the treaty of June 14, 1846.</p></q>
					<p>"After hearing the report made to us by the experts and jurists summoned by us upon the
						contents of the interchanged memorials and their appendices----</p>
					<p>"Have decreed the following award:</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"Most in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty concluded on the 15th
							of June, 1846, between the governments of her Britannic majesty and of the United
							States of America, is the claim of the government of the United States that the
							boundary line between the territories of her Britannic majesty and the United States
							should be drawn through the Haro (or northern) channel.</p></q>
					<p>"Authenticated by our autographic signature and the impression of the imperial
						seal.</p>
					<p>"Given at Berlin, October 21st, 1872.</p>
					<p>(L. S.) <hi rend="right">"WILLIAM."</hi></p>
					<pb id="VAB9260-022" n="22"/>
					<p>In his annual message of December 2, 1872, President Grant, referring to the award of
						the Emperor of Germany, said.</p>
					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"This award confirms the United States in their claim to the important archipelago of
							islands lying between the continent and Vancouver island * * * and leaves us, for the
							first time in the history of the United States as a nation, without a question of
							disputed boundary between our territory and the possessions of Great Britain on this
							continent." So ended this controversy. Fittingly and as becomes civilized nations, the
							issues were finally settled without resort to force. There were few years in all the
							long period after Captain Gray crossed the stormy bar of the Great River of the West,
							when there might not have been war. But, as one of our own essayists has recently
							asked, "Why war?"</p></q>
					<p>When the United States acquired Alaska by purchase in 1867, we came into the possession
						of a long, narrow strip of coast line that extends far to the south of the main Alaskan
						peninsula. We did not fight our way up to 54-40, but we came peacefully down to that
						latitude and thus at last we reached the long sought goal.</p>
