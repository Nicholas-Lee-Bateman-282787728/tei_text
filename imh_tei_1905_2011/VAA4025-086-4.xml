            <p>The trans-Appalachian West was an open and rapidly growing frontier region at the end of the
                    eighteenth century. The lure of abundant and productive land, relatively easy river transportation,
                    and a considerably diminished threat of Indian attacks helped to swell settlements on both sides of
                    the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. Immigrants drawn from the older regions of the country by the
                    economic promises and opportunities of the Ohio Valley brought with them familiar customs, habits,
                    and beliefs, which they fully expected to transplant in their new communities. Religion was perhaps
                    the most visible and important of cultural institutions, but the nearly unlimited opportunities to
                    establish churches in the trans—Appalachian West were fraught with special problems.
                    Foremost among these was the difficulties most Protestant denominations had in supplying clergy fast
                    enough to keep up with the westering population. Partly in response to this problem, many churches
                    developed innovative practices suited to frontier conditions, such as a circuit-riding clergy,
                    missionary churches and ministers, establishment of frontier colleges to train ministers, and
                    protracted outdoor camp meetings.</p>
            <p>The camp meetings of the Second Great Awakening, which coincided with the flood of immigration after
                    1795, contributed powerfully to sustaining enthusiasm for religion on the frontier, but the revivals
                    intensified other problems. The threat of schismatic splintering among religion-starved settlers who
                    fell under the sway of independent-minded clergy and the interdemoninational competition for members
                    stirred by the revival imperiled the order and integrity of established denominations. Presbyterians

                    <pb n="348" id="VAA4025-086-4-008"/> were concerned by these problems because they insisted that
                    only an educated and orthodox ministry be licensed to spread religion on the frontier. They held
                    that a well-trained clergy was especially critical for maintaining congregations amidst the fluidity
                    and uncertainties of newly settled regions, but such men were often hard to find. In this context,
                    early Kentucky Presbyterians were perhaps fortunate to discover among their young settlers James
                    Welsh, a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>-born pioneer who seemed to have all the qualifications the Presbyterian church required
                    for propagating religion in the West.</p>
            <p>Welsh was university trained, experienced as a revival preacher, and enthusiastic about bringing
                    piety and Christian order to the often confused and gospel-hungry settlements. In spite of his
                    enthusiasm, Welsh did not waver from the Calvinism that was Presbyterian orthodoxy. These qualities
                    made him especially attractive, and the governing Transylvania Presbytery did not hesitate to
                    recruit Welsh just as he was finishing his religious studies in early 1792. Like many other
                    Presbyterian ministers determined to uphold Calvinist orthodoxy in the midst of the turmoil of the
                    Second Great Awakening, Welsh faced difficult challenges. From outside the church, he strove to hold
                    back the tide of irreligion, deism, and liberal fashions that accompanied Enlightenment thinking and
                    political Republicanism. From within, Welsh shunned the emotional excesses of the camp meetings and
                    opposed Arminian tendencies that grew out of popular revivalism, such as the possibility of personal
                    and universal redemption, although he counted himself among the revivalist preachers. In addition,
                    he fought against those later Presbyterians whose Arminian evangelism led them to benevolent reform,
                    social and political activism, and an impatience with those who stood in their way of perfecting the
                    world.</p>
            <p>In spite of his preparation and qualifications, Welsh did not prevail in any of his important
                    encounters with adversity and consequently failed to make good on the opportunities the frontier
                    offered. He was hounded out of his prestigious post as a faculty member of Transylvania University
                    before 1800, dismissed from his church at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, some years later, and suspended
                    from the ministry while attending the needs of a struggling congregation at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, just a year before his tragic death in 1826. In place of welcome, praise, and
                    a gradual rise in esteem and position, Welsh encountered hostility, condemnation, and disgrace.
                    Although he had all the prerequisites a Presbyterian minister needed, Welsh did not thrive. Was it
                    simply that he was unpopular and that his orthodoxy was out of fashion among the frontiersmen he was
                    dedicated to serve?</p>
            <p>It seems ironic that among the heroes of frontier revivalism, which included several preachers who
                    began their careers as Presbyterians, <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-086-4-009"/> were men who subverted
                    the goals of established churches, overthrew tradition, and founded new denominations. These were
                    the successes among the frontier clergy. Welsh of course could not take this route to immortality,
                    but his inability and unwillingness to adjust to popular tastes in religion provide only part of an
                    explanation of his failure. Welsh's life suggests that there may have been a greater irony
                    in the Second Great Awakening: the frontier revivals likely served to constrain Welsh's
                    opportunities rather than to enlarge them. The evangelical revival movement, with its implicit
                    Arminian message and abandonment of strict Calvinist theology, swept over nearly all Protestant
                    denominations during the antebellum years. Welsh simply could not abide by the calls to action the
                    converted found implicit in the evangelical message of personal and universal redemption, whether
                    untutored biblical literalism, physical and emotional devotions, or sober calls for organized social
                    reform.</p>
            <p>James Welsh was born in Virginia prior to the Revolution and may have been in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, as early as 1781. Little else is known about his upbringing,
                    although it is evident from his earliest years in Kentucky that he was well educated and committed
                    as a young man to a religious calling. Sent out by the Synod of Virginia as a missionary during the
                    fall and winter of 1790–1791, Welsh preached among outlying Kentucky settlements as a
                    licentiate of the governing Transylvania Presbytery.1 He then entered the Kentucky Academy (later
                    Transylvania University) in November, 1791, as a divinity student and boarded with Colonel Robert
                    Patterson, a <placeName>

                    two years and probably earned his medical degree while preparing himself for the ministry.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Welsh was encouraged as a student to apply for membership in the Transylvania Presbytery, but a deep
                    anxiety about his spiritual condition made him reluctant to take that step. "I am in

                    also admitted some ambivalence about leaving Kentucky and the friends he had made there. He confided
                    in a letter to Patterson that he might return to <placeName>

                    filled with many new cares and perplexities. A year later, his ambivalence gave way to greater
                    anxieties, especially over losing contact with Patterson. "I am sometimes a little afraid
                    that you have altogether forgotten me," Welsh wrote to his friend, and he complained that
                    Patterson had not written once since he left <placeName>

                    unfriendly world" and hoped to be at Patterson's house again by the spring of

                    hymnal, claiming that only the literal versions of the Psalms were fit to sing in church. In 1789,
                    after Rankin began denying communion to those who dared disagree with him, a portion of the
                    congregation brought charges against the revival minister before the Transylvania Presbytery. The
                    case was not heard until 1792, but before the presbytery could formally expel the schismatic
                    preacher, Rankin withdrew from its jurisdiction. Most of his Mt. Zion congregation followed their
                    radical minister into the ultra-conservative Scottish Associate Reformed Church, leaving only a
                    minority to proclaim itself the loyal First Presbyterian Church of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the first few years after Welsh's return were probably the high point of his
                    life. He seems to have been well accepted by the congregation, although he was obliged to practice
                    medicine to support his family between 1796 and 1799 because the congregation could not afford to
                    pay him a full salary. Welsh became involved in civic affairs, including service as a trustee of the
                    Kentucky Academy at the time it was transformed into Transylvania University in 1799. Within the
                    year, he was appointed professor of languages at the university.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Perhaps most
                    significant for Welsh's years in his adopted home was the presence of Patterson, his friend
                    and confidant since at least 1791. When the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s most respected Presbyterian laymen. Patterson had undoubtedly used his
                    influence to help Welsh secure his appointments to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> church and to Transylvania University, as Patterson was a trustee of both. Indeed,
                    Welsh came to rely on his older friend for emotional and other more tangible kinds of support. Their
                    friendship developed into an intimate and life-long relationship upon which Welsh came to depend to

                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> unfortunately did not last long. When he defended Presbyterian orthodoxy in the face of
                    attacks both from liberal and revival camps soon after taking his university chair, he placed
                    himself in the very center of doctrinal and political controversy. Liberals, who espoused
                    Jeffersonian political beliefs and religious deism, had gained a strong place in Kentucky society,
                    and in 1801 they demanded that Welsh resign his position at Transylvania. Liberal students charged
                    that Welsh favored Presbyterian and Federalist scholars; that he was intolerant, emotional, and
                    impatient with those whose views differed from his own; and that he was often inattentive to his
                    duties. Welsh did have a tendency toward haughtiness, and his high-toned Federalism and
                    Presbyterianism were clearly an unpopular combination in republican <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. In spite of the charges and the public spectacle the controversy prompted, the
                    orthodox majority on the university's board of trustees was eager to uphold Welsh and the
                    forces of religious and political conservatism, even though they did not like him and found him to
                    be difficult and intractable. An official inquiry cleared Welsh of any misconduct, but continuing
                    student pressure, public humiliation, and popular feeling against him forced him to resign.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    swept across Kentucky in 1801, although there were no indications that he was anything but orthodox
                    in his theology.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Meanwhile, other Presbyterian revivalists were preaching a
                    mixture of Arminianism and antinomianism that directly contradicted Calvinist doctrines of
                    predestination and limited grace. This mixture presented a special dilemma for Welsh during 1802 and
                    1803 when the Synod of Kentucky heard complaints against certain New Light ministers. Richard
                    McNemar and John Thompson had been charged with deviation from church doctrine, Arminianism, and
                    preaching dangerous and pernicious ideas. The synod upheld the charges by a seventeen to six vote,
                    concluding the ministers' views were "essentially different from
                    Calvinism." Although Welsh voted with the minority, he did not lose the confidence of the
                    presbytery; indeed, perhaps because of his sympathies he was named to a select <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> when he was twice brought into county court for holding slaves on his farm. His

                    for slavery would have been reason enough. It is likely that personal animosity between Patterson
                    and Cooper, the area's two largest landowners and natural competitors for prestige and
                    office, was also a significant factor. Patterson was found innocent of holding slaves in one case

                    strengthened his ties to the family. In other situations, this would have been a fortuitous union,

                    </placeName> a prosperous commercial center but also by their vision of the central role the church
                    might play in ordering the community. Their view of religion's social role had been
                    influenced by the currents of Presbyterian and Congregational evangelicalism that were just
                    gathering in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. Northern evangelicalism suggested a modified
                    version of the Calvinist doctrine of election, which allowed for greater individual initiative in
                    seeking personal salvation and encouraged social reform activities. These evangelical reformers
                    scorned the southern-style revivals for their undisciplined emotionalism, yet they were no more
                    comfortable with the doctrinal orthodoxy that Welsh and other conservative revivalists offered. Many
                    of the Jersey men and their allies may not have cared to defend the particularities of election,
                    humankind's inability to save itself, and special redemption, but they placed more emphasis
                    on one's ability to effect a spiritual change within and to reform society at large. In
                    this emphasis they probably differed with Welsh because they sought to use the church as a base for
                    wide-ranging social reforms predicated on the assumption that organized people could do much to
                    change the social and moral condition of the world.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                    after 1806. The effect was to leave the session essentially friendly to Welsh and in a position to
                    frustrate his critics. The session was also remiss in its duties, perhaps deliberately so. It did
                    not keep minutes of its meetings, as required, and rarely forwarded congregational reports to the
                    presbytery. Deliberate or not, the session's laxities worked to frustrate Welsh's
                    detractors. There could be no accurate accounting of members without session records, which might
                    have made it easier for Welsh to disguise the extent of division among the congregation. Similarly,
                    the presbytery may have found it difficult to take action against Welsh without specific complaints

                    1808 when it wrote to Welsh inquiring why he had not attended presbytery meetings for two years. It
                    hoped that his absences were not intentional, but offered him a reasonable chance to explain. <placeName>

                    responsibility for the church's physical property and finances. Control of the
                    congregation's finances provided one opportunity for Welsh's enemies to gain
                    control of the church and perhaps oust him, for although they were not a majority on the board, they
                    were by far the wealthiest men in town. They had already made Welsh uncomfortable by denying him a
                    salary; they could also use their wealth to insinuate themselves into positions of power. Thus when
                    the trustees proposed building a meetinghouse (the congregation met in the county courthouse after
                    selling their log cabin in 1804), a door was opened for Welsh's eventual downfall. The
                    trustees began in 1807 by applying to the county for deeds to four donation lots offered by
                    proprietor Cooper. The prospect of owning real estate and a building in turn prompted the board to
                    seek incorporation for the church. The special act of incorporation was introduced into the Ohio
                    legislature by Cooper, who was also a state senator, and finally passed its required third reading
                    in 1812. It granted the church the right to raise subscriptions, buy and sell property, and other
                    privileges, although the trustees had engaged in some of these practices already. It also required
                    new elections to the board, which provided an opportunity Welsh's reform-minded opponents
                        exploited.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 1812 election for trustees resulted in a rough balance between the Welsh and reform factions, as
                    did the balloting the following year. The mixed board proceeded slowly, doing little more than
                    clearing a new graveyard and buying a more favorable building lot. The 1814 election brought some of
                    the long-smoldering conflict into the open, as questions were raised concerning who had the right to
                    vote. Because there were no records of members and the charter was silent on the matter, the board
                    declared that those persons who believed themselves to be baptized, who resided within ten miles of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and who contributed to the congregation were eligible to vote. As the session kept no
                    baptismal records either, residence and contribution to the church were the operating criteria,
                    which favored the evangelical reform faction led by Cooper. The trustees drew up a list of
                    twenty-eight men who were declared voting members, and a majority of them were men known to oppose
                    Welsh. Seventeen of these men actually voted, and, not surprisingly, four of the five trustees they
                    chose (Cooper, Horatio G. Phillips, Mathew Patton, and James Steele) were among the leading
                    reformers and most prominent residents. The formal exchange of offices took place under unusual
                    circumstances and amid deep mistrust and evident ill will. The outgoing and incoming <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>The new trustees immediately embarked on a plan to build a brick meetinghouse near the center of
                    town, which required an additional $250 to purchase a more desirable lot from proprietor
                    Cooper. Building costs already exceeded several thousand dollars, but some of the wealthiest and
                    most prominent reformers were not entirely satisfied. They wanted a clear mandate for an even larger
                    meetinghouse than planned, including the addition of a second story and steeple, since the leading
                    reformers were willing to pay for it. In preparation for the next annual trustee elections, they
                    contrived to tighten requirements for voting a second time as a means of securing the election of
                    men who would support their grand plan. The trustees obliged by declaring prior to the 1815 poll
                    that none but residents of the town and neighborhood who had contributed to the building of the
                    meetinghouse or to the support of the minister and who were willing to come under the government of
                    the church were eligible to vote. These new qualifications demanded a more specific financial
                    commitment to the church and excluded most of Welsh's few remaining supporters. Just twelve
                    men voted in 1815 and elected a board dominated by the ambitious reformers.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    </placeName> when it met there in April, 1816. It concluded that a second request for supply from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName> was disorderly, in spite of the difficulties over Welsh, because it found no genuine
                    cause for complaint against him; the presbytery also admonished the trustees for not providing Welsh
                    with adequate salary. When it realized that the church was hopelessly divided, it advised the
                    congregation to lay aside contention and be satisfied with ministers the presbytery could supply
                    "until God in his providence shall send them a pastor to whom the affections of the people
                    may generally be united." As a compromise, the presbytery proposed that Welsh serve part
                    time, provided the church compensate him. It also dropped its investigation into the source of the
                    scandalous newspaper article and directed the elders to be more attentive to the congregation. Two
                    months later, the presbytery directed the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Confident of the eventual outcome of the crisis, the reformers went ahead with plans to replace
                    Welsh. In June, they circulated a subscription for the support of one Reverend Moses Allen for a
                    year, which was signed by all sitting trustees. Seventy-eight men subscribed $656, with
                    Cooper, Phillips, Steele, and Joseph Pierce the major contributors. Despite Allen's evident
                    support from a large portion of the congregation, once again the presbytery refused <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s request for services of a minister other than Welsh. Instead, it suggested
                    that elders James Miller and John H. Williams conduct a poll of the congregation to determine if
                    Welsh should be retained. In the meantime, it allowed Welsh to serve the church at his
                        discretion.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The presbytery gave him the benefit of every doubt, but Welsh became despondent as it became clear he
                    would not last much longer. His support was weakening even among the elders, and he probably knew
                    the poll of the congregation would show little enthusiasm for keeping him. He complained to
                    Patterson that he was "nearly broken down" and accused his old friend of
                    abandoning him and his daughter to suffer "anything &amp; everything, that may <list type="footnotes">

                    presbytery, and the new session met without Welsh. Reverend Peter Monfort, "moderator by
                    invitation," opened a session book in May, 1817, and began the business of bringing the

                    be allowed to preach two Sundays a month in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They accompanied it with a subscription for $166 toward his salary. The
                    list of forty-four petitioners and the meagerness of the subscription revealed the shallowness of
                    Welsh's support. Only ten signers had any previous or subsequent association with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>

                    petitioners, while none of the reform trustees cared to retain Welsh. Among prominent non-members
                    was Patterson, who came out of his self-imposed exile to aid his friend.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> This
                    petition drive was no effort to retain Welsh in the pulpit; rather the Kentucky revivalists realized
                    that support for their minister had collapsed utterly and that he would be forced out. Their effort
                    was instead aimed at establishing a Second Presbyterian Church. Welsh himself moderated the meeting
                    that elected trustees for the proposed second church; among those named were Hood and Robinson, two
                    of Welsh's most loyal allies among the old trustees and elders, and Henry L. Brown, another
                    Patterson son-in-law, but a man who also had no previous association with the <placeName>

            <p>The crisis over Welsh broke during 1817. The presbytery that assembled in April considered the

                    without a regular income, he was naturally under great pressure to provide for his family. His
                    medical practice, drugstore, and other business ventures suffered under the depressed economic
                    conditions following the banking panic of 1819. Increasingly, he turned his attentions to his
                    faltering businesses and to the immediate needs of his family at the expense of his ministerial
                        duties.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Welsh was thus under a great deal of strain after 1822. In addition to his evident ill health and
                    poor financial condition, he was advancing in years and had few options left. He must have also been
                    bitterly disappointed by his failure as a minister and the wretched condition in which he found
                    himself near the end of his life. Welsh was desperate and turned to alcohol to relieve his pains.
                    The presbytery could perhaps excuse his absences and failures to perform minsterial duties for
                    reasons of health or overwork, but when word reached its ears that Welsh had taken to excessive
                    drinking, it could no longer remain impassive. On April 18, 1825, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> Presbytery opened a formal investigation into Welsh's conduct at <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Welsh tried to delay the three-man investigating committee appointed to go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and make inquiries, claiming that however innocent he might be, damage to his character
                    would result from the public nature of the investigation. Nevertheless, the committee would not
                    alter its charge and went ahead with its inquiries. Its report to the presbytery in July cited three
                    specific chargeable sins under the discipline of the church: intemperate use of wine and strong
                    spirits, unfair dealings in the transaction of temporal business, and neglect of church interests.
                    Welsh was ordered to appear at <placeName>

                    </placeName> to answer the charges before a special meeting of the presbytery.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The presbytery opened the trial on Wednesday, August 10, 1825, expecting it to last only two or three
                    days, but a series of tragic delays stretched it out to more than a week, thoroughly exasperating
                    the presbytery and driving Welsh to distraction. On the first day of the trial, Welsh requested a
                    delay on account of the severe illness (probably typhoid) that had struck his family. One day was
                    granted, but on Thursday, the trial resumed with Welsh's innocent plea and the calling of
                    the first witnesses. On Friday, the trial was interrupted by a local physician, who reported that

                            1822 and 1825, but the presbytery usually accepted Welsh's explanations for his
                            absences. His reasons were not recorded, but Welsh had cited ill health in the past; and it
                            is likely this may have been his stated excuse again. <placeName>

                    requested an indefinite delay, but the presbytery granted only a two-hour suspension for him to
                    attend to his family. Welsh, obviously agitated by the presbytery's refusal to accommodate
                    him in this crisis, initially refused to return, but after assurances that he would be given leave
                    to rush home in case of any emergency, Welsh relented and the trial resumed.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preoccupied by his family's crisis and the imminent death of Hester, Welsh repeatedly sought
                    time to attend to his family, but the presbytery stubbornly insisted on proceeding through Saturday.
                    After Hester's death on Sunday, the presbytery allowed Welsh only a two-hour break on
                    Monday for the funeral. When testimony concluded on Wednesday of the second week, Welsh was in no
                    condition to mount a defense, but again, the presbytery rejected pleas for a further delay. Welsh
                    finally walked out of the trial and refused to return. Even this did not stop the
                    presbytery's relentless quest for a judgment. It deemed Welsh's conduct
                    contumacious and decided unanimously that the evidence substantiated all charges.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The presbytery concluded that the sin of drunkenness had been supported by several witnesses on two
                    specific occasions. Welsh's defenders focused on this charge, as it must have been
                    considered the most serious of the three, and cited the minster's advanced age and his
                    chronic afflictions as explanations for his erratic behavior. "Welsh's physical
                    inability, the inactivity of his eyes, the clumsiness of his tongue, as well as the irregularity of
                    his bodily motions," one anonymous defender wrote, "may all be accounted for upon
                    his complicated diseases which would be too tedious to explain." Welsh's physician
                    offered his diagnosis of chronic hydrothorax, which, he said, had worsened in recent weeks. Welsh
                    was thus compelled to take laxatives and other "drastic medicines," resulting in
                    anorexia, dyspepsy, and loss of appetite. The smell of whiskey on Welsh's breath, these
                    defenders suggested, was nothing more than the result of small amounts he took to relieve his
                        pain.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The presbytery was not impressed with this defnese and was no less harsh in its judgment of the other
                    two charges. Although <list type="footnotes">

                            uncertain. Welsh's wife Margaret bore a daughter Maria Eliza in 1807 by her first
                            husband, Dr. Samuel Venable, but Maria Eliza Venable married in 1826 and lived until 1880.

                    nevertheless showed "a course of conduct which is destitute of that openness, fairness, and
                    disinterestedness which the precepts of the gospel require." Finally, it judged the
                    evidence that Welsh neglected his duty as overwhelming. Perturbed by Welsh's demeanor
                    during the trial and noting the "gloomy aspect" that hung over the whole affair,
                    the presbytery showed no sympathy for Welsh's plight or recognition of his double distress.
                    The presbytery's only compassion was in inflicting the penalty of suspension, instead of
                    outright deposition, in hopes of later reconciliation.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Unfortunately, Welsh
                    could no longer be reconciled to the vicious visicitudes of an unfriendly world, as he once

                    and nearly bankrupt, Welsh committed suicide little more than a year afterward.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Welsh's ordeal and tragic failure on the frontier did not stem from lack of preparation,
                    opportunities, or influential friends. Welsh had a university degree and pursued professional
                    careers in ministry and medicine, both of which were in high demand on the frontier. Offices were
                    always open to him, and even after several disastrous experiences churches never failed to call for
                    his services. The presbyteries, too, continued to place him in positions of trust and responsibility
                    despite misgivings they may have had about his reliability. In addition to all the support he could
                    reasonably expect from the Presbyterian church, Welsh also relied on friend and patron Robert
                    Patterson, who helped him obtain positions in both <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, provided advice and counsel, and sustained his friend as best he could through
                    Welsh's life. Welsh seemed to have all that a man needed to succeed and prosper on the
                    frontier—and more.</p>
            <p>Welsh's difficulties stemmed from several factors: his personality and personal problems,
                    the downfall of his patron, the grim-ness of frontier conflict, and the political implications of
                    the Great Awakening. Welsh was undeniably a difficult person. He was cantankerous, intolerant, and
                    unreliable at the very least, and his haughtiness invited harsh treatment from men who had little
                    patience with him or his ideas. Welsh's rejections made him all the more resentful and
                    depressed, while his feelings of unworthiness cast a gloomy spell over his entire career. His
                    chronic ill health, overwork, and harassed life also took a heavy toll. Welsh finally turned to

                    that he would have had difficulty wherever he lived, but the frontier may have magnified his
                    problems.</p>
            <p>Patterson's influence and connections undoubtedly helped Welsh gain his university post and
                    pulpits. Even in half-formed frontier society, family and friendship ties counted for a great deal.
                    Welsh made the right connections, and they worked to his advantage early in his career; but his
                    relationship to Patterson went beyond the usual ties of patronage and friendship. Welsh also relied
                    on his father-in-law for emotional support, and this dependency made Welsh dangerously vulnerable.
                    When Patterson lost his status and influence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and withdrew from church and society, Welsh suffered a doubly devastating loss. He
                    could no longer depend on Patterson's stature to help build the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName> church, and Patterson's downfall also left Welsh with little protection from
                    his friend's powerful enemies. Welsh's fortunes were too closely identified with
                    his patron's, and when Patterson fell, Welsh was unable to loosen the bonds that tied them
                    together.</p>
            <p>Frontier society was also harsh and unforgiving, perhaps even cruel at times. It was certainly no
                    egalitarian meritocracy, where talent, experience, and hard work would guarantee reward. A
                    man's politics, religion, origins, and connections played as much a role in his ultimate
                    success as how hard he worked, and Welsh was certainly aware of these factors. Indeed, as a minister
                    and natural leader, he was inescapably drawn into the very center of political conflict. In each
                    place that Welsh sought to make home, religious issues had distinct social and political
                    implications; in each place there were ambitious men with their own agendas, little social
                    hierarchies in the making, and keen competition for office and leadership. This was true in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the popular majority held distinctly liberal religious and political views quite
                    opposed to those held by Welsh, and in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where a Jerseyite clique gained virtual control over the church and all facets of
                    social and political life. Both groups excluded Welsh and men like him who stood in their way.</p>
            <p>Although Welsh lacked the skills and flexibility needed to thrive amidst the conflict that was rife
                    on the frontier, the Great Awakening itself exacerbated both the nature of that conflict and
                    Welsh's troubles. The Calvinist orthodoxy of the Presbyterian church and the bleak social
                    and political precepts of a Calvinist world view were under attack by awakened evangelicals. The
                    preaching of the Great Awakening placed greater emphasis on spiritual rebirth, the ability to affect
                    one's own salvation, and the possibilities of perfecting this world. The social and
                    political implications of these and other liberating evangelical notions provided some with new
                    opportunities on the frontier, but they also raised havoc in a society that had no firm foundations.
                    Good men and <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-086-4-033"/> women disagreed about how best to carry out the
                    evangelical prescriptions for social salvation and fought over leadership of frontier communities,
                    but Welsh and others who held on to a dying orthodoxy had little to offer this new social order.
                    Welsh may have failed his mission on the frontier, but the social and political turmoil that
                    followed closely in the wake of the Great Awakening provided the special context that made his
                    success nearly impossible.</p>

            <p>When a contagious disease appears in a populated area, governing officials, health agents, and
                    concerned citizens need to move in harmony toward eradicating the unwelcomed pestilence. If all work
                    in symphony and the leadership not only knows what to do but is courageous enough to do what needs
                    to be done, then the contagion can usually be stopped before it becomes a serious epidemic. When,
                    however, there is dissension—when one group ignores or repudiates
                    another—trouble emerges.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, with the outbreak of smallpox during the fall of 1893. The medical community
                    disagreed on the nature of the affliction, local citizens ignored sensible precautions and thus
                    encouraged the spread of the malady, and city councilmen, who took quick and decisive steps on some
                    issues, refused for several weeks to enact a controversial measure necessary to prevent the spread
                    of this deadly disease.</p>

                    among the happy fairgoers. Instead he was in his medical office, one to which he had moved only a

                    day, when her face, neck, and limbs broke out. Once again the <placeName>

                    illness of an older Fox daughter with similar symptoms. Five weeks later, on August 15, Bunch paid a
                    visit to A. N. Shuttleworth's daughter who had a fever of 105 and numerous eruptions over
                    her body. It was at this point that Bunch decided he should notify the health <pb n="[377]" id="VAA4025-086-4-037"/>

                    Three other families with the illness lived in close proximity to these homes; only one family, that
                    of A. J. Campbell, did not live close by. The Campbells lived in Avondale, several blocks away.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> What <placeName>

                    do that August afternoon and at a subsequent meeting two days later, was to quarantine each infected
                    house, an act then known as domiciliary quarantine—to restrict a family to its home.
                    Yellow cardboard signs reading "Smallpox" were posted on contaminated houses, and
                    guards who had already had smallpox or had been vaccinated recently were stationed near the property
                    to prevent people from entering the house and to keep secluded family members from leaving the
                        premises.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Except for the Campbells, all of the infected families lived in an area bounded by Willard Street on

                    west. The area was eight blocks wide from north to south and sixteen blocks long from east to west.
                    To warn individuals that smallpox might be in the area, red flags were erected at these boundaries,
                    although the area itself was not cordoned off, only the infected houses.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>Eventually the city council took elaborate precautions in an attempt to prevent the spread of the
                    disease. The city provided groceries and other necessities for the quarantined families but
                    delivered them only to a safe distance from a contaminated house. From there the guards picked up
                    the provisions and carried them to the proper yard; when the guards were at a safe distance, a
                    member of the family came into the yard and took the goods into the house. Milk was poured into a
                    special pitcher, but the deliverer never touched the pitcher. Afterward a member of the family came
                    outside to get the milk. A guard at each house had a water bucket, likewise never touched by
                    infected persons, from which he poured water into another bucket left outside the house. When a
                    doctor entered a house where smallpox was present, he wore a rubber coat <list type="footnotes">

                    hips, and a rubber cap that fit closely over his head, leaving only his hands and a small portion of
                    his face exposed. Upon entering the premises, he put on the rubber suit and upon leaving the house
                    removed it and washed his hands and face in a solution of disinfectants. To show how serious
                    officials were to prevent the disease from spreading, they ordered all dogs and cats without tags
                    found running at large in the infected district to be killed.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even though the guards should have been unable to contract the disease, precautions were taken to
                    keep them from spreading it. Because they spent so many hours in the diseased area, it was thought
                    best that they remain in the district during their off hours. Thus a house was established in the
                    area where they could stay and sleep when not on duty. This house also had provisions for
                    incarcerating persons who disobeyed the quarantine laws, and at least two people were held there for
                    such violations before the epidemic passed.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time that the city council ordered a cordoning off of all infected houses, it also agreed
                    that as many people as possible should be vaccinated. Residents outside the contaminated area were
                    urged to get vaccinations; people living inside the diseased district were required to be
                    vaccinated. The council appointed five physicians to go throughout the infected area to give
                    vaccinations to as many people as possible and to do so as quickly as possible. Although residents
                    were charged fifty cents per vaccination, if an individual could not afford that amount, the city
                    would pay for the injection at the reduced rate of twenty-five cents.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite these precautions the first announcements of smallpox in the city created very little
                    excitement or interest. People were slow to believe that the disease was really smallpox. Prominent
                    in the group of disbelievers were a number of physicians, including Bunch, who maintained publicly
                    that the disease was chicken pox, not smallpox, and that both city officials and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> had overreacted. Furthermore, one of the daily newspapers and some of the confined
                    families doctored by Bunch shared skepticism about the presence of smallpox. These families resented
                    the actions of the health officers, refused to be vaccinated, complained loudly about being isolated
                    from other people, and defied the efforts at quarantine. The fact that from August 19 to August 25
                    there were no new cases of smallpox or chicken pox added credence to this argument.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>It is not surprising, then, that there were many violations of the quarantine by people already
                    living inside the infected district. There were numerous instances when family members exited the
                    rear of a house to visit neighbors or when friends came to visit via the back door, all while a
                    guard patrolled the front. Violations became so frequent that guards were eventually given authority
                    to arrest people who disregarded the regulations. The effectiveness of the quarantine was also
                    weakened when garbage collectors refused to collect trash and waste of families with smallpox.
                    Although officials had ordered that all such waste be well covered with chloride of lime and then
                    buried, the garbage remained outside the infected houses for days while the wind blew its
                    contamination to nearby homes.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                    </placeName> that fall. Nearly as time consuming and infinitely more frustrating was the struggle to
                    convince the public that a serious disease was present and that certain precautions must be followed
                    to prevent it from spreading throughout the whole community. County health officer Hugh Cowing
                    commented that at the beginning of the epidemic public and health officials had to fight not only
                    the disease but also "the surroundings and the people."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    arrived August 21, examined the afflicted, and in every case confirmed that the patients had
                    smallpox. Meeting with the city council that evening, Jamison emphatically stated that if the
                    disease were not eradicated before winter, it would become much worse. He then advised the absolute
                    quarantine of all infected and exposed persons and urged city leaders to establish a hospital or
                    pest house for those already afflicted.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next evening the city council, the newly created Committee on Public Safety, and interested
                    physicians gathered. Despite Jamison's strong recommendation, those at the meeting agreed
                    not to open a pest house. Although most of those present knew that a pest house was needed, they
                    admitted that since many in the city believed there was no smallpox in the community, the removal of
                    the afflicted to a hospital would be next to impossible. Until public opinion supported the
                    physicians, there would be no hospital. This refusal notwithstanding, one must be careful in
                    criticizing city <list type="footnotes">

                    after Jamison's visit. Russell declared all the patients had smallpox except the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, they did agree that diagnosis of smallpox was not always easily made. A mild case of
                    smallpox and a severe case of chicken pox, for a day or so, may puzzle even an experienced
                    physician. Cowing acknowledged that a number of cases in <placeName>

                    </placeName> were atypical in their slight rise of temperature, in their delay of the eruptions, and
                    in their presence of complications. An editorial in the October 7, 1893, issue of the <hi rend="i">Journal of the American Medical Association</hi> stated the problem succintly: "It is
                    simply impossible always in the early stages to differentiate these diseases [smallpox and chicken

                    </placeName>, however, helped to convince a number of citizens that smallpox was indeed in the city.
                    Even more convincing was the outbreak of several new cases of the disease. During the last few days
                    of August and the first week of September dozens of new cases were reported, at which time Emily
                    Russell's sixteen-year-old daughter, Mary Emma, died. The fact that several of the new
                    victims lived outside the infested district was particularly alarming. Obviously the disease was not
                    being restricted to a small area as had been hoped.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>As a result, the State Board of Health declared a quarantine in the city on September 7. In order to

                    </placeName> at possible risk to their health. Naturally such a warning drastically reduced the

            <p>The quarantine also carried with it restrictions on the free travel of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents. Anyone who wished to leave the city by rail was required to obtain a
                    certificate from a health official saying that he or she had been properly vaccinated and was free
                    from infection. The ticket agent at the train station was forbidden to sell anyone a ticket without
                    first seeing such a certificate. In addition, all baggage of people leaving the city by train had to
                    be disinfected, which required so much time and attention that a special boxcar was set aside
                    strictly for fumigation purposes; train officials urged passengers to get their luggage to the
                    station several hours in advance of departure so there would be no delay. There was, of course, a
                    charge for this special service. Each fumigated bag cost from fifteen to fifty cents depending on
                        size.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Additional efforts to keep the disease from spreading included suspension of library privileges and
                    burning of all books returned from the infected area. Furthermore, moving household goods from one
                    part of the city to another was not permitted, except on written permit of the health officer. All
                    public places were disinfected at city expense. Even the post office was told to fumigate every
                    piece of mail sent out from the city; all mail leaving the city was placed in a large sheet-iron box
                    four-feet square and six-feet high where it was fumigated for about an hour.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>On the same evening that the quarantine was issued, a citizens' meeting discussed the
                    epidemic and what might be done by citizens to assist in the disease's elimination. The
                    large attendance and the interest displayed indicated that the public finally realized that such a
                    serious matter could no longer be treated with indifference. The point was raised that taking
                    smallpox patients to a special hospital would be far better than the current method of domiciliary
                    quarantine. The arguments of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> and others were so convincing that a motion was made by one of the citizens to develop
                    at once a smallpox hospital and to investigate further what authority was needed to remove infected
                    persons to a hospital. The <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Previously the city council had declined to establish such a hospital because of insufficient public
                    support. Now with a citizens' group resolution, the council responded quickly and within
                    four days authorized the establishment of a smallpox hospital in the infected area. Health officials
                    hastily obtained the use of a large, two-story building at the corner of Ohmer (Memorial Drive) and
                    Heekin (Beacon Street), just south of Galliher Woods (present-day Heekin Park), at the extreme
                    southeastern corner of the city. The building had been erected for a hotel (Wise Hotel) and had
                    fifteen large rooms. The authorities decided that as soon as new cases of smallpox developed, the
                    patients would be promptly removed to the hospital where they could be cared for properly. Such a
                    facility would also reduce the possibility of spreading the disease; as soon as the diseased person
                    was discovered, he or she would be removed to the hospital, and the residence would be thoroughly
                        disinfected.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Besides giving the patients better care and reducing the
                    possibility of spreading the disease, another advantage of the hospital was that it reduced the
                    necessary number of guards. Before the council decided to transfer smallpox victims to a hospital,
                    the city was employing as many as 150 to guard infected houses, which was an enormous expense.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although guards were no longer needed, the city had to employ nurses at the hospital as well as
                    doctors, disinfectors, and cooks. Father William Schmidt of St. Lawrence Catholic Church, for
                    instance, contacted the Sisters of Charity in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> and arranged for two nuns to be sent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> where they could minister as nurses in the hospital. Both had considerable experience
                    working with smallpox patients and would prove to be of tremendous assistance.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because the city council had anticipated that some people might not willingly or easily go to the
                    hospital, it passed an ordinance directing authorized personnel to remove all smallpox patients to
                    the hospital and empowering such officials to "use all necessary means, including force and
                    the breaking of doors if required, to compel the removal of all persons having smallpox."

                    the community and a belief among lawyers that the ordinance was probably unconstitutional. As a
                    result, no public official would issue a warrant for such forced entrance, and police refused to
                    make forcible entrance without a warrant; in short, once smallpox was believed to be in a home,
                    health authorities could not compel a family to submit to an inspection of their premises. As it
                    turned out, health officials in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> seemed less concerned about a family's rights than about preventing the spread

                    physicians sometimes took the law into their own hands and forced their way into the home as if
                    martial law were in effect.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>Later <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> commented about the problems associated with persuading patients to leave the comforts
                    of their home for the hospital. "Of all the difficult and arduous labor time, none was so
                    difficult or arduous as this," the health officer wrote, claiming that he had spent many
                    hours, as many as eight in one situation, in rooms loaded with pestilence and stench trying to
                    convince patients to go to the hospital. If health officers were unsuccessful, friends of patients
                    were sent to influence the family. One friend, who went kindly to reason with a family, told members
                    how they would get along much better at a hospital. The family responded by throwing rocks at the
                    friend until he was finally forced away. Sometimes drivers went five or six times to pick up a
                    patient only to be met with stubborn resistance, occasionally even with a shotgun's muzzle.
                    In one instance, an irate father fired his gun and wounded a man who had come to take his diseased
                    child to the hospital. In another situation a family with several infected members repeatedly
                    refused to allow any of the family to be removed to the hospital. Eventually health authorities
                    decided to starve out the family in order to force them to go to the hospital (although would-be
                    friends slipped in provisions anyway). Despite these trials, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> maintained that all but one patient who was supposed to go to a hospital eventually
                    went, although the delay in removing those in some homes caused others in the family to contract the
                    disease and continuing the spread of the epidemic. In the one unsuccessful case, health officers
                    were met at the door by a young man with a shotgun and told they would not be allowed to remove his
                    father. Although the officials pleaded with the young man, they were unable to change his mind, and
                    the middle-aged father was not removed from the home until he died a few days later.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    public meetings to convince the public that smallpox patients should be taken to the hospital.
                    Significant in changing the public's opinion was the action of Frances L. Budd, wife of a
                    prominent dentist in the city. She came to the health officer, reported that her twelve-year-old son
                    had smallpox, and specifically requested that he be taken to the hospital. Her action was followed
                    by other citizens, and afterward it was much easier to secure the consent of patients and relatives.
                    In order to induce patients to go, permission had previously been given for members of the family to
                    go with the patient and see that proper care and attention were given, but as people gained
                    confidence in the treatment their loved ones would receive in the hospital, fewer and fewer family
                    members felt it necessary to accompany the patient to the hospital.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>As the epidemic continued to spread, however, officials soon realized that one hospital could not
                    hold all the smallpox patients. As a result, the city council was persuaded to construct a second
                    hospital. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> Land Company donated some land four blocks southeast of the first hospital and just
                    south of the crossing of Ohmer (Memorial Drive) and <placeName>
                        <country reg="xn">Macedonia</country>
                    </placeName> Avenue. Working rapidly, contractor D. C. Mitchell completed a structure 118 feet long
                    and 18 feet wide before the end of September. Divided into a women's wing, men's
                    wing, dining room, kitchen, and office, the new hospital had a capacity of approximately forty
                    patients. The first hospital could house twenty-four and was at capacity by the time the second
                    building was completed. Soon after, city officials abolished domiciliary quarantine, and by October
                    8 all infected patients were removed to one of the hospitals.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The decision to place all patients in hospitals was certainly wise; domiciliary quarantine simply had
                    proven ineffective. The disease was in a thickly settled area in which the majority of the people
                    were either indifferent to the seriousness of the disease or were strongly opposed to vaccination.
                    To defy the authorities, some quarantined people took bundles of rags from infested homes and threw
                    them into backyards of other homes, thus spreading the disease. In many cases residents refused to
                    be vaccinated or lied to health officials about the presence of smallpox in their homes. Months
                    later, Cowing expressed the feeling of most health officials when he concluded that "house
                    quarantine was an utter failure."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    told that the disease could be acquired only by direct contact with persons who had smallpox or by
                    contact with articles touched by those who were sick, hence the importance of avoiding crowds or the
                    infected section of the city. State board of health secretary Metcalf was quoted in a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspaper saying that a person could safely go into an infected house as long as one
                    did not touch the body, clothing, or bedding of the diseased person. On the other hand <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents could read that the disease could be transferred by air and not strictly by
                    touch. An unidentified local physician emphasized the point in a letter to a newspaper in which he
                    claimed that one could get the disease by merely breathing the air near a smallpox patient. He
                    further claimed that the air could retain the germs for years if conditions were right. Residents
                    naturally wondered that if the only way one could contract the disease was by direct contact, then
                    why all the precautions in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>? If a person had never visited the infested district and had not been in the presence
                    of anyone who had, why must one's luggage be disinfected? Why fumigate the mail of such a
                    person? Despite whatever information one believed about the spread of the disease, those outside the
                    infected area were always strongly opposed to people who had spent considerable time in the diseased
                    district coming "uptown." No matter how thoroughly those living in the
                    southeastern part of town were disinfected, many of the citizens expressed strong alarm at a trip
                    out of the infested area.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not only were people confused about how the disease was spread, they were also perplexed by the
                    existence of differing schools of physicians. In Indiana the four schools having the largest number
                    of practitioners were homeopathic, eclectic, physiomedical, and allopathic (regulars). <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> had all four of these schools represented among its physicians. All of these people
                    were considered physicians, and each school had its own medical colleges, although curriculum and
                    academic standards varied widely. Concern among the citizens of Indiana that some physicians were
                    not properly trained led the state general assembly in 1885 to make it unlawful for any person to
                    practice medicine in the state without obtaining a license. But the license was granted simply upon
                    presentation of a diploma from a "reputable" medical school or upon proof of the
                    candidates' having practiced medicine in the state for a certain period of time: ten years
                    for those with no special education, three years for those with one full course of medical
                        lectures.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    </placeName> physicians, particularly those affiliated with the Indiana Anti-Vaccination Society,

                    all belonged to the society. None of these men was a regular (allopathic) physician, and all
                    maintained that vaccination was not only worthless but potentially dangerous. The way to reduce
                    smallpox, members claimed, was not by vaccination but by better urban sanitation. Obviously these
                    doctors refused to give their patients vaccinations during the epidemic. However, sometimes they
                    would issue their patients a certificate of health verifying that they had been vaccinated when in
                    reality they had not. As a result, city officials eventually rejected all certificates of

            <p>When the local school board decided that no child would be allowed to enter school without a proper

                    their schools. The Anti-Vaccination Society then asked for a court order restraining the school
                    authorities from such action, maintaining that medical compulsion, like religious compulsion, was
                    un-American. Although the case was not decided until the next year, a <placeName>

                    proper and needed precaution, and hence were able to convince city officials that the populace
                    should be inoculated. As a result approximately 10,000 residents out of a total population of 22,000

            <p>Along with homeopaths, eclectics made up the two principal medical sects in America during the late
                    nineteenth century. Doctors in the eclectic school did not use the powerful mineral remedies of the
                    day but relied instead on the use of plants and herbs for their remedies, though as their name
                    implies they professed to take the best from various schools. They carried on a vigorous campaign
                    against what they claimed was the excessive drugging and bleeding done by the regular profession.
                    Although graduates of eclectic schools (there were nine in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    their reliance on plants. Others called them quacks, but many Americans liked the fact that these
                    doctors used "natural" remedies and thus seemed close to nature.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bunch was not only a graduate of one of these eclectic schools, he was also active in both the state
                    and national eclectic societies. In fact, at one time he had been president of the state group in
                    Indiana. He was also one of ten eclectic physicians in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Delaware County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1893: five in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and one in Gas-ton. In comparison, there were forty-seven regular doctors, eight
                    homeopaths, and eight physio-medicals living in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Delaware County</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>Regular physicians such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Cowing, and Leech had little regard for eclectics. For one thing, none of the
                    eclectics practicing in the city aided the medical efforts to eradicate smallpox. Some of the
                    homeopaths and physio-medicals did help, especially Dr. John Quick, a physio-medical practitioner.
                    Then, too, eclectics regarded themselves as medical reformers dedicated to correcting problems
                    created by others in the medical profession. That attitude certainly did not endear them to the
                    regular physicians. Finally, the social class of eclectics was usually low, certainly lower than
                    that of regular physicians or homeopaths. One reason for this low social status, although surely not
                    the only reason, was that their patients came almost exclusively from the working classes. The most
                    popular of the eclectics in <placeName>

                    man's friend. But Bunch's large practice and nickname did not impress Cowing.

            <p>There also were the "infallible" remedies for smallpox that appeared in the
                    newspapers. One never-failing treatment that was said to have cured thousands called for one ounce
                    of cream of tartar dissolved in a pint of boiling water. This concoction was to be drunk at various
                    intervals during the day, after which the patient would be completely well in three days. But the
                    claims of this cure were mild in comparison to a more widely touted one, which purportedly had been
                    used for thirty years and had cured all but one case of smallpox. The treatment called for one grain
                    of sulphate of zinc plus one grain of foxglove (digitalis) mixed together with half a teaspoon of
                    water, to which four ounces of water were added. One was to take one teaspoon every hour. According
                    to one practitioner, this medicine would cure the disease in only twelve hours. Although such
                    remedies appeared frequently in the local papers, there is no indication that any sizable number of
                    people relied on them for a cure.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>Fear gripped Daleville when an elderly gentleman named McAlister, while slightly intoxicated,
                    confessed that there was a boy from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> visiting his home who was "all broke out." Although
                    McAlister's home was a mile and a half east of town, the Daleville community begged for a
                    doctor to examine the boy. Dr. G. W. H. Kemper from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

                    observed that the town was wildly excited and frightened. It took Kemper a while to locate the lad,
                    for the youngster was fishing. When Kemper finally found the boy, the doctor had to admit that the
                    young fellow was certainly broken out but not from smallpox. The boy had gotten into some poison ivy

            <p>In late September Anderson believed it had a case of smallpox. According to the Anderson <hi rend="i">Herald,</hi> about two weeks before, an Anderson man named Collier had handled some household
                    goods belonging to a family that was moving from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> family did not live near any of the infected houses in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Anderson paper obviously believed this furniture was the cause of the illness.
                    When it was learned that the furniture had been shipped out of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> just before the ruling went into effect requiring all such articles to be fumigated,
                    Anderson people were convinced that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> had given their city a case of the dreaded disease. As it turned out, Collier did not
                    have smallpox; but relations between the two cities were strained by the incident. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers claimed that Anderson mothers put their unruly children to sleep by

                    </placeName>, two such men who had recently been to <placeName>

                    </placeName> were arrested and placed under close guard because they did not have certificates of
                    health. Just the rumor that a person had been in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> was enough to get some traveling salesmen run out of town, as happened in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Prominence likewise mattered little. George Keiler, well-known <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> officials of his dilemma. Not until Cowing, who was well known in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, sent a telegram stating that Keiler was all right was the architect released.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although only thirty-three years old and in practice for little more than three years, Cowing took
                    his position as county health officer seriously. In an attempt to reduce the fear county residents
                    had of smallpox spreading to their communities, he frequently spoke to groups throughout the county
                    clarifying the situation in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, explaining the nature of the disease, and trying to prevent panic. One of his biggest
                    tasks was simply to refute rumors. According to Cowing, each day brought some sensational story to
                    be refuted. For instance, it was reported that dozens were dying daily in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, that the city clerk had issued only one burial permit, and that bodies were either
                    cremated at the garbage furnace or were sold.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the time the quarantine was issued on September 7, 1893, there were fifty-two cases of smallpox
                    and one death. The next ten days saw an additional fifty persons break out with the disease. Then
                    after the seventeenth of September a lull hit the area. New outbreaks of smallpox appeared, but they
                    were limited almost <list type="footnotes">

                    being controlled were shattered in early October, however, when a new wave hit the city. There were
                    two, three, or four new cases everyday as the disease crept from house to house in the infected
                    district. In some places every house in a row of five or six, one by one, became infected. By
                    October 5, there had been 133 instances of the disease reported. Mercifully, the situation then
                    improved. Perhaps it was simply that the disease had run its course, but more likely it was
                    immediate hospitalization that helped prevent its spread. From October 6 to 23 there were only eight
                    new smallpox patients. That number was reduced to six the last week in the month, and only one
                    additional person broke out with smallpox from November 1 to 9. Two other outbreaks in November and
                    December brought the total of smallpox cases in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> epidemic to 150.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>In 1876, the previous time smallpox had appeared in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, fifty people contracted the disease, and five died from it. This time there were
                    twenty-two deaths. The death angel seemed to play no favorites in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Thirteen males and nine females died. Fifteen of the victims were adults, ranging in
                    age from their early twenties to their seventies. In addition, three infant children, one girl of
                    nine, and three teenagers died. Of the twenty-two who failed to recover, seventeen had never been
                    vaccinated. Two of the victims had old vaccinations and three were vaccinated after the epidemic
                    began. To avoid spreading the disease, no public funerals were allowed for any of these victims, and
                    all were buried during the middle of the first night after their death, which avoided any public
                    gatherings and made possible the disposal of the infected bodies as soon as possible.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because fighting the epidemic cost the city thousands of dollars each week and brought it to within
                    two thousand dollars of its statutory limit of indebtedness, several citizens suggested that the
                    city attempt to persuade the state to reimburse some of the expenses. The state legislature, in
                    anticipation of an invasion of cholera, had made an appropriation of $50,000 for the
                    "purpose of preventing the introduction and spread of cholera and other infectious diseases
                    within the state." Since much of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s cost was in trying to keep the disease from spreading, the health officials

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> officials were making "a big thing" out of the epidemic. They claimed
                    that if money were appropriated those in charge would prolong the disease in order to make as much
                    as possible out of it. The governor also received letters from some <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> physicians still maintaining that the city merely had chicken pox, and not smallpox.
                    Those letters, Matthews believed, were caused by rivalry among schools of medicine in the city. Even
                    Dr. S. S. Boots, president of the Indiana State Board of Health, recommended that the fund not be
                    used to aid <placeName>

                    </placeName>, although his reasons were quite different. He stated in his recommendation to the
                    governor that smallpox in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> was now under control and that there was no threat of its spreading over the state.
                    Furthermore, he said that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>But the majority of the members of the state board of health differed with their president and

                    the majority of the board and announced on October 5 that the epidemic fund would be used to help

                    churches had not held religious services for seven weeks. Schools had not yet opened for the
                    1893–1894 school year, delayed by more than a month. The autumn opening of the Opera
                    House had been postponed more than once. Residents who traveled outside the city were weary of the
                    problems in getting all luggage fumigated and holding onto health certificates. Naturally business
                    in the city was dangerously low, and businessmen were eager to see the hinterland trade once again

                    </placeName> and announced on Saturday afternoon, November 4, that the quarantine was lifted. Public
                    gatherings such as church services would thus be allowed. Schools could open on Monday, and travel
                    outside the city no longer required certificates of health or fumigation of luggage. There was some
                    celebration that evening as about five thousand people congregated in the streets blowing horns and
                    ringing bells. Yet most did not celebrate. The epidemic had been terrible and the deaths saddening;
                    people were happy to have the bad times behind them but felt no sense of celebration, just
                        relief.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Months after the epidemic ended, several doctors wrote what they believed had been learned from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> experience. They overwhelmingly agreed that vaccination, isolation, and disinfection
                    were the three important factors in stamping out the disease. They learned that in some cases
                    immunity was not acquired after one vaccination; certain people required a second or even a third
                    shot. They also noted that vaccination, even though it did not always give absolute immunity, did
                    lessen the liability of attack, the severity of the disease, and the possibility of death.
                    Furthermore, all the physicians stressed that domiciliary quarantine was ineffective in preventing
                    the spread of the disease. As a rule, they believed that a hospital with a faithful medical staff
                    offered better conditions for recovery than did a patient's home. They also pointed out
                    that by early removal of patients from their home to a hospital, the danger of infecting others was
                    greatly diminished. Once a patient was removed to a hospital, the doctors agreed that a thorough
                    disinfection of the house was extremely important to prevent the disease's spread.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

                    </placeName>. Health officials were particularly hard pressed. They worked long hours everyday and
                    yet met with opposition all along the way. Quarantine precautions were frequently ignored. Many
                    persons refused to be vaccinated. Several physicians denied the existence of the disease, and public
                    criticism of the way the epidemic was handled was not infrequent. Economically the city was hard
                    hit; the depression of 1893 had adversely affected <placeName>

                    recover, the epidemic virtually cut off all trade with people living outside the city.</p>

                    patients had been quickly removed to that hospital. The delay in opening the hospital was
                    unfortunate but understandable.</p>
            <p>Yet in the end, the system worked. Despite resistance from some, thousands of residents were
                    vaccinated. After the initial delay, city officials were concerned enough to make tough
                    community-wide regulations and to enforce them despite some popular opposition. School officials
                    also held fast that only vaccinated children could come to school. Hospitals restored most victims
                    to health and reduced the spread of the disease. As bad as the epidemic was, it would have been much

            </byline>
            <p>The account that follows is the story of life in the Old Northwest Territory during the frontier
                    period as recollected by the narrator, John Wilkinson. It is not a tale of heroics, but rather the
                    story of a man facing life's requirements and carrying them out in an honest and honorable
                    manner. That it took place at a time and in a land that was evolving from a wilderness into a
                    settled agricultural expanse makes it pertinent to the history of the Northwest Territory and the
                    resulting states.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wilkinson and Ruth Ratcliff, the parents of John, had arrived with their families in
                    southeastern Ohio in the fall of 1804, the year following <placeName>

                    teens as the wagon trains slowly moved from the Piedmont area of <placeName>

                    West Virginia to the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. Here they floated their wagons and other
                    possessions over into the newly formed first state of the Northwest Territory. Both children lost
                    their mothers soon afterward, perhaps due to the rigors of the journey. On the frontier, where
                    neighbors were rare, proximity and similar backgrounds brought about their marriage, August 30,
                    1810, in the area then controlled by Ross County. John was the second in their family of eight
                    children that grew to adulthood: Hiram, John, Seth, Amy, Harriet, Maria, William, and Margaret.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>During John Wilkinson's lifetime the axe was replacing the rifle and would be replaced by
                    the plow. In this half century peoples spread like a tide from the Appalachian Mountains to the
                    Pacific Ocean. The Wilkinson family was one of the numerous upland southern groups that helped
                    people the Midwest after the Revolutionary War—the pioneering type that moved onward at
                    each generation, leapfrogging settled areas for the newly opened public lands toward the west. Every
                    twenty years or so, all or a portion of the family loaded the wagons and set out.</p>
            <p>The Wilkinson family was like many others on the frontier. Indeed, its travels and John's
                    particular activities had a certain parallel to Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s family and his early years. Both families moved by generation from the
                    southern highlands to Indiana, then to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, driving oxen teams and building log cabins as the need arose. John's sortie
                    into northern Illinois and his flat-boat trip down to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> followed by a year or two <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s similar travels. Both were axmen and used this frontier tool for shelter and
                    income, splitting out rails and cordwood.</p>
            <p>John Wilkinson's travels and adventures as a youth and young man are those that many boys
                    today dream about and yearn for but never experience other than through reading. One can sense a
                    feeling of satisfaction and pride in the recount, even after a lapse of fifty years spent at
                    farming, carpentering, and rearing a large family. John was not a hero type, except possibly to his
                    younger brothers. He was a doer, however, and rode with opportunity whenever it came passing by, as
                    evidenced by his words, "having but little opertunity of going to schoole tho I could wread
                    and write so as to be wread." And so he could. His reminiscence not only makes interesting
                    reading, but also offers insight into life on the <placeName>

                    half of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>The original of this little history was written when John was not yet seventy years of age, seventeen
                    years before his death. The story ends the year his wife Mary Jane died, in 1875. After four years
                    of widowhood John married Anthrite Derrickson on August 13, 1879. He lived another twenty years with
                    his second wife and died April 1, 1899, at the age of eighty-seven, outliving all of his brothers
                    and sisters. He is buried in the Perjue or Riggs Cemetery a few miles from his Iowa home.</p>

                            logical sentence break, and seemingly indiscriminate underlining and dashes at ends of lines
                            were omitted—as were obviously unintentional repetitions. Underlining of numbers
                            and letters within a line of text, however, has been included. Illegible words or phrases
                            are indicated in brackets. John Wilkinson often attached the article "a"
                            to the following word, as in "asmall" and "anice." He
                            also placed his decimal point two spaces to the left in figures; thus, 5.00 denotes 500.</item>

                            this area was made at Bunkum, on the north side of the Iroquois River. Gurdon S. Hubbard
                            (1802–1886), who traded with the Indians for the American Fur Company, had
                            settled here with others in 1830, but four years later had sold out, given his wife away,

                            the first county seat of Iroquois. Later the county offices were moved to Middleport, which
                            merged with South Middleport and became Watseka in about 1865. Watseka was the name of

                            operated the "Mansion House" for many years. He was one of the Cornishmen
                            who gravitated to the mining areas of <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                            </placeName>. His establishment was the larger of the two and took on the aspects of a
                            frontier tavern as well. In the 1836 census, Nichols was listed with forty-six persons while
                            John Hood was listed with only eight, perhaps indicating the relative sizes of their houses.
                            Thwaites, "The Territorial Census for 1836," 261, 263. John and Matilda
                            Hood and their oldest child were the first permanent settlers at Mineral Point. They came
                            from Missouri in the spring of 1828, possibly from the Old Lead Belt of southwestern
                            Missouri in St. Francois and <placeName>

                            </placeName> counties. At the time of John Wilkinson's arrival, Matilda was
                            operating one of the two hotels or "houses" in Mineral Point. She was the
                            first of her sex to preside over such an establishment in that area. Matilda was born
                            January 8, 1808, and so in the summer of 1834 she was just twenty-six years of age and only
                            a few years older than her young boarder. She and John Wilkinson apparently got on well. His
                            later reference to her as "my good old landlady," was in comradery rather
                            than in reference to age. Her husband eventually struck a lead vein and did well. He died in
                            1844, and in 1860 she was operating a prosperous dress shop as well as her boarding house.

            <p>A volume in the <hi rend="i">Midwestern History and Culture</hi> series, Ronald D. Cohen's
                    study of the Gary public schools and its famous founding father, William A. Wirt, is a carefully
                    researched and very useful study. Brought to Gary as its first school superintendent, Wirt went
                    about building a system that provided a reasonable fit for a heavily immigrant and industrial city.
                    This account of one of the nation's most exciting and famous educational
                    experiments—which was frequently emulated, then much criticized, and finally
                    dismantled—is a well-balanced and even-handed rendering.</p>
            <p>The Gary Plan began in 1910 and was part of the progressive educational reform movement that included
                    health exams, night school, "Americanization" programs, and greatly enriched
                    curricula of arts, crafts, manual, and intellectual training. Yet the heart of Wirt's plan
                    was the "platoon system," where elementary students no longer spent the entire day
                    in a single homeroom but changed classrooms for different subjects; one-half of the students would
                    be working in school and the other half would be on the playground. Thus the system could
                    accommodate double the number of students with little or no building and staff expansion. In
                    addition all students were sent at various hours en masse to the auditorium to hear speakers, which
                    also relieved overcrowding and cut educational costs. This work-study-play plan with its long
                    eight-hour day met the requirements of parents with flexible time, whereby a child could arrive
                    late, leave early for home chores, peddling papers, or music lessons.</p>
            <p>The "platoon" and Wirt became famous; visitors flooded into Gary, and the
                    celebrated superintendent was contracted to establish a similar system in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By 1929 more than 1,000 schools in 202 cities had adopted the Gary Plan, and Wirt had
                    become one of the most heralded pedagogues of his day. After his death in 1938, however, the system
                    fell increasingly into disfavor as educational philosophies changed and shifted. By the late 1950s
                    the Wirt system had been dismantled in Gary and replaced by "contained" elementary
                    classrooms where students spent most of the day.</p>

            <p>In an afterword, Cohen asks, "are the schools overall better or worse than they were thirty,
                    fifty, or seventy years ago?" He responds, "I would not venture a guess"
                    (p. 241). Cohen then proceeds to describe the pathologies afflicting schools that are
                    "overwhelmingly black, plagued with academic problems, occasionally violent, having an
                    essentially automatic promotion policy, and marked by sporadic academic, athletic, and social
                    successes" (p. 243). He wistfully concludes: "Perhaps a return to the old
                    work-study-play plan would make the elementary schools at least more interesting, if not actually
                    increasing the students' academic, cultural, and social skills. Perhaps" (p. 244).
                    This is a solid, worthwhile, and very readable study that places Gary's public schools and
                    its famous "platoon system" and founder into a meaningful and understandable
                    historic framework. Students of education, progressive, and urban history will want to read it.</p>

            <p>Ernie Pyle's place as the most admired American correspondent in World War II has been long
                    established. <hi rend="i">Ernie's America</hi> proves that the reporting style associated
                    with Pyle during the war already had surfaced in his work in the 1930s. From 1935 until the <placeName>

                    </placeName> entered the war, Pyle was a roving reporter who published a travel column six times a
                    week for the Scripps Howard papers. This volume is a selected collection of the dispatches that were
                    used in his column. The more one reads them, even today, the more one understands the
                    columns' popularity.</p>
            <p>Pyle sought subjects about ordinary life that would touch the curiosity of his mass readership and
                    found them most often in rural and small town America. In the latter years of the Great Depression
                    stories based on common folk had a distinctive pulling power in the American imagination. His
                    dispatches introduced readers to people and places throughout the country whose significance could
                    have been overlooked without his guidance. The stories blended geographical description and local
                    history and added dashes of local lore and folkways. They captured the idiom and detail of American
                    life, conveying in the process the hardships endured by Americans in the stringent years of the
                    1930s. Pyle's intimate, anecdotal, and nostalgic writing gave him strong personal appeal.
                    In part that appeal was the result of his interesting and informal descriptive style. He wrote in
                    such a way that it led his <pb n="[424]" id="VAA4025-086-4-084"/>

                    also due to the sense of discovery that was central to his dispatches. What remarkable person would
                    he find to write about in this town? What tale could be told of this hamlet? His popularity was also
                    the result of the way in which Pyle put himself into the column; he became a type of unpretentious
                    narrator who shared the language and thoughts of his middle-class readers. Among the personal things
                    he shared with readers were references to his own home and family. His dispatches made frequent
                    references to his boyhood on a farm outside Dana, Indiana, and his periodic visits back there to see
                    his family. Pyle seemed to have an intuitive grasp of what would interest his readers, and these
                    references to his own background and family strengthened the tie he had with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Ernie's America</hi> is a skillfully compiled volume. It is enhanced by David
                    Nichols's introduction, which ably introduces Pyle in a way that increases understanding of
                    the man and his work. Nichols should be commended for his astute explanation of Pyle's
                    skills of observation and narration and also for his sensitive treatment of the character flaws that
                    both Pyle and his wife Jerry endured during the years when the couple roamed about the country.
                    Ultimately, however, it is Pyle's dispatches that stand out in this volume. They remind
                    readers that the human interest factor in journalism need not be trite, sensational, or startling to
                    be successful.</p>

            <p>Since the first public flight by Wilbur Wright in 1908, the Wright brothers have not lacked for
                    biographers. <hi rend="i">The Bishop's Boys</hi> contributes a sympathetic personality
                    analysis of Wilbur and Orville Wright, as well as a fresh and very readable account of their roles
                    in the technological and social history of aviation.</p>
            <p>Author Tom D. Crouch contrasts the Wrights with other members of the international aeronautical
                    fraternity at the end of the nineteenth century. Although the Wrights readily acknowledged debts to
                    other aviators, their own advances stemmed from a more practical engineering approach. While other
                    experimenters studied birds, Wilbur Wright analyzed bicycle steering to determine the principles of
                    controlling an airplane in flight. As successful bicycle manufacturers, Wilbur and Orville easily
                    overcame the problems of construction and power that so preoccupied their peers.</p>
            <pb n="426" id="VAA4025-086-4-086"/>
            <p>The technological history that is at the core of this book is enriched by the author's work
                    with artifactual evidence, including the pair's primitive wind tunnel, flying reproductions
                    of their early gliders and first airplane, and careful study of Orville Wright's own
                    recreations of his early airplanes. Crouch, affiliated with the National Museum of American History,
                    provides a fascinating aside on the provenance of an American icon, the Wright airplane exhibited at
                    the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Bishop's Boys</hi> is most successful when looking at Orville and Wilbur
                    not just as aviation pioneers but also as people. Crouch productively mines their personal papers,
                    as well as an unpublished study by a clinical psychologist on the Wright family. <placeName>

                    </placeName> Wright, the patriarch of the family and a United Brethren bishop, provided a powerful

                    </placeName>'s experiences in schismatic church politics were reflected in the extended
                    patent litigation that interrupted the Wright brothers' flying careers. Crouch also
                    provides new insight into how the sibling relationship between Wilbur and Orville molded their
                    working relationship.</p>

               </placeName>, provided a haven for the brothers
                    throughout their lives. <hi rend="i">The Bishop's Boys</hi> presents the Wright brothers in

                    enigmatic figures, Crouch tells a much simpler but richer story of the two ordinary, unassuming
                    midwesterners who taught human beings to fly.</p>

            <p>Using images of the Midwest from popular magazines from 1820 to the present, James R. Shortridge
                    explains not only where the Midwest is but also what composes it. Shortridge surprisingly discovered
                    that originally the concept Midwest was not a mediation between East and West, but between Northwest
                    and Southwest. The term originated in the 1880s and at first included only Kansas and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>. By 1912, however, the term had shifted to the more common definition of the states of
                    the Northwest Territory (<placeName>

               </placeName>, and, finally, the
                    original Midwest states of Nebraska and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. Booth Tarkington of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was critical <pb n="427" id="VAA4025-086-4-087"/> in enlarging the locational
                    definition of the Midwest, arguing that this twelve-state area mediated between the old industrial
                    East and the youthful West. The Midwest, he maintained, was pastoral, mature, and the quintessence
                    of things American because its people were more native-born and egalitarian than in eastern cities.</p>
            <p>The apogee of the positive image of the Midwest occurred by 1920, but thereafter it quickly declined
                    and reached its nadir by 1950. According to Shortridge, two events caused the decline of the image
                    of the Midwest: the publication of <hi rend="i">Main Street</hi> by Sinclair Lewis and the
                    agricultural depression of the 1920s. Lewis depicted the Midwest as conformist and materialistic,
                    while the depression revealed the economic weakness of farmers. These attitudes were not overcome
                    until the 1960s, when negative views of American cities (associated more with the East and West
                    despite the large Midwest cities of the Great Lakes) made the Midwest (rural in image if not in
                    fact) more attractive. Interestingly, the nostalgia for the Midwest shifted its geographical center
                    back to Kansas and Nebraska because they were mostly rural. In addition, many added Oklahoma to the
                    Midwest and excluded <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, at least as based on Shortridge's study of the mental maps of American
                    college students. Indiana remained part of the Midwest, although its southern half was considered to
                    be on the fringe because of its Upland South culture. College students imagined the Midwest to be
                    rooted in place and genuine rather than superficial in personality, both part of the pastoral
                    tradition.</p>
            <p>Shortridge has created an intriguing overview of the history of the idea of the Midwest in American
                    culture. Perhaps he will stimulate more regional (rather than only state) study of the American
                    heartland. There is still need for a general history or historical geography of the Midwest that is
                    as broadly conceived as Shortridge's definition.</p>

            <p>William E. Foley's work on the early history of Missouri is an expanded version of the
                    volume he wrote in 1971 for the multi-volume <hi rend="i">Missouri Sesquicentennial History.</hi> As
                    the subtitle indicates, the book covers the period from the earliest French explorations <pb n="428" id="VAA4025-086-4-088"/> of the Missouri area in the late seventeenth century to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s admission to the union in 1820.</p>
            <p>When someone writes a second book on a topic, the obvious question is whether the new book is
                    substantially the same book as the first one, or whether significant new research and thinking have
                    made the latter book a different one. In this case, the answer depends on the part of the book being
                    considered. Most of the new work in this volume deals with the economy and society of early <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, especially during the French and Spanish periods. The author has done an excellent job
                    of incorporating recent research by social historians and anthropologists to present a richly
                    detailed picture of the lives of the French, Indians, blacks, and American settlers in the state.
                    His treatment of the commercial relations between the French traders and the Osage and other western
                    Indians is especially good, illuminating the Indian perspective as well as the French.</p>
            <p>The only weakness in the handling of the French period is the absence of any discussion of the
                    broader French community in the Upper Mississippi Valley. Because the French in Missouri maintained
                    extensive commercial and social ties with the settlements in Illinois and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, some discussion of this larger community would seem to have been in order even if it
                    meant going beyond the political boundaries of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the sections on Missouri social history, the sections on territorial politics,
                    occupying most of the latter half of the book, cover much the same ground as the 1971 book. In fact,
                    a substantial amount was taken straight from the earlier book with only minor additions and word
                    changes.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, this volume is clearly much more than just an updated edition of Foley's
                    earlier work, and it must be regarded as the starting point for anyone interested in the early
                    history of <placeName>

                    this area.</p>
            <p>Knepper's volume is the first significant single-volume history of the state to be produced
                    since James Rodabaugh updated Eugene Roseboom's and Francis P. Weisenburger's <hi rend="i">A History of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    need of something new. The book is, indeed, a most appropriate successor, not merely because it
                    fills such a great chronological void, but because it carries off its task with a good deal of
                    thought and style. The volume is extraordinarily readable, aided by its division into seventeen
                    chronological/topical chapters and by the use within those chapters of numerous thematic
                    subsections. These subsections are used to great interpretive advantage. For example, Knepper deals
                    with four of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s nineteenth-century "contributions" to the American
                    presidency in a single section. The comparative discussion of R#2 B. Hayes, James A. Garfield,
                    William Henry Harrison, and William McKinley is tightly written and rich in analysis. What could
                    have been a long, tedious narrative history is avoided by devices such as these and by the
                    author's excellent prose.</p>
            <p>The cohesion and readability of the book are matched, in part, by its inclusivity. <hi rend="i">Ohio
                        and Its People</hi> deals with a variety of issues ranging from the economic conditions of the
                    frontier state to the impact of sports and leisure activities in the late twentieth century. <pb n="431" id="VAA4025-086-4-091"/> True to its title, the volume does deal with the people of the
                    state, providing information on everyone from Native Americans to the migrants and immigrants in the
                    state's major cities. In a state comprised of farms and factories, and urban Democrats and
                    rural Republicans, it is not easy to be inclusive, but Knepper nevertheless manages to handle
                    adeptly a number of diverse issues.</p>
            <p>It is, however, the balance in dealing with these issues that causes problems. Urban historians may
                    be pleased that the volume discusses a variety of "city" issues but will be
                    troubled because more attention seems to be devoted to exploration, early settlement, and frontier
                    life. Over half (263 pages) of the volume covers the state's history to the end of the
                    Civil War while the era of great urban growth receives less attention. Telescoping the enormous
                    economic changes and demographic variety of post—Civil War Ohio into so little space
                    creates problems. Consequently, readers will find the longer discussions of frontier life and
                    military campaigns more satisfying than the more "packed" discussions of
                    twentieth-century urban migrants and immigrants (treated in a quick four-page section).</p>
            <p>This, however, is a minor caveat, and the excellent selective bibliography can be used to uncover
                    additional details about any subject treated in the volume. Moreover, the style and structure of the
                    book override any perceived imbalance and "Knepper" justly deserves its quickly
                    acquired position as the state's new history.</p>

                    </placeName>, has long awaited its historian. Barbara E. Benson has pieced together the story of its
                    early growth from the pioneer days until 1870, by which time it had become the leading lumber
                    manufacturing center in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Focusing on the three stages of activity—logging, milling, and
                    marketing—she also looks at the resource base, initial settlement, work force, and lumber
                    entrepreneurs. Using a variety of primary sources, including family and business papers, manuscript
                    and printed census records, credit rating reports and newspapers, and local and lumber history
                    monographs and articles along with those colorful biographical and county histories written <pb n="432" id="VAA4025-086-4-092"/> in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, she has
                    produced a thoughtful study.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Logs and Lumber</hi> is basically frontier history, but because its subject matter is
                    industrial, it is difficult to find a suitable framework of analysis. Adopting the institutional
                    interpretation of "merchants and manufacturers," the activities of loggers and
                    lumbermen are viewed as responses to an imperfect market. In an era of abundant resources, low cost
                    of entry, seasonal working activities, dependence on water transportation, and a growing local
                    population, men who processed low-value bulky lumber operated under uncertain conditions. Small
                    millmen either remained content to sell locally or went in and out of business according to economic
                    fluctuations. Larger scale entrepreneurs attempted to integrate backwards and forwards acquiring
                    land, contracting with loggers, installing improved technology, introducing steam power, and
                    developing marketing strategies. Small and large co-existed. There was no single firm or group
                    dominating production, though the commercial lumber industry as a whole dominated the economy of the
                    Wolverine state.</p>
            <p>The overall pattern is clear, but the details are often incomplete or tentative. Benson is correct to
                    hedge many of her quantitative statements, knowing that the information is not robust enough for
                    sophisticated analysis, but she will leave her readers less satisfied than did her earlier
                    counterparts, Agnes Larson and Robert Fries, who wrote on the Minnesota and Wisconsin pine
                    industries in 1949 and 1951 respectively. It is a pity that the theoretical and methodological
                    outpourings of the "second social science revolution" have weakened the statements
                    of well-researched midwestern monographs. It is also a pity that this enterprising study has been
                    shortchanged in its editorial process. The absence of an index, titles to illustrations, and full
                    headings or footings on some tables detracts from the quality and perseverence of the research.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Border Diplomacy</hi> is a carefully detailed and documented analysis of the <hi rend="i">Caroline</hi> affair and the ensuing problems that led the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and British to the brink of war in the early 1840s. Kenneth R. Stevens has followed the
                    complicated chronology with explicit care for each and every occurrence, carefully outlining <pb n="433" id="VAA4025-086-4-093"/> the manner in which states' rights arguments
                    complicated foreign relations during the 1830–1860 period. The book is also thorough in
                    describing the effect of Anglo-American disagreements upon the affairs of other major nations.
                    Stevens clearly indicates why the king of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> was concerned and the czar of Russia offered to mediate the McLeod affair (p. 99).</p>
            <p>Where the work falls short is in presenting the Canadian perspective as different from either the
                    British or American. Even though <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> did not assume Dominion status until 1867, Canadians were developing unique views
                    during the early nineteenth century. Stevens's statement that "The <hi rend="i">Caroline</hi> affair had been an affront to honor that rankled even peace-loving Americans, and
                    official British unconcern compounded the situation" (p. 156), entirely ignores the
                    well-founded Canadian fear that the affair would be settled by an American demand for grants (from
                    Britain) of Canadian land.</p>
            <p>Another unfortunate omission is the background in British North America that preceded the 1837
                    rebellions. Although Stevens correctly indicates uprisings in both Upper and Lower <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, he neglects to explain why there was little popular support for either movement. There
                    is no mention of Louis-Joseph Papineau, who led the movement in Lower <placeName>

                    from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863. Indiana soldiers fought in every significant encounter,

                    to contingencies, but the key to the tactical draw and Confederate retreat lies with the mistakes of
                    Bragg. Emphasizing dissension in Bragg's high command, Cozzens suggests that enmity was so
                    great between Bragg and General John C. Breckinridge that Breckinridge delayed sending his men into
                    battle, fearing that Bragg would mishandle them.</p>
            <p>Much of the writing is colorful, and through published memoirs and unit histories the action comes
                    alive. At times, however, vitality fades and regiments move with the inanity of pieces on a game
                    board. Moreover, several errors slipped by the editors. For example, Colonel Thomas H. Hunt,
                    commander of the 9th Kentucky Infantry, is identified as Robert Hunt, and Colonel William H. Gibson
                    first appears as commander of the 39th Indiana Infantry, and later, correctly, as head of the 49th <placeName>

            <p>Ever since its publication in 1956 Dudley Taylor Cornish's <hi rend="i">The Sable Arm: Negro
                        Troops in the Union Army, 1861–1865</hi> has rightly held the position of the classic
                    study of its subject owing to its solid research, splendid literary style, and balanced and
                    perceptive analyses. Joseph T. Glatthaar's <hi rend="i">Forged in Battle: The Civil War
                        Alliance of Black Soldiers and White Officers,</hi> although covering much of the same ground,
                    does not supplant it; it merely supplements it, in three main ways. First, it utilizes a large
                    number of primary and secondary sources that either were unavailable when Cornish did his research
                    or were impracticable to obtain prior to the existence of photocopying machines. Second, unlike
                    Cornish's work, which stops with the end of the Civil War, Glatthaar's <pb n="435" id="VAA4025-086-4-095"/> volume carries its story into the post-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName> years, dealing with the role of black troops in Reconstruction and with what befell
                    them after returning to civilian life. Third, as the title of his book indicates, Glatthaar focuses
                    on a subject that Cornish treated but not at great length, namely the personal interactions between
                    black enlisted men and predominantly white officers of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Colored Troops (USCT). It is his thesis that despite the barriers of race, cultural
                    differences, rank, and above all white ignorance and prejudice regarding blacks, on the whole these
                    interactions were able to develop into a relationship that contributed to victory in the war and
                    pointed the way, at least for awhile, to the achievement of victory over white racism in peacetime
                    as well.</p>
            <p>Probably Glatthaar exaggerates the positive aspects of this relationship; to his credit, he himself
                    provides abundant evidence of the negative side. Also, because he must deal with a large and diverse
                    group of men under circumstances varying with time and place, his generalizations inevitably require
                    frequent qualifications, with the result that he has to make considerable use of such phrases as
                    "on the other hand," "however," "to be sure,"
                    etc.—and this in turn results in some rather tedious passages. Finally, although he
                    displays a sound factual grasp of his topic as such, Glatthaar tends to be a little shaky in his
                    knowledge of the Civil War era in general, as for example in referring to the scrawny James H. Lane
                    of Kansas as "Big Jim" (pp. 7, 122) and asserting that dynamite, which was not
                    invented until 1867, was used to blow up a Confederate fort in 1864 (p. 150)! But these are
                    negligible defects in the overall context of his book, which is a worthy successor to his fine first
                    work, <hi rend="i">The March to the Sea and Beyond: Sherman's Troops in the Savannah and
                        Carolinas Campaigns</hi> (1985), and which deserves to be placed on the shelf beside

                        1890–1930.</hi> By James C. Juhnke. (Scottdale, Pa.: Herald Press, 1989. Pp. 394.

            <p>Midwestern street wisdom understands Mennonites to be a body of quiet, Protestant Christians, rather
                    like Baptists but with a closer group unity. They are considered low in profile among the
                    denominations but high in performance in the work of missions, peacemaking, and service to the needy
                    on a worldwide scale.</p>
            <pb n="436" id="VAA4025-086-4-096"/>
            <p>At the same level of street wisdom, the Amish are generally understood as akin to Mennonites but much
                    more "strict." They conduct church meetings in their homes. They retain ancient
                    language, worship ways, hairstyles, and clothing fashions. They reject a great many practices and
                    conveniences of the contemporary world.</p>
            <p>This book certainly expands such popular conceptions. "Men-nonite" is most useful
                    as a broad term that includes the Amish. Both terms have been used and variously combined to apply
                    to scores of American Mennonite fellowships. Perhaps no body of Christians of comparable size has
                    been so fragmented. There are Amish in Indiana who have church buildings and Sunday schools, operate
                    tractors and automobiles, and equip their homes with electrical appliances. There are Mennonites in
                    Indiana who wear long beards and black clothes and travel by horse and buggy. There are Conservative
                    Amish Mennonites known for their liberalism because most of their sermons are in English and few of
                    their young men wear beards.</p>
            <p>Such diversity makes all the more remarkable the goal of this <hi rend="i">Mennonite Experience in
                        America</hi> series. A group of historians has undertaken to "synthesize the historical
                    experience of the various Mennonite groups in America," assuming that a discernible unity
                    exists and that they can describe it with "disciplined integrity" (pp. 2, 14).
                    This study of the years 1890–1930 is the third of four projected volumes in the series.</p>
            <p>In the first 135 pages James C. Juhnke offers a picture of the whole varied Mennonite family in
                    America. Mennonitism in this period was, he says, a "bipolar mosaic" (p. 105). At
                    one pole were the Swiss and south <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> Mennonites so familiar to historians in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <country reg="ohu">Ohio</country>
               </placeName>, and Indiana. At the
                    other pole were the Russian Mennonites of Dutch background who generally came to America later and
                    settled farther west. Within each polar area there were hosts of individual Mennonite units.</p>
            <p>Mennonites had found their unity in Europe by standing against Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, or
                    Reformed church establishments. In America, where there was no religious establishment, every
                    individual segment of the Mennonite bipolar mosaic had to define its own contour in a context of
                    revivalism, fundamentalism, denominationalism, and the excitement of modern technology. Some became
                    progressives, adopting English, Sunday schools, revivals, denominational structures, publishing
                    houses, mission agencies, colleges, and much of American culture. The "old orders"
                    rejected progressivism. Juhnke treats the "yieldedness" and
                    "humility" of these old orders with great respect. Most Mennonites adopted some
                    middle ground of cautious and controlled change.</p>
            <p>Though he records many ironies in the development of American Mennonites during these decades, Juhnke
                    sees a persistent <pb n="437" id="VAA4025-086-4-097"/> unity. Mennonites did not lose their
                    identity, he says, but maintained a "peoplehood" based on the Bible, on the
                    example of the apostolic church, and on the radical Anabaptist vision of the sixteenth century. The
                    abuse of Mennonite conscientious objectors during World War I heightened their consciousness as a
                    nonresistant people. Mennonitism is a marvelous mosaic, he says, but all its parts taken together
                    produce a family likeness which is plain.</p>

            <p>Historians of modern America have devoted relatively little attention to groups and movements that
                    have attempted to promote right-wing causes, conservative ideals, or "traditional
                    values." Workers, women, ethnic minorities, political and intellectual radicals, and the
                    poor—at one time or another all victims of persecution at the hands of forces defending
                    the status quo—understandably have elicited more sympathy and attention. Those works that
                    have dealt with conservative and right-wing groups have generally focused on well-known leaders,
                    their ideas, and the cultural climate in which they gained influence. The social histories of
                    conservative and right-wing movements in twentieth-century America, therefore, remain largely
                    unwritten, and questions about the reasons for their movements' continued popularity have
                    been left without reliable answers.</p>
            <p>William Pencak's <hi rend="i">For God &amp; Country: The American Legion,
                        1919–1941</hi> joins a small group of recent books by K. Austin Kerr, Lynn Dumenil,
                    and Robert Alan Goldberg which has begun to address this problem. Although the American Legion was
                    born in the era of the Red Scare and became well-known for its super-patriotic obsession with
                    communism, Pencak asserts that the Legion's popularity in the interwar years cannot be
                    explained simply by reactionary antiradicalism. The book's general theme is that the
                    Legion's main purpose was to promote "the belief that personal freedom requires
                    responsibility to a community defined both morally and historically" (p. 5). Pencak
                    explains in great detail how the Legion's devotion to this idea led, during the Red Scare
                    in particular, to a rabid, sometimes violent fixation on the International Workers of the World and
                    other radical groups that challenged American institutions and threatened communal harmony in the
                    process. The same commitment to community, however, also led the Legion into campaigns on behalf of
                    the average citizen. First <pb n="[438]" id="VAA4025-086-4-098"/>

                    describes the important role the Legion played in promoting veterans' rights and benefits.
                    Yet the Legion also showed considerable support for mainstream labor unions and demonstrated some
                    willingness to stand behind nonwhite Protestant ethnic minorities who had joined its ranks. Pencak
                    also emphasizes the Legion's involvement in individual communities and its support for
                    activities and causes as well known as American Legion baseball and as wide-ranging as public
                    construction projects, emergency relief, conservation, and child welfare.</p>
            <p>The great strength of this book is its thorough use of the Legion's archives in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as well as the American Civil Liberties Union archives and other manuscript
                    collections. At the same time, however, this is also the book's great weakness. Given
                    Pencak's emphasis on community, one wishes he had gone beyond describing local events and
                    circumstances as they appeared in files at the national headquarters and made a more systematic
                    effort to explain the role that the Legion actually played in different communities. Had he combined
                    his general observations with a bit of local analysis, for example, Pencak might have been able to
                    describe more precisely than he does the social characteristics of Legion members and what
                    distinguished them from other veterans and other groups of citizens. He might have been able to
                    offer some explanation for the Legion's great popularity in Indiana. He might also have
                    been able to offer a more penetrating analysis of the competing interests and conflicts that seemed
                    to influence Legion activities, making members appear to support community business elites in some
                    instances (by attacking Wobblies in the lumber community of Centralia, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example) and making them oppose business leaders in other cases (as Minnesota
                    Legion members did in their campaign to protect wilderness areas from development).</p>

            <p>In these two recent volumes honoring the contributions of pioneer folklorist Warren E. Roberts to the
                    emergent fields of folklife and material culture, readers receive a tandem of works that nicely
                    frame Roberts's long and illustrious career. Roberts, a professor of folklore at Indiana
                    University, was the first student to receive a Ph.D. in folklore, but it was his intrigue with the
                    open-air museums of <placeName>
                        <country reg="no">Norway</country>
                    </placeName> and the products and methods of local craftsmen that took him from studying English
                    folktales to conducting fieldwork in southern Indiana. Along the way he injected fresh approaches to
                    the discipline of folklore and assisted in its development and maturation. The two books provide
                    both scholars and nonscholars with a well-intended "kick in the pants" to consider
                    and reconsider the overlooked.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Viewpoints</hi> Roberts lobbies ardently for "a truer picture of past
                    life" (p. 11) by very carefully setting up defenses for his tenets in the introduction and
                    highlighting their efficacy in the collection of essays that appear in the main text. The book
                    contains twenty chapters ranging on topics from folk arts, crafts, and tombstones to tools and
                    Scandinavian log construction. Each chapter considers a finite subject matter with infinite
                    applications and thereby reveals Roberts's dogma for studying folklife: by tirelessly
                    collecting data while keeping an eye toward the larger context one can piece together the puzzle.
                    Roberts is most successful when he adheres to this doctrine; this is particularly evident in his
                    chapters "Tools on Tombstones: Some Indiana Examples" and "Wood Screws as
                    an Aid in Dating Wooden Artifacts," both of which examine minute details in investigating
                    larger themes. Less convincing are his articles on textiles and Hoosier names, where the treatment
                    of these subjects is too brief; it should come as no surprise that his strengths lie in areas of
                    real interest to him. "Turpin Chairs and the Turpin Family: Chairmaking in Southern
                    Indiana" is no doubt this volume's best effort at studying folk art and craft from
                    a folklife perspective. Although originally (and regrettably) declined by this magazine, this 1981
                    article combines effective arguments for pursuing details, process, materials, and genealogy in
                    reconstructing local history: "When one thinks of the overall history of man and his
                    effects on the environment, it is clear that the furniture factories in Monroe and Greene Counties
                    represent a temporary phase, while the Turpins represent the really old, long lasting pattern (p.
                    120)." One can see in this article the benefits of comparing and contrasting the
                    exceptional with the ordinary and projecting from the smaller plane to the larger plane.
                    Roberts's important section on "Overlooked Aspects of Folk Architecture"
                    redoubles this effort by focusing on function and cultural context in the ancestry and construction
                    patterns of early southern Indiana architecture: Scandinavian log buildings and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-American log buildings. Roberts's unrealized dream of collecting log buildings
                        <pb n="441" id="VAA4025-086-4-101"/> and reconstructing a folk museum at Indiana University is a
                    lofty goal, but one that also raises questions about context, since their removal and relocation can
                    provide, at best, an artificially recreated context.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Old Traditional Way of Life</hi> offers a chronological and appropriate segue from
                    the previous volume to the current state of folklife studies. Roberts's goals in <hi rend="i">Viewpoints</hi> reach fruition in this <hi rend="i">festschrift</hi> by graduate
                    students and colleagues. His charges to "focus attention on the folk as they appear through
                    their products" (p. 10) are realized in twenty-five articles, ranging from
                    "Spindles and Spoon Racks" to "Grain Stacking in the Midwest"
                    and from "Summer Kitchens of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName>" to "Family Settlement Stories." And, similar to <hi rend="i">Viewpoints,</hi> this volume touches upon the same genres of folk art, folk
                    architecture, and folk narrative. In addition, arguments for the closer examination of regional and
                    occupational folklife are espoused in two excellent articles, "The Northern Lake Michigan
                    Fishing Skiff Tradition" by Janet C. Gilmore and "The River Houseboat in the Ohio
                    Valley" by Jens Lund.</p>
            <p>As a logical extension of <hi rend="i">Viewpoints,</hi> then, editors Robert E. Walls and George H.
                    Schoemaker call upon Roberts's peers to address specific topics relevant to current
                    folklife study. For example, Lynwood Montell considers southern burial customs as unifying group
                    activities, and Allen G. Nobel and Deborah Phillips King analyze the study of folk architecture from
                    a quantitative approach in an article on the disappearance rate of agricultural structures in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Linda D$eAgh's article, "The Ethnography of a Folktale,"
                    raises the question of whether or not "symbols underlying artistic formulations such as
                    folktales should be taken for granted when attempting the interpretation of the specific
                    formulations and variations of individual tales" (p. 346). Each of these contributions in
                        <hi rend="i">The Old Traditional Way of Life</hi> concentrates on one particular aspect of
                    folklife while simultaneously bearing out Roberts's dogma of joining fieldwork and context.</p>
            <p>The publication of these two volumes serves to notify the world of Warren Roberts's
                    achievements and to keep the studies of folk-life and material culture on course. And, just as
                    healthy disciplines are prone to do, the constant questioning and reshaping of theories and
                    movements will lead to a stronger, more vibrant field. It is fitting that Roberts lends his
                    expertise to this charge. It is equally fitting that his contributions are not overlooked.</p>

            <p>Leonard K. Eaton and John W. Reps are both senior scholars with distinguished careers: Eaton in the
                    history of architecture and landscaping and Reps in the history of planning. Now each has written a
                    book that reflects his personal interest in a narrow subject that probably will not attract a broad
                    readership. Eaton's <hi rend="i">Gateway Cities &amp; Other Essays</hi> primarily
                    expresses the author's appreciation of and fascination with warehouse architecture in
                    midwestern cities. Reps's <hi rend="i">Saint Louis Illustrated</hi> presents a series of
                    nineteenth-century views of the Missouri metropolis and describes the evolution of the art of city
                    depiction and those people who practiced that craft in Saint Louis. Each, then, examines a small
                    niche of history previously ignored by historians and demonstrates that in such overlooked recesses
                    one can discover insights into the past.</p>
            <p>A native of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, Eaton returns to the region of his youth to consider the looming commercial monuments
                    that clustered in the railroad hubs between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Examining
                    Saint Paul, Saint Joseph, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Omaha</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Winnipeg, he finds that they developed as major wholesaling centers in the late
                    nineteenth century, and the number of warehouses in each city testifies to the past prominence of
                    the jobbing trade. According to Eaton, the warehouses are architecturally the most distinguished
                    structures in these gateway cities, and he admiringly describes their structure and ornament as well
                    as the architects who designed them and the wholesalers who commissioned them. Moreover, he
                    periodically interjects a plea for preservation of the surviving warehouses.</p>
            <p>As its title indicates, Eaton's work is a collection of essays, some of which are only
                    loosely related to the others. For example, he includes a short discussion of a house and a store in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, each designed by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s John W. Root; at the end of the book he inserts an article relating George
                    Caleb Bingham's famed election series of paintings to Dutch genre works of the seventeenth
                    century. Because of this diversity of subjects, Eaton's collection lacks a satisfying
                    focus. The reader might well conclude that Eaton had emptied his desk drawers of remaining
                    manuscripts and thrown them together in this book.</p>
            <p>Reps's work is more coherent with a definite focus on Saint Louis views and viewmakers. In
                    the first half of the nineteenth century artists generally depicted the nascent community from the
                    Illinois shore of the Mississippi River, showing the warehouses along the Saint Louis levee and a
                    scattering of steeples and domes <pb n="443" id="VAA4025-086-4-103"/> to indicate other prominent
                    buildings in the background. Then after 1850 aerial views of the city became more common,
                    illustrating not only shoreline buildings but other significant structures as well. In
                    Reps's opinion the high point in Saint Louis viewmaking was Camille Dry's
                    exhaustive portrayal of the city. In 1875 Dry published 110 plates offering a comprehensive
                    depiction of every section of Saint Louis. Each individual building is visible in Dry's
                    plates, and thus the present-day viewer gains valuable insight into the physical structure and
                    nature of a major nineteenth-century midwestern metropolis.</p>
            <p>Together Reps's views and Eaton's detailed consideration of midwestern warehouses
                    shed light on the nature of urban life in the nineteenth-century heartland. Their works are not
                    ambitious initiatives seeking to fit all the pieces of the past together. And their personal
                    interests expressed in these studies may not attract a wide audience. Yet students of the Midwest
                    can benefit from both volumes.</p>

                    referred to as FSA photographs even though they were generated by three different governmental
                    entities—the Resettlement Administration (RA), the Farm Security Administration (FSA),
                    and the Office of War Information (OWI). Most of the FSA photographers left personal cachets on a
                    corpus that exposed the frayed social fabric of post-Depression, pre-World War II America. FSA
                    photographs were published frequently, and in some cases repeatedly, in contemporary governmental
                    and commercial publications: they were exhibited extensively in retrospectives or thematic shows.
                    The more recognizable photographs were used so often that staff photographer Dorothea Lange labeled
                    them "cookie cutters," but the vast majority of photographs received little or no
                    exposure. To this day, the images continue to interest historians <pb n="444" id="VAA4025-086-4-104"/> and aestheticists alike. Most of the photographers who were initially hired were artists in their
                    own right before joining the FSA, and thus many of their photographs have been evaluated in artistic
                    terms in light of artistic careers. The conception, gestation, and the subsequent promulgation of
                    official images, however, necessitates their further examination as a visual treatise or gestalt
                    with utilitarian eyes.</p>

                    work comprises more than 40 percent of the images, Jack Delano, John Vachon, and Arthur Rothstein.
                    Images by each of these photographers are represented throughout the book, but most of the sections
                    focus on particular assignments or projects: Lee's photographs of the 1937 <geogName>Ohio

                    photographers, but 80 percent of the Minnesota volume is composed of the work of just two

                    regions, assignments, activities, events, and FSA projects. With some exceptions, such as
                    Lee's series on logging camps or Vachon's documentation of life on a family
                    friend's farm, continuity within the book is inconsistent, as photographs from the same
                    assignments are often scattered throughout. The arrangement lends little to a comprehension of how
                    the photographs were used by the government or others, and the reader comes away with the impression
                    that the photographers' results were simply filed away. On the positive side, it should be
                    noted, however, that Reid is more thorough in the sectional introductions in both of these books

                    a "pick-a-state, any-state" pattern is emerging where market-driven researchers
                    troop off to the Library of Congress to select images, then hurry back to yet-one-more large
                    university press for publication before someone else realizes they could do the same. Unfortunately
                    these books have taken on a cookie-cutter persona, mimicking the style of Beverly Brannan and David
                    Horvath's Kentucky volume in format, structure, size, typeface, titles, and subtitles.

            <p>An American would have had to have been living on the moon during the past decade to have been
                    unaware of the farm crisis. Newspaper articles, segments on television news, concerts by rock stars,
                    and pronouncements by politicians, leaders of farm organizations, and government bureaucrats
                    regularly drew attention to the plight of farmers losing land that had been in their families for
                    generations. Even more ominous than the personal tragedies suffered by a hard-working people was the
                    danger that the crisis would destroy the family farm and replace it with faceless corporate
                    agribusiness.</p>
            <p>In this splendid little volume, Mark Friedberger investigates the farm crisis in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, the nation's preeminently agricultural state. Using a combination of careful
                    archival research in land and court records in county courthouses, the reading of local newspapers
                    and government reports, and extensive interviews of 135 farm families, Friedberger provides an
                    insightful and balanced picture of how the crisis affected <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>'s farm families. The families Friedberger interviewed were not a random
                    sample; he conducted interviews in three areas with different conditions, sought families with at
                    least two generations on the farms, and had to confine his interviews to those willing to
                    participate. If, therefore, his discoveries cannot be considered "typical" in any
                    statistical sense, they nevertheless provide valuable information about the personal effects of the
                    crisis on the farm population—of mounting generational and sibling tensions, of the
                    increasing role of women in decision making, of the growing importance of off-farm work, especially
                    by women.</p>
            <p>Farm families that faced the greatest hardships were those who borrowed on the security of the rising
                    value of their land to buy more land and machinery to work it at high prices and spent a
                    considerable amount of borrowed money to increase significantly their standards of living. Those
                    most likely to weather the downturn were those who inherited their land, received help from family
                    members, and eschewed rapid expansion financed on borrowed money. Amidst considerable variation
                    between those who suffered and even failed and those who did not and between those who saw family
                    and community ties crumble in the face of trouble and those who did not, what emerges from
                    Friedberger's study is the basic conservatism of Iowa farm families. Even among those who
                    suffered and failed, radicalism, even of the relatively bland variety of neopopulism, made few
                    inroads. The affected farmers most often sought to solve their problems as individuals or, more
                    precisely, as individual families. As Friedberger puts, it, "the farm families …
                    found little value in … [the] verbiage packaged for their consumption." If many
                    became "more cynical and alienated than ever before" (pp. 150-51), those who
                    remained after the "shake-out" embranced <pb n="448" id="VAA4025-086-4-108"/> no
                    significant new policies. Farming in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> "goes on much as it did before the crisis" (p. 160).</p>
            <p>In the longer-run, however, the shake-out of the 1980s merely continued the trend toward larger, more
                    capital intensive agriculture. Farmers retain ownership of the land, but become junior partners in
                    international agribusiness enterprises; they assume the greatest risks but enjoy the fewest
                    benefits. If Friedberger does not discuss this trend in detail, his discussion of what is only its
                    latest manifestation provides rich insights into the attitudes and outlooks of the nation's
                    declining number of farm families.</p>
