            <p>Students of American social life have come to regard the everyday affairs of the common man as vital
                    in the national history. Many excellent studies have been made of the national life in general. To
                    date, however, it may be safely assumed that Americans are still in a pioneering stage in this
                    field. In the more general phases of history vast quantities of manuscripts, documents, diaries, and
                    published sources have been gathered. The tendency has been to classify historical interests by the
                    scope and fields in which they fall. From the prestige point of view, constitutional history has
                    been far more important than that of rural America, or discussion of American foreign policy history
                    has taken precedence over that of the so-called American way of life. The biography of an average
                    president of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has appeared much more important to both the author's personal reputation
                    and his readers than has that of one of the great American common men. Yet much of the fabric of our
                    national history has been woven from the yarn of everyday, folksy human affairs of the thousands of
                    rural communities.</p>
            <p>At present much lip service is paid the American way of life. Despite an almost worshipful attitude
                    toward this type of civilization, many phases of it remain largely unexplored by historians.
                    Collected records dealing with many of the more earthy and human aspects of American life are
                    largely uncollected, and prestige returns from the tedious research necessary to produce an
                    intelligible story are indeed small. Nevertheless, it is almost impossible to understand the
                    American people without digging into some of the basic sources of the <list type="footnotes">

                    importance that so many institutions have developed upon a common pattern. Except for slight local
                    variations, a member of a rural church in the sedate East would be perfectly at home in a similar
                    church in the Southwest. The political patterns of rural politics differ merely in details of local
                    techniques and approaches rather than in fundamental principles. Rural community life in the South
                    differs from that in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> or the Northwest only in degree. Isolation has influenced people in the same general
                    way all across the continent. Over the centuries Americans have grown into a national people under
                    varied geographic conditions despite the staggered time phases in their maturity, but in remarkably
                    few incidents have they varied the rural pattern enough to make it wholly different from that of the
                    rest of the country. Certain institutions, such as the country church, the country school, store,
                    county town, political campaigns, and country newspaper press have from the beginning characterized
                    rural America. Any one of these presents a fair field for worthwhile research in American social
                    history. None of these, however, surpasses the country newspaper as a colorful and literate source
                    reflecting much of our way of life. The country press is almost as old as the art of printing in
                    North America. Before 1865 the weekly newspaper press in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was widely dispersed, and it was a poor county seat indeed which did not have its local
                    paper. Not only was the newspaper a necessary vehicle by which news was spread about, but it was
                    likewise an adjunct to partisan local politics. Before a political party could make headway it
                    needed a newspaper to slant its news, make its announcements and arguments, and to sustain its
                    peculiar contentions. In short, the editorial page was both a unifying and dignifying instrument in
                    the hands of an editor who could impress upon his readers the importance of the printed word.
                    Volumes like Clarence S. Brigham's <hi rend="i">History and Bibliography of American
                        Newspapers, 1690–1820</hi>, Alden Brothers' <hi rend="i">American

                        Directory</hi>, reflect the vast expenditure of energy on the part of the little newspaper
                    press. If the weekly papers do not constitute the main backbone of newspaper publishing in the
                    larger sense in this country, they at least monopolize the space in the guides. In 1929 there were
                    2,964 counties in the forty-eight states, and there were 11,869 country newspapers, or approximately
                    four papers to the county.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>It has been an established custom that wherever a county was formed and local political and social
                    affairs came to a focus, a newspaper editor and printer quickly appeared on the scene. It is one of
                    the remarkable facts in American technical history that ingenious printers moved type and presses
                    along with the roll of the frontier westward. They have carried on the rather complicated and
                    delicate business of printing without too much difficulty. Official life of the organized political
                    community was only one of the reasons for the appearance of weekly newspapers. Local society
                    demanded a publicity outlet for its expanding pride. The great American local brag has ever been
                    publicized in the country weekly. The "best" and the "biggest,"
                    and sometimes the "worst" in cases of local calamity have ever been magic words
                    with the country editor. Possibly one of the best established traits as an American people is the
                    love of publicity. Seeing their names in print, no matter how insignificant the source, has kept
                    large numbers of Americans believing they were important. The printed word has indeed been magic,
                    and in the pragmatic terms of dollars and cents the business of vanity printing has been relatively
                    a profitable one. Business enterprises, like individuals, have thrived on publicity. Advertising has
                    long been one of the most important aspects of business operation. It has never been the intention
                    of ingenious merchants and manufacturers to keep their products a secret from a widely dispersed
                        public.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because American society historically has been significantly rural, the country newspaper has been
                    highly reflective of the social growth. After 1865 the weekly press became nearly as standardized as
                    an institution under the management of individualists, such as were the country editors, would
                        permit.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> A subscriber to the weekly Tillamook, <placeName>

                            Locally, merchants have made known both their goods and economic philosophies through the
                            columns of the hometown papers. It was not unusual for a merchant to write a column of
                            homely humor, gossip, or philosophy while he was subtly apprising his customers of the goods
                            in his store.</item>

                            unions," for the purpose of facilitating the publication of local papers where both
                            printing facilities and news were limited. Too, boiler plate in column width, and story
                            length was made available on a cheap rate which encouraged a badgered editor to run the copy
                            as his own.</item>

                    only and not in basic philosophy. Within twelve years after the Civil War most of the country papers
                    were using ready print and boiler plate with the result that some stories appeared in country papers
                    everywhere. Only in explosive sectional politics did the patented insides editors use extreme care
                    not to antagonize their subscribers.</p>
            <p>For fifty years or more the ready-print and boiler-plate editors were careful not to antagonize
                    unsophisticated country readers by use of profanity in any form, talking about the female figure,
                    taking sides in political issues, or publishing laudatory articles on the wrong side of the line
                    about men and issues in the Civil War.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> They played safe by writing long columns

                    mouldy British flavor, they were quick to use it. Correct manners for all sorts of social occasions,
                    most of them unknown to countrymen, were discussed as though every American farmer and his wife
                    expected at sometime to stand as honored guests in a receiving line at the White House. Actually
                    rural subscribers had either little occasion or real intention of following the foppish codes of
                    Victorian social behavior. Nevertheless, it was a mighty pleasant way for them to while away time by
                    reading how they might act in society.</p>
            <p>Ready-print editors took up where William H. McGuffey left off, and preached good morals in every
                    issue. Perhaps next to the political tone to the average country paper, morality was the next

                    before 1915, told how one might expect to succeed in the age of voracious robber barons. In the
                    highly idealistic vein of the country newspaper, success, however, was not by the true robber baron
                    formula. Sometimes stories told how a young man devoid of everything but manly beauty and a
                    wonderfully developed nineteenth century code of morals won both riches and romance by a single
                    gallant act. So all an <placeName>

                    two-fisted dog-eat-dog manner would spot the noble youth and hoist him to economic security in a
                    single boost.</p>
            <p>Where the ready-print editors guided themselves by the genteel code of the late Victorian era, the
                    individual local editor followed a more localized formula. They printed what they could get by with,
                    and since they were so intimately attuned to their readers' moral attitudes they went
                    pretty far at times. Perhaps it would be nearer the truth to say that some of them gauged the tenor
                    of their writings to their capacity to fight. Women and love affairs were favorite topics. By the
                    old code a despoiled woman was indeed a fallen woman, and many editors advocated the use of buckshot
                    to avenge the spoliation of female virtue. Nevertheless, a little scandal was a joy and a delight.
                    Long columns were published about social tragedies, and editors, tongue in cheek, defended family
                    honor while publicizing all the intimate details of social tragedy.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Unlike the
                    scared rabbit press of the present day, the old boys were not afraid to cast their eyes about the
                    community and point accusing fingers at likely adventurers, who if not specifically guilty, were not
                    above being so. They called a spade a spade, and when local prostitutes ran afoul of the law they
                    did not hesitate to label them as such, and then raked up their sordid past to justify their
                    attitudes.</p>

                    out of riding on a gentle moonlight evening in a "hug-me-tight" buggy. Some of
                    them were opposed to the prevailing habit of clutching girls by the arms as though they were sacked

                    This, they labeled, as the uncouth act of a dude. Gentlemenly plowboys bent their elbows so their

                    reminisce nostalgically on the joys and delights of courting in an old-fashioned country parlor when
                    the fire burned low, the old folks were in bed, and the lamp was out of oil. The reader could take
                    his choice as to which advice he wished to heed, but whichever he chose the knowing editor warned
                    the shy lad that courting was like going swimming for the first time in the spring. It was a
                    delightful experience once you made up your mind to jump in and get wet from head to heels.</p>
            <p>The accounts of weddings were almost as numerous as were those of robberies, murders, and public
                    hangings. Upon most of these occasions editors felt called upon to produce their most flowery prose.
                    Their florid stories lie buried and un-exploited in the early files. Students of the late nineteenth
                    and early twentieth centuries' would do well to read these papers. Like the ornate dress,
                    furniture, parlors, and social manners of this period, wedding reports were excessively saccharine.
                    Holding strongly to the theory that weddings were made on earth and bonded in heaven, reporters
                    described these tender affairs against backgrounds which even excelled the decorative themes of the
                    contemporary valentines. Every groom was a perfect lover and gentleman, and every bride was as
                    beautiful and pure as driven snow—that is, she was if she had a society wedding.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> As for the plain country lass who had neither the know-how nor the means with
                    which to launch herself in matrimony before a much decorated marriage altar, she sometimes got less

                    slender as a willow, swift as a gazelle and shy as a doe. She was beseiged by a stock type rural
                    snaggle-toothed bumpkin who had heavy hands and a direct manner. He went by the romantic citified
                    name of Larry Farnsworth. Larry wanted Dora badly, but Dora said no, when shet meant yes, and in the

                    the remaining number of kisses, but they were to be no more intimate than a mere brushing of the

            <p>Where ready-print editors had refused to mention female clothing, the local editors overworked the
                    subject. Hats, petticoats, garters, brassieres, and stockings all came in for their share of
                    facetious remarks. This subject of female dress seemed ever to have had an evil fascination. A
                    sample of editorial dallying with the delicacy of ladies' clothing is the following
                    whimsicality. It was said a sweet young lady went into a store to purchase a pair of garters, and
                    explained her wish to a clerk in the following obscure manner: "It is my desire to obtain a
                    pair of circular appendages, capable of being contracted or expanded by means of oscillated
                    burnished steel appliances, that sparked like particles of gold leaf set with <placeName>

                    the lower extremities, which inanimate delicacy forbids me to mention."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Despite all this frivolity, there was underneath a staunch vein of the strictest gentility
                    and moral conviction that the American woman was the epitome of grace and virtue, and if her
                    reputation was sullied, country editors stood ready to do battle as vigorously aroused and
                    ink-smeared knights.</p>
            <p>In an altogether different field of social activity, the rural press has preserved a fabulous record
                    of violence in America. No historian has undertaken a major study of this important aspect of
                    American social history. Frequent mention of violence has been made in books treating the westward
                    movement, but basically the whole national story still lies unexploited. This is a ghastly chapter
                    in history, and its telling would be repulsive to a marked degree, but a great part of the local and
                    state income has been spent in combating this social failure. Criminal violence has ever been highly
                    newsworthy. When a crime occurred, it not only received front-page coverage in the locality, but
                    numerous services spread the news abroad. Endless columns of grand jury presentments, and the
                    results of court trials were emphasized. No one has examined the grand <list type="footnotes">

                    recommendations, despite the fact the American people have placed great confidence in the
                    institution. Murder, robbery, rape, resistance to social discrimination, labor disputes, community
                    feuds, race outbreaks, family fights, and regulator wars have all abounded in American social
                    development. Using no other source than the country newspaper, the historian can reconstruct much of
                    this unhappy but meaningful chapter of the past. However much the squeamish would like to ignore
                    much of it, it is a fact that a fully rounded history cannot be written without some consideration
                    of this phase of American social life. The young scholar who takes time, and who has enough
                    imagination to dredge this important source of information on the occurrence of crime will make a
                    significant contribution to American historical scholarship.</p>
            <p>In general, the history of agricultural development has been outlined in numerous historical and
                    scientific studies. Several books have given good accounts of the age of agricultural unrest and
                    dissatisfaction following the Civil War, but none of them has come to grips with the real social
                    aspects of farm life at the local level. The country newspaper was primarily a servant of the
                    farmer. It publicized his social and economic life, and depended upon him for subscriptions and as
                    patrons of its advertisers. If the farmer became displeased with his paper, the editor soon found
                    himself without business. Also, editors knew that in a final analysis such political favors as they
                    enjoyed came indirectly from farmer subscribers because they largely controlled local politics and
                    patronages. This, however, was not a hard and fast rule. The country publisher was generally a
                    conservative man who wedded his editorial policy to that of one or the other of the major political
                    parties. When farmers went running after third party movements, editors undertook to counsel them to
                    go slow and seek reforms through the established political order. The intimate story of the Alliance
                    and the Populists' social activities are told in the weekly papers. Few of the formal
                    histories of this important upheaval in American politics have presented these reform movements as
                    they applied specifically to the local communities.</p>
            <p>Aside from the purely political and economic affairs of the American farm, the weekly newspaper has
                    recorded an earthy picture of weather conditions, the succession of seasons, and the results of
                    harvests. On a broader scale the mouldering pages of the local journals contain an intimate view of
                    the whole fabric of rural life. Its social affairs, religious meetings, <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-048-3-015"/> tragedies, disappointments, failures, limited vision, reluctances to
                    admit the need for change all stand revealed. Southern country papers, for instance, hammered away
                    incessantly for four generations in an effort to improve the way of life on the southern farm.
                    Preaching a doctrine of diversifications, and living at home, they fussed at their obstinate
                    subscribers from one crop season to another. Their doctrine of progress was a fundamentally sound
                    one, but their technique was that of a futile and constant scold. The editors really failed
                    miserably to develop sound answers for their constituents' agricultural woes. It was in
                    their power to help develop better markets, the grading of produce, supplying better market
                    information, publicizing newer farming methods, and to advocate extensive agricultural education. No
                    really good study of farming; as a way of life can be written without historians spending long hours
                    turning the pages of country newspapers. The advertisements, stock and produce sales accounts,
                    farmer picnics, and social gatherings all present a graphic picture of everyday living.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>The rural mind, and it is perhaps no different from any other, has ever been captivated by the
                    unusual. Rural life at best has had its long drab periods, and anything that broke the tedium was of
                    genuine interest. Also, country editors were hard pressed at times to find enough news to fill up
                    their two home-printed pages. As a result, the sources of American folk culture are much richer.
                    Ghost stories by the hundreds were published. Whether or not editors believed them, they found their
                    news value sufficiently good to give them space. Skeletons were found in caves, wells, hollow trees,
                    and buried beneath houses. All of these were paraded across printed pages with speculation as to how
                    they met their fate. Occasionally these stories were made complete by giving the solutions of
                    age-old community mysteries. Any strange natural phenomenon was recorded. The rural American has
                    ever had a long standing respect for the sky. Being out under it so much, and being so vitally
                    concerned with weather conditions, it was an impelling factor in his life. Any curious cloud
                    formation at once took on an ominous meaning. Forever people were reporting that they had seen the
                    national Great Seal, the figure of a woman, of a giant eagle, or the reflection of cities in the
                    sky. Things fell out of the clouds. Fish dropped down to <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Nature herself stirred the wonder of the countryman. Plants grew into every conceivable form. The
                    common Irish potato was a master of contortion and editorial desks were littered with unearthly
                    specimens which resembled everything from Shakespeare to Gabriel's trumpet. Out of hen
                    houses came a veritable succession of abnormalia in the form of eggs connected together as Siamese
                    twins, with discolorations on the shells in the form of plainly visible letters and other mysterious
                    markings. The superstitious believed that all these phenomenon had some foreboding, usually evil,
                    for the future. Lambs grew single spiraled horns that made them unicorns, pigs were born hairless,
                    with eyes of sheep, the noses of monkeys, the ears of rabbits, the horns of bulls, and with two
                    heads. Persimmon trees were said to sprout from the backs of grub worms, fence posts grew limbs, and
                    roses forgot the seasons and bloomed in winter. A sample of these <hi rend="i">lusus nature</hi>

                    other delicacies. Without these wonders the columns of the papers would now be much less

                    treasures stirred readers to action. Sometimes fabulous stories were set afloat of rich natural
                    mineral deposits. Eastern newspapers published provocative accounts of finding pirate loot in the
                    sands. Imaginative editors asked only two things of an incident which promised a story: first, that

                    affairs was a delicate matter for the editor. Of all the patrons of a newspaper, none was more
                    critical than they and their ardent church members. Despite this sensitivity the weekly press
                    published a revealing story of religious affairs and attitudes.</p>
            <p>Occasionally an editor circulated a partially completed yarn among his fellows, and as it passed from
                    one editorial desk to another it grew into either a full blown column of crude humor, or a pathetic
                    tale of sadness and defeat. Sometimes an imaginative publisher would begin a lying campaign in which
                    he tried to outdo his fellows by describing strange animals which prowled his territory, or
                    recounting perfectly impossible happenings which frightened more gullible readers half to death. In
                    this respect many a country publisher was also a reporter for city dailies and he sometimes made up
                    for the lack of news by fabricating impossible yarns which were published for fact.</p>
            <p>One of the functions of the country paper, stated in many dedicatory promises, was to guard the
                    public against the slick swindlers who preyed upon isolated rural people. At least five traditional
                    types of wolves have fattened on the ignorant and unwary countrymen in the <placeName>

                    anti-explosion powders to be used in kerosene lamps, cheap money salesmen, and the patent
                    infringement rascals.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Patent medicine men worked through the papers as well as
                    on their own. As a matter of fact the country press made the vast patent medicine business possible.
                    The Lydia Pinkham Company could hardly have survived without the tremendous campaigns conducted by
                    its imaginative advertising manager James T. Wetherald. As early as 1895 this company spent eight
                    hundred thousand dollars annually for space in newspapers, <list type="footnotes">

                    hundred thousand dollars. Wetherald was said to have considered the country weeklies the second best
                    source of advertising. When Charles Pinkham died on November 10, 1900, he was considered
                    America's most important advertiser, and his company's black and white line
                    drawings were said to be the best display advertising in use at that time.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    which has just felt the heavy hand of the Federal Trade Commission, have long enjoyed the luscious
                    returns of cheap rural advertising. Currently Senator Dudley LeBlanc of <placeName>

                    golden harvest from the same source with his wonder tonic Hadacol.</p>
            <p>Lightning rod salesmen did not buy space in the papers, and the bitter attacks directed against them
                    might have been engendered partly by this fact. An editorial maxim was, "Regard not the
                    siren voice of him who peddles lightning rods for a living." These unscrupulous leeches
                    made perfectly fantastic propositions to their simple-minded customers. One was an offer to give
                    away the first thirty feet of rod and to throw in a five dollar bill for good measure. This usually
                    broke down the resistance of the victim, who forgot to ask how much the additional footage would
                    cost. Another fine swindle was that of the man who claimed to be a patent medicine man, but who did
                    not work too hard at his trade. His trick was to make friends with farmers and then repay their
                    hospitality by showing them how to make a new kind of automatic gate. When he had equipped a number
                    of farms with his gates, he left the community. In a few days a second man appeared and threatened
                    to sue those who had infringed his patent unless they paid from ten to thirty dollars royalty on
                    each illegal gate they had in use.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Country roads were kept hot by peddlers who
                    went from house to house selling powders and colored salts which they claimed would prevent kerosene
                    lamps from exploding. If the country papers are to be even partly credited with telling the truth,
                    then our father's and grandfather's generations of Americans were indeed
                    simple, gullible ones.</p>

            <p>Not all the materials in the country journals, of course, reflected gullibility, criminality, casual
                    curiosity, or frivolity. The great bulk of space was taken up with description of simple day-to-day
                    community affairs. Local columns kept readers posted on what was happening about them, and who was
                    important enough week-by-week to get their names in the paper. On anniversary occasions there were
                    reviews of local history and accomplishments. On centennial occasions county and institutional
                    histories of considerable merit were published. In 1876 the whole system of American country
                    newspapers promoted and published histories of their counties, biographies of their famous citizens,
                    and personal recollections of old timers. This vast storehouse of materials has been largely
                    undisturbed in the last sixty years. Records of all kinds of crusades await discovery by industrious
                    historians. So far only the accounts of the national and broader regional aspects of prohibition,
                    temperance, woman suffrage, public education, and other social uplift crusades have received
                    attention. The primary grass roots efforts are just as interesting, and sometimes they are more
                    fundamental. These are the ones which reflect the opinions of the home folks. Also, they are the
                    ones which more often than not were given generous amounts of space and editorial treatment by the
                    local publishers.</p>
            <p>It would be impossible to write a truthful history of the public education movement in this country
                    without use of the country newspapers. It was they who crusaded for education from the beginning.
                    Not only did editors have a genuinely altruistic attitude toward this vital community service, but
                    likewise the selfish one of wanting readers. Every aspect of educational advancement is reflected in
                    the news stories, and most of the local philosophy of education is reflected in the abundance of
                    editorial comment.</p>
            <p>It can be said with assurance that many of the studies of the American mind and culture touch only
                    the more formal aspects of the subject. Not until scholars have dug out the editorials and news
                    stories of the country newspapers can they present a fully rounded history of the American mind.
                    After all the rural mind and social mores are a tremendously significant part of
                    America's intellectual structure.</p>

                    father of American phrenology was cut short by death, which has been attributed to the dry and
                    highly electrically charged atmosphere of America and the high mental excitement of Americans.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> But the apt obituary, quoted above, indicated that Spurzheim had left his
                    mark, and that more was to be heard of the new theories which had seized the imagination of his
                    American friends.</p>
            <p>Early nineteenth century America was ripe for the introduction of this new science. Although medical
                    practitioners of the early 1800's were no exception to the rule that every period of
                    history finds men thinking themselves more advanced than were their predecessors, the fact remains
                    that in medicine, as in politics, it was a period of controversy, uncertainty, and clashing ideas.
                    Especially was this true of the western states, <placeName>

                    choice or necessity, relied upon their own concoctions for the treatment of disease.</p>
            <p>The few doctors who chose to practice in this region were so handicapped by the lack of education,
                    supplies, and transportation facilities, that it is little wonder that many of the settlers
                    preferred to use their own remedies, or to avail themselves of the services of the ever-present
                    quacks.</p>
            <p>The following account written by Dr. Robert Boal, is an apt description of what the average midwest
                    doctor was up against. "The doctor had to be his own pharmacist. He made his own pills and
                    tinctures, compounded all his medicines, and generally carried all he required, as, with saddle-bags

                    angel of mercy, although his homely garb and rough appearance looked anything but angelic. His life
                    was one of peril, toil and privation. The country was new and thinly settled, and his rides were
                    long and solitary; his patients were scattered over a wide expanse of territory; his travel was
                    mostly performed on horseback, and its extent and duration was measured by the endurance of himself
                    and his horse. He struggled through … mud and swamps and swollen streams. He was often
                    compelled to make long detours…. His rest was often taken in the saddle. …
                    From necessity he was self-reliant and courageous. Every emergency … he was generally
                    compelled to meet alone and unaided. … His fees were small and his services were often
                    paid for in promises, seldom in money, of which there was but little. The products of the country
                    … was the general and most reliable circulating medium, and with this the doctor was
                    usually paid."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were few books to which the early midwest doctor could turn for guidance. Equipment was equally
                    scarce. He usually had a stethoscope—after 1830—and sometimes he was fortunate
                    enough to possess pewter bedpans, and a few other items; but more often he used whatever was
                    available. Any shingle was good enough for a splint, while the physician's fingers served
                    as measures of temperature and blood pressure. His drugs were typified by horseradish, skunk
                    cabbage, sage, thorn apple, butternut, elder, throatwort, and slippery elm. There was also some
                    mercury, quinine, and bismuth—and lots of calomel, which some physicians prescribed for
                    almost everything.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Bleeding was highly recommended and widely used, as was

            <p>The western physician was a public servant as well as a pill roller. He was expected to answer any

                    results were many dissatisfied patients and a constant clamor for more and better doctors.</p>
            <p>A major cause of the scarcity of doctors was the lack of medical education in the region. In 1833
                    there were only two medical colleges west of the Alleghenies—the Medical Department of
                    Transylvania University, founded by Dr. Benjamin W. Dudley in 1817, and the Medical College of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, founded by Dr. Daniel Drake in 1819. By 1835 the Medical College of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> had graduated 239 doctors, and it was during this period that the Medical Department of
                    Transylvania was at its peak. But it is doubtful, with conditions as they were, that all of these
                    graduates remained in the West. Many western doctors had been trained in the medical schools of the
                    East, such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, and a few had even studied in Europe. But prior to 1835, at least, a majority of the
                    western doctors got their training by serving apprenticeships—usually three
                    years—and had no medical degrees.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, poorly trained and meagerly equipped, the pioneer doctor went forth to battle the elements and
                    administer to the ailing. That he met with dissatisfaction and competition is hardly surprising. He
                    was accused of disseminating poisonous medicine and of bleeding his patients too generously.
                    Furthermore, he was criticized for bleeding the purses of his patients too severely, a criticism not
                    altogether unfounded.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> That the regular doctors promised no certain cures, as
                    did many of the irregulars, was also a cause for suspicion on the part of the <list type="footnotes">

                    people were more familiar with the simple herb remedies.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The American
                    scientific mind, which eventually was to throw out most of these simple remedies, had not yet

            <p>Faced with these conditions, and catering to these ideas, the western pioneer turned to the less
                    reputable practitioners for relief. "The quack, the medical confidence-man, was very much
                    in evidence in the early days. Human credulity and stupidity prepared a rich harvest for charlatans
                    of all kinds." And by the middle of the nineteenth century no less than seventeen
                    "varieties" of doctors, in addition to the regular members of the profession, were
                    named as practicing: eclectic, botanic, homeopathic, uroscopian, old Thomsonian, hydropathic,
                    electric, faith, spiritual, herbalist, electropathic, vita-pathic, botanico-medical, physio-medical,
                    physio-electric, hygeo-therapeutic, and "traveling."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

                    </placeName> was the leader in this movement. As early as 1811 its legislature passed a law which
                    divided the state into five medical districts and named three censors in each "whose duties
                    it was to issue licenses to those desiring to practice medicine."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> But
                    this act, having proved to be inadequate, was repealed in 1812; and the Medical Society of the State

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> was set up as a legal body to examine candidates and issue licenses. This was followed
                    in 1818 by an act which gave legal recognition to formal medical education. All of these efforts
                    proved of little avail, however, and in 1833 the state legislature, "discouraged at the
                    futile attempt to suppress quackery by law, gave up in despair and repealed all existing laws
                    pertaining to the practice of physic and surgery," and until 1896—sixty-three

                    few of the more representative ones is necessary in order for one to understand and appreciate the
                    scope and nature of the career of the subject of this study. For studied apart from this setting,
                    the ideas and teachings of Joseph Rodes Buchanan take on a grotesque and ridiculous appearance of
                    which they are largely undeserving.</p>
            <p>Although unorthodox methods in medicine are generally associated with the western pioneer, in reality
                    many—perhaps most—of them did not originate in the West, or even in America.
                    Europe and Asia were the birthplace of many of them, from whence they found their way to the eastern
                    seaboard of the New World and from there eventually moved into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> valleys. That the pioneers were not the only gullible persons in the world was fully
                    demonstrated by the success which Gall and Spurzheim had in continental Europe, and by the
                    overwhelming popularity which the latter enjoyed in the eastern part of this country. True, they met
                    with opposition in both places, but this opposition came mainly from the conservative old-line
                    practitioners; and this same group, though smaller in numbers, was equally opposed to the
                    introduction of new methods into the West.</p>
            <p>Homeopathy was one system of medicine which sprang from a European origin. Based on the theory that
                    diseases may be cured by remedies which produce on a healthy person effects similar to the symptoms
                    of the complaint of the patient, it was developed by Samuel Christian Friedrich Hahnemann in the
                    latter part of the eighteenth century.</p>
            <p>Born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> in 1755, Hahnemann began the study of medicine early in life and soon developed an
                    aversion to the excessive use of bleeding and mercury in the profession. He advocated the
                    improvement of sanitation and recommended the quarantining of contagious diseases; he also urged
                    frequent bathing, pure air, and proper clothing, all of which were revolutionary ideas in those
                    days. Using himself as a guinea pig, Hahnemann began experimenting with various types of drugs and
                    eventually discovered the law of similars, i.e., that a drug <pb n="239" id="VAA4025-048-3-027"/>
                    would cure a disease similar to the symptoms produced on a healthy person who took the drug; hence
                    the name, homeopathy, derived from the Greek words meaning "like" and
                    "disease." In 1796, Hahnemann presented his findings to the world through his
                    "Essay on a New Principle" in which he expounded the theory of the law of similars
                    and also maintained that the dynamic effect of drugs is increased by giving them in very small
                    doses, diluted even to a decillionth of the original strength.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    others. But homeopathy made its contribution to modern medical science, as did the other cults; for
                    Hahnemann's ideas about sanitation, quarantining, fresh air, and the like, were
                    eventually to be adopted, though it would be pretentious to assume that he was the only one to have
                    had such ideas.</p>
            <p>Thomsonianism was more nearly a native child of American minds and methods. Developed by Samuel
                    Thomson of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the early 1800's, it swept the country in the 1830's and
                    1840's. Thomson's thesis was that heat is the basis of health and that to
                    prevent death it is necessary only to prevent the departure of heat from the body. It followed then
                    that poor health was the result of a deficiency of heat and that to restore health one must return
                    the body heat to its natural extent.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For treatments, Thomson relied mainly on various herb concoctions, which he called Composition No. 1,
                    Composition No. 3, etc. Of the herbs, his favorite was the pokeweed, but he also employed steam
                    baths, electric shock, and other equally novel treatments.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    medical profession. But, taking them all in stride, he eventually came out victorious when in 1813
                    and again in 1823, the <placeName>

            <p>But trouble was brewing for the cult as early as 1827 when Wooster Beach later of eclectic fame, who
                    had been one of Thomson's early followers, split with Thomson over the question of
                    establishing botanical medical schools to train men in the cult. Thomson opposed such a move and the
                    result was that Beach established his own school in <placeName>

                    following the death of Thomson, in 1843, the cult went to pieces. Remnants of it found their way to
                    various other groups, and a few even joined the regular school;<hi rend="sup">25</hi> but the force
                    of the movement was broken, leaving the way open for the up and coming eclectic movement.</p>
            <p>Another cult which came in for its share of popularity was hydropathy, perhaps better known simply as
                    the "water cure." Based on the curative powers of water, it became, in the <placeName>

                    and water girdles were perhaps most commonly used and a good hydropathist knew that he was getting
                    results whenever "eruptions, sores and boils appeared beneath the compresses" of
                    his patients. Some followers of the system maintained that to swallow water was harmful; others
                    advocated it. Dr. Joel Shew of <placeName>

                    fatigue, and recommended the swallowing of ice lumps for a bleeding stomach. But he cautioned
                    against the possible reaction of such a powerful agent as water if mixed with food at mealtime.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>Priessnitz, the originator of the system, did not confine himself to the positive aspects of
                    treatment but added some negative elements. He forbade his patients the use of liquor, tobacco, tea,
                    and coffee, and advised them to eat only very plain foods and to take lots of exercise. His theory
                    was that "it is always the weak and enervated who are the most sensual and
                        debased."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>"Water, according to the hydropathists, was the most formidable as well as the purest of all
                    natural elements. … It was, indeed, next to man, the most favored of all His
                    [God's] creations." It was the panacea for all ills, and it was relatively
                    painless. These claims, advanced at a time when the practices of regular doctors were both painful
                    and uncertain in their results, largely account for the amazing success of the system, both in
                    Europe and in this country.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    there were many other practitioners and "medicine men" who can be classified as
                    nothing but quacks and frauds. For example, about 1803 a man calling himself "Professor

                            it is indicated by the following announcement which appeared in 1852: "Priessnitz,
                            the noted leader of the system of Hydropathy, died in his residence at Graefenburg on the
                            28th of November. … He was only 52 years of age, and left a fortune supposed to

                            seem to be a plausible explanation for a man who rose from the position of an

            <p>These few brief examples demonstrate the state of mind of the early nineteenth century American. It
                    was a period of uncertainty and of experimentation; a period in which men accepted a new system
                    wholeheartedly or rejected it with scorn. Ever in search of a means of alleviating the illness and
                    suffering which inevitably accompanied the rigors and primitive conditions of pioneer life, they
                    constituted a fertile field for the unscrupulous quack and for the often sincere but disillusioned
                    followers of the various cults. One man's opinion was as good as that of another and the
                    scientific mind of the layman had not sufficiently developed in most cases, to enable him to
                    separate the obviously bad from the possible good. Many patronized the unorthodox practitioners and
                    were satisfied; others dealt with the regular members of the profession and found them lacking. It
                    was thus a natural thing for each to experiment for himself and to defend his own discoveries. If
                    controversy and fraud resulted, they were only two necessary evils among many in the development of
                    a new nation.</p>

                    embraced theories and practices which are more directly related to the subject of this study. The
                    three developments were the growth and expansion of phrenology, mesmerism, and eclecticism, the
                    latter being a larger and more nearly orthodox system.</p>
            <p>The science—if it may be called that—of phrenology, as first developed by Gall
                    and Spurzheim, and as practiced for some thirty to forty years, was based on five principles: (1)
                    The brain is the organ of the mind. (2) The mental powers of man can be analyzed into a definite
                    number of independent faculties. (3) These faculties are innate, and each has its seat in a definite
                    region of the surface of the brain. (4) The size of each such region is the measure of the degree to
                    which the faculty seated in it forms a constituent element in the character of the individual. (5)
                    The correspondence between the outer surface of the skull and the contour of the brain surface
                    beneath is close enough to enable one to recognize the relative sizes of the organs by examining the
                    surface of the head. In modern times phrenology has professed to be primarily a system of
                    psychology, but its second and more popular claim, especially during the early years of its
                    practice, was that it afforded a method whereby the disposition and character of the subject might
                    be ascertained.</p>
            <p>Gall was not the first to work out the idea of phrenology; philosophers had had similar ideas from a
                    very early period. But Gall was the first to formulate the ideas into a definite system and to
                    expand that system until it reached the proportions of a science. He eventually determined, at least
                    to his own satisfaction, the functions of twenty-seven organs in the brain; but he made no attempt
                    to determine their specific outlines or to determine absolutely the functions of the whole brain.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Spurzheim, Gall's most prominent successor in Europe, modified and expanded the Gallian
                    system until it included thirty-five or thirty-seven organs in the brain. He also made an attempt to
                    locate the various organs in a more specific manner by dividing the whole surface of the cranium
                    with geometrical lines, in an effort accurately to point out the boundaries of each organ. In

                    Spurzheim tabbed them with philosophical terms, in an effort to explain the essential nature of
                    each. For instance, Gall spoke of the organ of "attachment and friendship" but
                    Spurzheim called it "adhesiveness."<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The work of Spurzheim superseded that of Gall in popular estimation; and the system of phrenology
                    taught in Europe and in America, prior to 1842, was substantially that of the former. But, since
                    Spurzheim originally got his ideas from the teachings of Gall, the latter has been called the
                    founder of phrenology and Spurzheim its propagator. Gall was "the great architect who
                    showed us where to build—who dug the foundation with his own hands, and commenced the
                        walls."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Spurzheim continued the work on those walls, and, in
                    1832, brought them to America, where other workmen eagerly seized upon them, and where they
                    eventually fell into the hands of an overly ambitious master craftsman who shaped them into
                    something bearing little resemblance to the original foundation.</p>
            <p>The death of Spurzheim on November 10, 1832, produced a "deep sensation" in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. "A public funeral was awarded to his remains, and a handsome monument was

                    </placeName> professors removed his brain and put it on exhibition. After an extended and
                    enthusiastically received tour of the eastern cities and schools, the pickled phrenological specimen
                    was offered to Europe—for a price, of course—but there were no takers.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if European enthusiasm for phrenology was dead in 1832, it was still in its infancy in America.
                    Countless men and women flocked to its banner, embraced it, and propagated it. Horace Mann called it
                    "the truest handmaiden of Christianity," while no less a personage than Henry Ward
                    Beecher, who had at first opposed the doctrine, became one of its most ardent defenders after one of

            </p>
            <p>It was through the influence of Beecher that the two brothers, O. S. and L. N. Fowler, who have been
                    credited with convincing the nation of the scientific accuracy of phrenology, became addicted to the
                    system. After hearing a debate in which Beecher made his most famous defense of phrenology, the
                    Fowler boys decided to make a career of it. For publicity they examined the Siamese Twins, lately
                    imported by P. T. Barnum. They then sought out Nicholas Biddle, whose phrenological fame had been
                    established in 1806 when he had allowed a cast to be made of his head by none other than Francis
                    Gall; they invaded the theater by charting the cranium of Junius Brutus Booth, and they sought to
                    determine the ability of those who ran the nation by examining Representative Henry Wise of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Eventually they became so popular that they were allowed to examine the head of President Andrew
                    Jackson, and found it to be "the largest… and the most splendidly equipped they
                    had ever encountered." Others who came to them included Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and
                    Daniel Webster; and it so happened that the organs of the nation's great men coincided
                    perfectly with what was known of their characters. Martin Van Buren, the Democratic presidential
                    nominee in 1836, was found to be of a nature to avoid work, but the Fowlers wisely kept this fact a
                    secret until after the election, thus, as nearly as possible, keeping phrenology on a nonpartisan
                        basis.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to their barnstorming tactics, the Fowler brothers founded <hi rend="i">The American
                        Phrenological Journal</hi>,<hi rend="sup">39</hi> which, together with their practical
                    application of phrenology —professionally examining heads and giving
                    charts—was a major factor in spreading the popularity of the system.</p>
            <p>In 1838, American phrenologists received another shot in the arm when George Combe,
                    Spurzheim's former pupil and his most ardent disciple in Europe, came to this country for
                    a three-year stay. From October, 1838, through February, 1839, he gave a series of sixteen lectures

            <p>On October 24, 1838, Combe noted that: "There are great numbers of 'practical

                    fortune-telling, is said to have created a strong feeling of disgust against Phrenology itself, in
                    the minds of men of science and education. This is unquestionably an evil; but on the other hand I
                    have found here a phalanx of very superior persons, belonging, most of them, to the learned
                    professions, who are excellent phrenologists."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> At another time he

            <p>There is strong evidence that phrenology had been introduced to the West prior to the time of
                    Spurzheim's appearance in the East. Dr. Charles Caldwell, a member of the expanding

                    adopted the science while in Europe and brought it back with him. There seems to be no evidence to
                    refute this statement, and it is known that in later years Dr. Caldwell was a staunch supporter of
                        phrenology.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> At any rate, the doctrine became very popular in the West and

                            dollars per lecture, he declined because the progress of phrenology had been "much

                    flocked to its practitioners, is suggestive of the present-day enthusiasm for psychiatry.</p>
            <p>Mesmerism, popularly known as animal magnetism, employed the power of suggestion and stimulated the
                    development of hypnosis, both of which play a part in modern medicine. Originating in <placeName>

                    </placeName> about 1775, the science adopted the name of its founder, Anton Mesmer; and after going

            </p>
            <p>Charles Poyen, a Frenchman, became America's most ardent advocate of mesmerism about 1836.
                    His literary ambitions had led him to write "A Philosophical and Historical Essay on
                    Slavery," but when he presented the essay to an eastern publisher the latter viewed it with
                    disfavor and suggested that Poyen's future fame might more definitely be established if
                    he could stir up as much excitement in America over animal magnetism as Spurzheim had created over
                    phrenology. Apparently Poyen was a venturesome soul for he took the jesting publisher at his word
                    and began to look around for a suitable subject for demonstrations. He selected a Miss Gleason, a
                    consumptive victim of a New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, where he demonstrated his powers by "magnetizing" Miss Gleason by a
                    series of manipulations over her body with his hands.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tour was proving to be rather successful when suddenly Colonel William Lette Stone, a journalist,
                    put a crimp in the campaign by discovering and publishing "The Report of Doctor Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Other Commissioners Charged by the King of <placeName>

            <p>Dr. James Esdaile, who became addicted to mesmerism and practiced the art while in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>, said that the report of the French Commission was justified because the evidence
                    presented in favor of mesmerism was so badly handled as to hide the simplicity of the science
                    "under a load of complicated machinery and various kinds of mummer."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> But whether justified or not, the report caused a furor among the straight-laced New
                    Englanders and Poyen's venture suffered accordingly.</p>
            <p>The chief claim of mesmerism to scientific fame was that it offered possibilities, through its appeal
                    to faith and imagination, of successfully treating disease, and, through its hypnotic powers, as a
                    means of performing painless surgery. Dr. Esdaile used it for the latter purpose on an Indian hog
                    dealer and reported that after about one hour of passing his hands over the patient's
                    face he was mesmerized and became insensible to all pain. In this condition the man underwent
                    surgery on three different occasions and each time testified that he felt no pain whatsoever.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were, however, limitations to what mesmerism could do for medical science, for not everyone was
                    responsive to its influence. An extremely sensitive person might be made insensible to pain within a
                    few minutes, but in general it took an hour or two of repeated efforts, and in some cases the
                    treatment completely failed. Dr. Esdaile believed that a person of "a high organization, in
                    whom the nervous and circulating systems were equally active, with a determined will, a resolution
                    to do the thing if possible, and a love of truth and humanity"<hi rend="sup">49</hi> was
                    most likely to reap the benefits of mesmerism.</p>
            <p>But mesmerism gained more fame and reaped greater profits from another group of practitioners who
                    went about the country demonstrating its unique possibilities merely as a means of entertainment.
                    There were many of these opportunists in the 1830's and 1840's and they
                    performed throughout the country before large audiences, who were willing to pay <list type="footnotes">

                    used various methods, but all of them depended upon the powers of hypnotism for gaining control of

                    awe with the strange and amusing things which the subjects would do at their command. A Mr. Keely,
                    who operated in the mid-western states, passed out silver coins to his audience and had them gaze
                    upon the coins for fifteen or twenty minutes, by which time several would be sufficiently somnolent
                    to be easily controlled. Keely then would exhibit his power over his subjects by giving commands
                    "which they are compelled to obey, and [by] making assertions which they are compelled to

            <p>Eclecticism, the most important native American medical cult, and the system which enjoyed the widest
                    popularity and the longest life of all the irregular systems, had its birth during the
                    1820's. It was an outgrowth of "the active protest against the polypharmacy and
                    heroic drug methods of a hundred years ago";<hi rend="sup">52</hi> but it was sufficiently
                    orthodox to gain the support of several members of the regular medical profession. Literally
                    speaking, the term "eclectic" means the practice of exercising choice among a
                    number of doctrines or systems. As applied by the eclectic school of medicine, it denoted the
                    selecting and the use of the most successful methods of medical practice to be found, whether they
                    came from the regular members of the profession or from one of the less reputable cults. Constantine
                    Samuel Rafinesque defined eclectics as "those who subject and adopt in practice whatever is
                    found beneficial, and who change their prescriptions according to emergencies, circumstances and

                    extractive process developed by William S. Merrell of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1847. Then followed the development of a series of fluid medicines "made by
                    dilutions of tinctures of vegetable substances and alcohol … with dilutions of simple
                    syrups." With these developments eclecticism became so popular that Dr. John Forbes could
                    say with assurances of support that the "Hygienic—the Eclectic—the
                    Hippocratic—the Rational System of treating disease is the only one that can be justified

                    being forced to close.</p>
            <p>Dr. John J. Steele was delegated to go into the <placeName>

                    </placeName> region the following year to select a suitable site for the new school; but in the
                    meantime Beach issued a circular which was sent to various points in the West and South "to
                    elicit such information as would enable him <hi rend="i">to</hi> make a judicious selection in
                    locating" the school. One of these circulars fell into the hands of Colonel James
                    Kilbourne, who, under the auspices of the Scioto Land Company, had been the founder of Worthington, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Kilbourne saw a chance to revive Worthington College, which had seen more prosperous
                    days, and upon his request the trustees of the college sent an invitation to Dr. Beach, offering him
                    the use of their charter and building for his proposed medical school. Dr. Steele was then sent to
                    Worthington to see that the location was suitable, and in December, 1830, instruction began in the
                    "Reformed Medical College of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The new school opened under the presidency of Dr. Steele, but he was soon succeeded by Dr. Morrow,
                    under whose leadership the enrollment advanced from seven or eight in 1831 to forty in 1836. The
                    institution continued to prosper and by 1839 the curriculum included anatomy and physiology,
                    chemistry and medical jurisprudence, theory and practice of medicine and midwifery, surgery and
                    diseases of women and children, botany, materia medica, and pharmacology.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

            <p>But in 1839 trouble began. The enrollment had begun to decline and the adoption of new regulations
                    failed to improve the situation. In addition there was dissension among some of the faculty members,
                    and the school was having financial troubles. When the state refused financial aid, as did the

                    several bodies had been illegally removed from their final resting places, a mob of angry citizens

                    1844 the faculty was four or five strong and the curriculum was about the same as that of the former
                    Worthington school. The program consisted of four to six lectures per day through a four-month
                    session, for which the students paid fifty-five dollars, plus small fees for certain special
                        services.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>

                            "resurrectionists," were plentiful in those days, as it was about the only
                            way students of anatomy had of acquiring cadavers. Joseph Nash McDowell, brother-in-law of
                            Daniel Drake, once took the body of a young girl from its grave, and soon after heard rumors
                            that friends of the girl were coming for the body. McDowell went to his laboratory that
                            night to hide the body and when he was ready to leave found that the building was surrounded
                            by men. He lay down on a table and covered himself with a sheet, whereupon the men entered
                            the room and proceeded to examine all of the bodies. One fellow, when he came to McDowell,
                            said, "Here is a fellow who died in his boots; I guess he is a fresh one."

            <p>By the end of 1846 the school had met the ten thousand-dollar property requirement, which was also
                    included in the charter, by moving into a newly erected building at the corner of Court and Plum
                    streets. The school was now well launched and attracted large classes to its halls. Steps were taken
                    to get for its students the privilege of attending the Commercial Hospital of the city, and in 1846
                    a clinic was established for purposes of practical instruction.</p>
            <p>The newly created institution met bitter opposition from the regular doctors, one of them going so
                    far as to say that medical science was not "susceptible of further improvement or
                    reform." Felter has described the history of the Institute as the history of "the
                    contest for freedom in medical thought and teaching," and as "the history of the
                    Godmother of American medicine," and declared that "few institutions can boast of
                    so many graduates in <hi rend="i">all</hi> States of the Union, and none can point with greater
                    pride to her alumni."<hi rend="sup">65</hi>

            <p>Thus, in 1840 the American medical profession was badly muddled. The regular members of the
                    profession continued to practice crude and outmoded methods. While on the other hand numerous
                    unorthodox groups, ranging from a few sincerely inspired reformers to many unscrupulous quacks, had
                    crowded into the field. The methods of the new groups, though unique, were generally less effective
                    than the orthodox practices, and many of them were positively harmful. There was, indeed, an earnest
                    need for enlightened reform; the field was wide open for anyone who had the correct treatment for
                    the malady and who had the aggressiveness to administer it.</p>

            <p>The western program of political action, thoroughly grounded in economic need, was repeatedly
                    rejected by the Polk administration. There had been a traditional support of western interests by
                    both parties for over a decade, but in many respects this support had been one of lip service and of
                    intermittent character. In the period of 1844–1845, however, changes were taking place in
                    the parties themselves and also in government policies, resulting in a growing suspicion in the
                    Northwest that sectional needs were not being met with adequate measures to alleviate the stress and
                    strain. Even the parties themselves were becoming distrustful. It is interesting to note that James
                    K. Polk, a political dark horse, had become president because of the failure to resolve the
                    cleavages of the faction.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    financial doldrums of the early part of the decade. The state debt had been adjusted, and the work
                    on the canals and railroads had been resumed. The character of the Indiana politician also played a
                    part in determining the actions of the state. Unlike the other states of the Northwest, the men who
                    were leaders in Indiana were not products of large settlements of New Englanders; they were
                    representative of the conglomerate nature of the Indiana population. Here again, it seems, that out
                    of diversity, there was much more unity. When Indiana's political behavior during the
                    Polk administration is viewed in the light of its comparative position with respect to its
                    neighbors, the treatment of the political questions of the tariff, internal improvements, and land
                    become more understandable.</p>
            <p>Starting in 1843, Indiana Democrats had attempted to indoctrinate their constituents with the evils
                    of the protective tariff. Governor James Whitcomb, who had achieved political success through his
                    widely distributed pamphlet, "Facts for the People," in which he sought to point
                    out to the farmers of the state the evils of protection, had challenged an almost hitherto
                    impregnable fortress. Whitcomb had made an effort in his pamphlet to show a connection between the
                    southern markets of the Indiana farmer and the ruinous tariff which was hampering the southern
                    planter. Written in simple language and using familiar hypothetical examples such as farmers selling
                    potatoes to townspeople, the governor had created alarm among the Whiggery of Indiana. Senator
                    Oliver H. Smith in an answer to this political textbook had claimed that: "This is the
                    first time, it is believed, in the history of Indiana, that a political party has raised aloft, and
                    flung to the breeze a flag inscribed with the Free Trade doctrines preached by Great Britain and <placeName>

                    But at the same time, Indiana's representatives had put a price on its advocacy of a
                    lower tariff. First, Edward A. Hannegan had expressed his views to Duff Green, and then John Pettit
                    in the House had also warned the South that it could not get the tariff until its support was given
                    to river and harbor improvements in the Northwest.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Although professing to their
                    constituents back home great interest in the tariff, other sectional demands also had to be met. The
                    question of the tariff was not so much a bargain in the sense of implying a sacrifice as it was a
                    holding out to attain other sectional demands.</p>
            <p>While Indiana's representatives were seemingly prepared to accede to the party pledges of
                    1844, some northwestern Democrats were turning away from the platform of the party. It was to round
                    up these strays from party solidarity that Indiana's representatives entered the tariff
                    debates.</p>
            <p>Robert Dale Owen was an ardent advocate of tariff reform and took up the question as one of western
                    as well as southern primacy. To him, there were certain progressive changes that must go on in
                    society and government. Protection could not be perpetuated in a republican society, but for the
                    sake of peace he was willing to abandon much which on the soundest principles of equity were just
                    and right. In that spirit, he urged the manufacturing states to come half way to meet the West and
                    the South.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>The representatives of special interests who were unwilling to consent to such a course, however,
                    chose to air their objections to the administration's policy. The party strife that
                    resulted prompted William W. Wick to call upon these discordant groups to mend their ways if they
                    were to remain Democrats, and he specifically accused John W. Tibbatts of <placeName>

                    </placeName> had attacked the provisions placing a heavy tax on coffee and tea; this Wick claimed
                    was an attempt of the Ohioan to become a special defender of the old ladies' tea and
                    coffee pots. Brinkerhoff's state had fared badly at the hands of Polk when the federal
                    patronage was distributed to the faithful of the party, and Wick referred to this by sarcastically
                    bringing out in his speech the fact that the <placeName>

                    Indiana Democrat attacked those who were trying to defeat the proposed tariff by whispering into the
                    ears of the northwestern leaders that it was a southern bill. Wick, like Owen, claimed it was a

                    </placeName> attempted to explain Wick's outburst to the House by saying Wick was trying

                    unanimous. Several explanations were offered for this solid support, some saying that the amendments
                    fixing higher schedules for wool and flaxseed had made the bill acceptable, others saying they felt
                    that sufficient concessions had been forced from the South.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    from Indiana accepted the bill in principle and found it needless from his point of view to continue
                    the discussion of it. He told the Senate that enough had been spoken in every town, village, and

            <p>Hannegan, no longer an enthusiastic supporter of the issues of 1844, said he would vote according to
                    his principles, but the fiery oratory that he had lent to the cause of manifest destiny no longer
                    spurred the Democracy on.</p>
            <p>The tariff issue in Indiana did not blow up a political storm within the Democratic party, and there
                    was no apparent sign of revolt in its congressional delegation. Wick's attack of the
                    discordant elements in the other states of the Northwest that were attempting to satisfy local
                    interests, apparently met with the approval of his Democratic colleagues, for they did not trouble
                    themselves to dissent.</p>
            <p>The appeal of Whitcomb to the common folk of the state in terms that were comprehendible to them had
                    probably prepared the way for this apathy, but coupled with this was the fact that Hoosiers had
                    little to protect—special interests had not developed in Indiana. Governor Whitcomb
                    congratulated the party on its success with the tariff issue, declaring in his address to the
                    legislature that the tariff revision had been made in accordance with the spirit of the age.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Whigs, who were quick to take up the issue, appointed a special committee to draft a reply to the
                    governor's message, and in his report, George B. Thompson harangued the governor for his
                    views on the tariff. This reply, which leaned upon many of the stereotyped phrases of the Whigs, was
                    used in their defense of protection. It is interesting to note that the Whigs of Indiana sought to
                    array Sir Robert Peel, James K. Polk, and the governor of Indiana in the same school. Referring to
                    the so-called bargains of the Democracy, Thompson wrote: "Well might the British Parliament

            <p>The South and the Indiana Democrats at least seemed to be treading on common ground on the tariff.
                    Unfortunately, on the other issues of conflict, the dilemma was not so easily resolved. The free
                    movement of agricultural products required rivers and harbors as well as favorable tariffs. It was
                    at this point that mutual interest ceased to be a binding force drawing the West and the South
                    together.</p>
            <p>Polk's veto of the Eivers and Harbors Bill in August of 1846 was a bitter blow to the
                    Northwest. It had been disappointed before, but since the days of the campaign of 1844 there had
                    been the feeling that the South and West could ameliorate sectional differences of opinion. The <placeName>

                    the Constitution, and the expectation of lower hurdles in the House and Senate had stimulated in the
                    Northwest a greater hope of settlement.</p>
            <p>Indiana had its interest in internal improvements as did the rest of the section, even though its
                    geography made her self-development less urgent. The federal government had spent enough funds in
                    Indiana to begin several projects; the problem now was to complete them. The river interests were

                    spent, the work was not complete, and the timbers of the project rotted away while politicians

                    the General Assembly that there were over sixty thousand dollars of exports each year through this
                    lake port, in spite of the fact that prior to improvement, a rowboat often could not get into the

            <p>The southern reluctance to give its legislative support in the improvement of western rivers and
                    harbors nurtured in the Northwest continued distrust of its neighbors. The bill of 1846 was of large
                    proportions, filled with provisions that were targets for the cries of porkbarrel legislation.
                    Pettit of Indiana was the only congressman from that state who spoke on the subject of rivers and
                    harbors legislation, and it was he who made the threat to the South that the tariff would not be
                    supported by the Northwest unless appropriations were made for internal improvements. The <placeName>

            <p>It is not surprising, then, that the veto message of President Polk generated a storm of protest in
                    the Northwest. Owen and Wick, however, declined to override the veto; in fact, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Democrat had voted against the bill just as he had against all others based on a strict
                    constructionist stand. When John Wentworth and Wick were debating on the floor of the House some
                    months later, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Democrat reminded Wick of this failure to support the interests of the Northwest.
                    Lumping together the political misdoings of Wick as he saw them, Wentworth accused Wick of back
                    tracking to the administration point of view after voting for the Harbor Bill. Furthermore, he said,
                    Wick had changed his position on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> and left the 54" 40' camp to support the administration compromise.
                    He had supported the tea and coffee provisions of the tariff and changed his stand on rivers and
                    harbors. Wentworth, who was now convinced that the southern leaders were attempting to rule the
                    nation in order to maintain their peculiar institutions castigated all men such as Wick who boldly
                    followed the Polk administration. How could Wick explain his apparent lack of sectional interest?</p>
            <p>The Hoosier politician replied that his constituents had sent him to Congress to carry out executive
                    policy, and furthermore, his position was clear on each of the issues under attack. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> question was now dead and past. As for the coffee and tea tax, it was merely a
                    temporary measure to finance the Mexican War, and like any direct tax, he declared, it would fall
                    hardest on the laborers of the North. Concerning the Harbors Bill, when he had found out that this
                    measure would put harbors where God had not intended them, he had supported the
                    President's veto.</p>
            <p>The Democrats of the Northwest were beginning to establish loyalty checks on their fellow party
                    members. Collectively, the support given each measure in Congress spotlighted the faction to which
                    each House member belonged. Those who supported the Polk administration became, in the eyes of the
                    insurgents, mere tools of the southern politicians, whereas northwestern Democrats opposed to the
                    President were evolving into a new species of Democrats.</p>
            <p>Although Indiana party members opposed the President's policy, they apparently did not see
                    fit to rise up in wild protests comparable to those of the neighbors of the Northwest. The Upper
                    West was breaking away from the Lower, as Hubbart <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-048-3-051"/> has pointed
                    out, to make a section within a section,<hi rend="sup">17</hi> but the political manifestations of
                    this process were not clear-cut in Indiana, probably because the Hoosiers did not have the factors
                    present in an appreciable quantity that would tend to create a strong upper West.</p>

                    told his constituents that no appropriations could be expected during the present administration,
                    for there was little chance that a two-thirds vote could be secured. He suggested this remedy:

            <p>The Wilmot Proviso by bringing into the political arena a new ingredient—the expansion of
                    slavery—tested the versatility of the Hoosier politician. Limited by experience and the
                    will of his constituents, he was forced to rummage through his political baggage to find the proper
                    political adhesive to apply to this new crack in the party structure.</p>
            <p>The average Hoosier was not very hospitable to abolitionism, with the result that the movement took
                    root slowly and only in particular localities. The Quakers of the Whitewater Valley offered perhaps
                    the most fertile field of endeavor. In 1839, the Friends of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> had organized an Anti-Slavery Library Society. One of the Friends, Levi Coffin, had
                    been aiding fugitive slaves for years, having begun the task in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a charter member of William L. Garrison's society in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, had lived with the Coffins while lecturing on the subject of abolitionism.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The turn that abolitionism had taken was giving the Friends in Indiana cause
                    for alarm. The Yearly Meeting in 1841 had warned against opening meeting houses for anti-slavery
                    meetings, and the following year several Friends were "disqualified" for
                    usefulness in the body presumably for anti-slavery activity. Benjamin Stanton, who edited the <hi rend="i">Free Labor Advocate</hi>, and Charles Osborn, one of the most famous of the
                    abolitionists, were among those who were asked to leave.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> In 1843, the Society
                    went on record warning its members not to join antislavery societies. Thus the Friends were

                    whole, perhaps the largest denomination in the state, was not yet ready to follow the extremists. If
                    it can be interpreted as a reflection of the opinion of its members, the attitude of the majority of
                    its leaders was much like that of the Hoosier politicians who took the position that the Northwest
                    had a special role to play as a great middle force in the Union. The church and state, although
                    separated, were nevertheless influenced by the same social forces. In 1844, when the Methodist
                    church was brought face to face with the question of secession induced by the stumbling block of
                    slavery, the Indiana Conference of the church deplored the action of the national body. In
                    resolutions adopted by the Northern Indiana Conference, it declared that "we do in fear of
                    God protest against all efforts by whatever source proceeding, to divide the Methodist Episcopal

                    outside the tenets of the church, the North Indiana Conference by a vote of 60 to 2 refused to
                    concur. At the same session, an agent of the colonization society attempted to address tiie
                    conference, but he was stopped by some members who were determined not to arouse any excitement on
                    the subject of slavery. Later, the conference voted to hear him, but the speaker declined to

            <p>These men of the church were not proslavery-minded; like their brother politicians, they were merely
                    attempting to place themselves between the extremes. As practical men, they prided themselves that
                    this was the western approach to action. The future middle ground stand of the politician had a
                    forerunner in the actions of the church leaders of 1844. While at the Convention of Southern

                    leader. Quakers and Methodists alike were finding that the slavery question complicated church
                    structure and undoubtedly slowed down the spirit of the church in its mission, but Hoosier churchmen
                    were reluctant for the most part to take a stand on either side of the controversy.</p>
            <p>The attitudes of the Hoosier laymen toward the Negro also contributed to the political climate
                    typical of Indiana. The legal framework of the state placed very definite restrictions on the Negro.
                    He was treated as a vagrant in most localities. In the constitution of 1816, the only restriction
                    placed upon the Negro was that he could not vote or serve in the militia. In the same year,
                    legislative permission was asked to settle a group of emancipated slaves in the state; the committee
                    of the legislature to which the request was referred replied that it "would be impolitic to
                    sanction by any special act of the general assembly the admission of emancipated Africans into this
                    state; the reasons are that the Negroes being a distinct species, insuperable objections exist to
                    their participation in the rights of suffrage, representation in government or alliance by marriage,
                    and that in consequence, they could never feel themselves completely free."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The citizens of Indiana took pride in the adjective "free," giving it a wide
                    connotation. It was applied to labor, the West, and the people. Occupied with local problems and the
                    business of establishing themselves, the agrarian desire to be left alone, whether it be from
                    taxation, reformers, free education, or meddling neighbors, was very evident. The farmers were not
                    particularly concerned over slavery—they just did not like Negroes, slave or free.
                    William W. Wick seemingly did not exaggerate the feeling of many when he said: "We have our
                    antipathies in Indiana; but they are not local antipathies. I will name three of them …
                    they are abolitionism, free-niggerism, and slavery."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    abolition meeting was not a lawful assemblage, peaceably assembled for a lawful purpose. The members
                    of the jury considered themselves as the judges of the law and the evidence. It must be noted,
                    however, that this verdict was not universally accepted, for one editor wrote: "If it
                    should be sustained, it would establish a <hi rend="i">white</hi> slavery much worse than any black

            <p>Indiana politicians had not been troubled to any great extent by the politically inclined antislavery
                    groups. The Liberty party had run a slate in the state election of 1843, with Elizur Deming and
                    Stephen S. Harding, both capable men, as its candidates, but it had not been able to garner any more
                    than twenty-six hundred votes. The canvass for James G. Birney in 1844 had been of no special
                    significance, either.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> In the major parties, politicians, always willing to use
                    expediency in appealing to voters, were not hesitant to play on the local attitudes in order to gain
                    an extra pocketful of antislavery votes. This could mean anything from making a diversion with the
                    Liberty party to employing such devices as one Whig suggested when he wrote: "It might not
                    be amiss to tell the folks that Joe Marshall [Whig candidate for governor] had a considerable
                    patrimony in <hi rend="i">slaves</hi> left him—all of whom he has emancipated &amp;

            <p>Indiana politicians, despite these few flirtations, were unwilling to relax the laws of the state
                    dealing with the Negro. In 1841–1842, when a bill was put before the legislature
                    providing that fugitives be given jury trials and be allowed to testify in court, Hannegan, then a
                    member of the state legislature, protested "the presumption of negro virtue." A
                    law of 1831 that had required Negroes to give bond of five hundred dollars for their good behavior
                    before receiving permission to settle in the state was also under fire, and Hannegan asked his <list type="footnotes">

                    deplored abolitionism, the former, at least before the storm broke over the Wilmot Proviso, gave
                    tacit approval to his neighboring slaveholders. In March, 1845, Hannegan criticized the New
                    Englanders in the Senate who were complaining of the southern laws regarding the Negro. Indiana, he
                    declared: "lay side by side of <placeName>

                    and expansion into one basket and handed it to an already disgruntled Congress.</p>

            <p>Early in 1847, the congressmen of Indiana began to air their views as to slavery in general and the
                    proviso in particular, using much the same treatment everywhere. They were reluctant to take any
                    extreme position. John Pettit of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who felt called upon to explain his actions, gave two reasons for voting for the
                    proviso: first, to make the appropriations bill so odious to the South that its congressmen would
                    vote it down; second, "because it was my firm, well-settled, and conscientious opinion that
                    we ought not, under any circumstances, to allow what I conceive to be a moral, political and
                    physical evil, to be extended under the authority of this government." But Pettit did not
                    want to be misunderstood. "I've no sickly sympathy with the negro. …
                    I believe that it [slavery] is a blessing to the entire black population."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A few days later, Wick expressed his views of the proviso in terms of the party. Wick's
                    criterion for judging every practice was to test its merits in relation to the Democratic party. He
                    was frequently engaged, it seems, in acting as a self-appointed party whip to remind his colleagues
                    of the necessity for party unity. He took this occasion to deplore the impracticability of the
                    Democratic majority in the House, with a speech that exemplified the western desire to act in the
                    Democratic mechanism as the great balance wheel over-riding sectional friction. His observations
                    were typical of those who were unwilling to recognize any disruptive forces that would strain the
                    national unity of the party and who religiously preached the central themes of party loyalty and
                    practical politics. Wick castigated the rising factional spirit thus: "Perhaps some of that
                    majority are but half-baked Democrats —need grinding over again. To this may be added a
                    little individual ambition disappointed. State feuds and factious jealousy may come in for a share,
                    and President-making in 1848 operates, mayhap, to clog the wheels. Such things I leave to be
                    reproved and punished by the people, posterity, history, and God. Sometimes it seems to me as if
                    some of us forget that we are members of one great firm, each bound to exert himself for the common
                    account; and that there is a kind of peddling in small wares—such as Abolitionism and
                    Nullification, for instance—on individual account. It was but the other day that we
                    contrived to get up a tempest in a teapot on the subject of the kind of municipal laws to be
                    established in the territory <list type="footnotes">

                    to a certainty that wisdom will die with this Congress, and that no subsequent Congress will have
                    the temerity to overset matters of our ordaining…. Hereupon, some of our southern
                    friends, feeling that they have as good a right, and as good a will, to expand themselves
                    … made this Hall ring with threats of disunion and secession—threats from

            <p>"The result seems to be that the Democratic party in this Hall is incapable of united
                    action, more because of certain local and personal peculiar idiosyncracies, which the owners nurse
                    as the nurseryman nurses his vegetable pots, from habit, rather than any rational preference, or
                    respect for them."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hannegan in the Senate treated the proviso in much the same manner as Wick, as if it were a mere
                    disturber of the peace. There was time enough, according to the Senator, to talk of slavery when the
                    new territory gained from the Mexican War was actually part of the Union.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Robert Dale Owen also preferred to support an appropriation bill without the nuisance of considering
                    an antislavery proviso. Owen claimed that it was only common sense to vote against "a
                    clause, which every one knew must, if persisted in, defeat it; no matter how much opposed that man
                    might be to domestic institutions, which the progress of improvement must soon sweep
                        away."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

            <p>These legislators of Indiana represented the feeling of their constituents in several ways. They were
                    puzzled in the sense that they could not comprehend any political sagacity in bringing slavery into
                    the party battles, remembering that the Liberty party had not been able to throw a scare into the
                    politicians of the old parties in Indiana. Yet they were reluctant to take a stand against the
                    slavery question and thereby lose a degree of availability. Their middle ground position was
                    becoming more hazardous for it was increasingly difficult to stand on the plateau of neutrality and
                    watch it slowly crumb <list type="footnotes">

                    cross currents. When Wick and his colleagues attempted to castigate wavering Democrats, they found
                    their weapons were rather limited, so they centered their arguments around blind loyalty to party.
                    The solution, however, was not as simple as that; political tongue-lashings were not enough to
                    restore complete accord because party unity, per se, did not change the social and economic
                    realities of the growing sectionalism of the nation. It was more comfortable for the party stalwarts
                    of Indiana to assume the role of purveyors of expediency than for Democrats like John Wentworth of <placeName>

                    concerning the extension of the institution of slavery, prefacing its remarks with the inevitable
                    disarming introduction: "None can be more opposed to the principle of slavery than we are;
                    none would rejoice more than in the triumph of Northern principles in the settling of this question,
                    but so far as the practical effect of the prohibition of slavery in the newly acquired territory is
                    concerned, we have good authority—Whig authority—for saying that it is of but
                    little moment. Slavery cannot be made profitable there; and when it ceases to be profitable, it will

            <p>Lewis Cass did not attend the convention, and his explanation for his absence occasioned the Whig
                    comment that Cass could not support his section on improvements without turning a "cold

            <p>After the convention ended, and the election took place, it was disclosed that the convention had had

                    expediency on any vote concerning territory where it already existed; and he favored the Wilmot
                    Proviso. The <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> was quick to accuse the <placeName>

            <p>The war issue was a popular bludgeon for other Whigs. Although Elisha Embree used practically all of
                    the mud slinging tactics available to him in an effort to defeat Robert Dale Owen, it was really the <placeName>

            <p>Doubts were expressed by even a few Democrats as to whether the Mexican War had real support in
                    Indiana. John Law, friend and correspondent of Martin Van Buren, wrote during the summer of 1847:
                    "The Truth is the Mexican War is not popular in the thinking and reflecting majority of our
                    party…. Who wins? and though we are very conservative sort of people—we want
                    no addition of slave states."<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The canvass did not result in a clear mandate on these issues—it merely indicated that the
                    "New Democracy" of 1843 had lost some of its momentum at an inopportune time, the
                    eve of a presidential election. The Whigs had gained two seats in the House of Representatives, and
                    the state-wide popular vote showed increasing Whig strength in Indiana. There were issues present
                    that required solution, and no solutions were foreseeable. The Mexican War, the slavery question,
                    and internal improvements continued to harrass the politicians of both parties.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Contrasted to the apathy of the Democrats was the activity of the Whigs, who, encouraged by the
                    election results, began to cast about for a presidential hope. One of the early spokesmen for the
                    party summed up the situation thus: "if peace is declared and that peace brings with it a
                    portion of Mexican territory as indemnity we must have a Northern man for our
                    candidate—as the question of slavery will then be presented to the people of this Union

                    The stresses and strains pulling at the Union were not quite as apparent in the Hoosier political

                    </placeName> River from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to Cairo. This was the series of rapids, known as the "Falls,"
                    located a little more than half way along the course of the normally peaceful stream. The obstacle
                    caused much inconvenience to river captains who wished to get their cargo as speedily and safely as
                    possible to its destination. To others who saw their fortunes in the role of middle men, the hazard
                    offered a natural site for a commercial entrepot.</p>
            <p>As early as 1780, the potential worth of the area was sufficiently appreciated for a settlement to
                    cluster on the southern side of the river at the head of the Falls. This was the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, whose establishment resulted from the activities of the Revolutionary warrior George
                    Rogers Clark. On the north, or what was to be the Indiana side of the river, two other settlements
                    formed a few years later: one was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at the head of the Falls; the other, Clarksville, lying along part of the two and a
                    half mile stretch of rapids. Below the Falls there was only the tiny village of Shippingport on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side, and almost an unbroken forest on the northern bank. This latter, or northwest
                    corner of the square formed around the Falls, became the site of New <placeName>

                    </placeName> was to play in the scheme of western transportation and expansion was still largely in
                    the blueprint stage. Already the river served as a vital connecting link to the area farther west,
                    having been traveled for many years by canoes, keelboats, barges, and flatboats. But its true value
                    was not to be realized until there was something besides the port of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the East to be connected to. And building a town anywhere along the six hundred
                    fifty-mile stretch was something of a gamble. As a terminus the new town might
                    "boom," then be passed by as a mere way station when a more suitable point down
                    the line became favored.</p>

                    Settlements already having been established on all the other key points around the Falls, their eyes
                    were attracted to the one remaining spot on the Indiana shore at the lower end of the rapids.</p>
            <p>The Scribners were not the first to see that this section of the northern bank was valuable. They

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> had given the entire region on the northern side along the Falls to General Clark as a

                    thousand acres, had in turn been divided among his followers. The spot which the Scribners coveted
                    was within the grant and belonged to two of the veterans, Epaphras Jones and a Mr. Whitehill.
                    Failing to purchase this, the next choice of the Scribners was the parcel of land just outside the
                    grant belonging to Colonel John Paul of <placeName>

            <p>In 1811, Joel had formed a partnership with his brother-in-law, William Waring, with whom he planned

                    between Joel and Waring as to whether they should travel on the Sabbath, the trip was made as

                    decided that his best chance to earn a living lay still farther west. Joined by his brothers, Abner
                    and Nathaniel, he started down the river to find a suitable place to support his family and pursue
                    his mercantile ambitions. The search had ended some hundred miles down the stream when the brothers
                    sighted the prosperous village of <placeName>

            <p>The ground purchased by the Scribners for their town was bounded on the south by the river, and on
                    the north and west by a range of hills known as the "Knobs," or "Silver

                    as a source of water power for industrial purposes; but when they were forced to establish the town
                    considerably below the immediate Falls area, they had to settle for what other compensations there
                    were in the bargain. As it turned out, the purchased land met the immediate requirements very well:
                    there were plenty of fresh water springs; a hilly landscape free of the usual "disease
                    infested" lowlands; an abundance of building timber; and at least one small stream, Falling
                    Run Creek, that would serve amply for the scale of milling operations with which they were prepared

                    later New Albanians have delighted in continuing.</p>
            <p>Greenbriers, poplars, birches, and silver maples steadily gave way to the axes of the Scribners until

                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> began to take form. The first tree fell on March 2, 1813, and just two months later
                    Joel had a large double log cabin ready for his family to move into. A surveyor by the name of John
                    Graham wandered in with his family, and he received the distinction of platting the town. Others
                    attracted to the settlement pitched in to cut trees, pile brush, and build cabins. The Scribners
                    shortly began to devote most of their time and energy to the setting up of a steam sawmill.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                    a share of the town plat for the support of a school. The four corners of what was to be one of the
                    major intersections of the town they reserved for public buildings. And they designated a full block
                    for "the Public Promenade and Parade Ground."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>The principal business and residential street running east and west, High Street, or later Main, was
                    platted along high ground over six hundred feet up from the lower bank of the river. It was
                    paralleled on the north by Market, Spring, Elm, and Oak streets. Running east and west along the
                    river was Water Street, designed as the natural avenue for river front activity. Running north and
                    south the principal street was State. It was to serve as the meridian between the
                    "upper" and "lower" sections of the town. The widths of the
                    streets varied according to their expected importance: Water Street was the widest, being one
                    hundred feet; High, Market, and Spring were all eighty feet, while Elm was sixty, and Oak, its
                    significance diminished because of its distance from the river, only thirty feet.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    be reflected in the town for many years to come. When discussing the achievements of pioneers, it is
                    easy to fall into eulogy; but the Scribners were among those worthy of eulogy. Personal faults and

                    the Scribners became noticeably less influential in the activities of the town. Partly from chance
                    accidents, and partly from the competition of more enterprising newcomers, their several milling
                    projects never quite worked out. And despite the large quantity of land they sold to incoming
                    settlers, the town project did not prove to be a successful financial investment for them.
                    Nathaniel's property was sold by his heirs in 1821 for what little it would bring,<hi rend="sup">13</hi> and three years later Joel's was sold to satisfy his creditors

            <p>The "Minutes" of the County Council of Floyd are available from 1819 through the
                    next ten years, and the petty details which concerned the county commissioners sufficiently indicate
                    the scale of the early government. The general run of business had to do with the appointing of
                    jurors, overseers of the poor, inspectors for projected roads, and tax collectors; or with the
                    licensing of ferryboatmen and tavern keepers. The men who governed were familiar with the tradition
                    of good government, but not with the administrative details that must be worked out to make it run
                    smoothly. Trial and error was the most popular formula.</p>
            <p>Finding a suitable place to hold the meetings of the County Council was in itself a problem; the
                    commissioners met sometimes at Seth Woodruff's tavern, sometimes at the Presbyterian
                    church, and sometimes at Sheriff James Besse's office. A courthouse was planned, the
                    designer having received ten dollars for his share in the project, but it was offered for sale
                    before completion. In 1822, another building was projected at a cost of nine thousand dollars, and
                    the confusion resulting from this project was in part responsible for the threatened removal of the
                    county government from the town of New <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> men, were apathetic in their governing duties and had the tendency to let matters ride
                    until they almost got out of hand. Perhaps the real significance of the dispute lies in the fact
                    that New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s river position was not yet sufficiently honored to give it uncontested
                    predominance over the interior towns.</p>
            <p>Expenses for running the various governments which held jurisdiction over the settlement at New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> were not great, but there were taxes and all the problems accompanying their levy and
                    collection. In addition to the poll tax of fifty cents, the assessors levied chiefly on land,
                    chattels, and personal luxuries. In 1819, the state land taxes were "For every one hundred
                    acres of first rate land one dollar, for every one hundred acres of second rate land Eighty seven
                    and a half cents, and for every acre of third rate land Sixty two &amp; a half cents."
                    County taxes at the same time were 50 cents for first rate land, 43 3/4 cents for second, and 31 1/4
                    for third.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> It is conceivable that there were times when owner and assessor
                    differed as to what was first, second, and third rate.</p>
            <p>Holders of town lots paid 50 cents on each one hundred dollar valuation, while an owner of a horse
                    paid 37 1/2 cents for this privilege. Tavern keepers received licenses for fifteen or twenty
                    dollars, and ferryboatmen for five to twenty dollars. Servants were strictly luxuries. "For
                    every body servant above the age of twelve years other than an apprentice, three
                        dollars."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1823 and 1824 the county commissioners found new items to tax. "One dollar and twenty
                    five cents on each pleasure carriage of four wheels—One dollar on each pleasure carriage
                    of Two wheels—Fifty cents on each Gold Watch—Twenty five cents on each Silver
                    watch and twenty five cents on each work ox over 3 yr old. … On each Brass Clock one

            <p>Total county taxes for 1819 amounted to $803.29, while licenses and fees brought in another $251.11
                    1/4. Many of the citizens were land-poor, for there were forty-three on the 1821 list of delinquent
                    county taxes, and twenty more for town levies. Mistakes in bookkeeping were patiently rectified.
                    When Frederick Leatherman was assessed for a horse he did not own, he protested and was refunded 37

            <p>Typical of the men who came to the forefront in the town as the Scribners faded out of the picture
                    were Seth Woodruff and Charles Paxson. Woodruff had the versatility so often associated with leaders
                    in frontier communities. He was a magistrate, tavern keeper, harness seller, bricklayer, and Baptist
                    preacher. His prominence is verified by the number of times his name appears in the county records.
                    He was energetic and economical, and had little appreciation for those who were otherwise. One of
                    his favorite practices was to donate glass for new church windows—if the members of the
                    congregations agreed to give up tobacco for one year. He boasted that he furnished them with all the
                    light they had. Seth was just the sort of fellow to add plenty of zest and occasional turmoil to the
                    newly established community. To his fellow citizens he was customarily known as
                    "Judge." In later years he was revered as "Father Woodruff."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    </placeName>, was a merchant-miller who succeeded in the very ventures in which the Scribners
                    failed. By 1819 he had his own steamboat, the "<placeName>

                    of Morris Birkbeck, his friend, George Flower, and Flower's cousin, Elias Pym Fordham.
                    They traveled through the southern part of the territory in 1817 and 1818, as Birkbeck related in

            <p>Another Englishman, a self-styled "farmer," named William Faux who came to this
                    same territory in 1819, also wrote in his book, <hi rend="i">Memorable Days in America</hi>, about

                    Saunders Hornbrook, Charles Phillips, James Maidlow and others who had settled in the neighborhood.</p>

                        law: "25 cents for a meal, 12 1/2 for bed and 12 1/2 cents for horsekeep over
                        night." But a note on the fly-leaf of the Ledger warns that "Boarding was rose

                    <p>There is no picture extant of the Tavern; it stood on the southwest corner of the Courthouse

                        a two-story log structure, with a one-story annex or ell, containing the dining room which
                        served on occasion as a ballroom. Balls were given here at frequent intervals, the first one in
                        the Ledger being that held on December 25, 1818; it was always referred to as the "Ball
                        on 25th December," never as the "Christmas Dance." In fact, the word
                        Christmas only occurred once in the three volumes; that was when in 1817 Dr. Joel F. Casey
                        bought "two small books for Christmas gifts, 50 cents." In 1815 the store did
                        a good business on December 25:</p>

                    <p>The ball on December 25, 1818, was not the first one, however; some of the participants were
                        still paying for the one held in February of 1817, and in 1819 there were balls on March 17, May
                        4, July 6, and December 28, and at least as many in the years following. It was possible to tell
                        from the Ledger just who went to each ball, and how much it cost him; the amounts paid to
                        "Ball Club" or to "Club at Ball" vary from $1.50 to $4.00 or
                        $4.50 or $6.62 1/2, a large sum to squander on one evening's entertainment,
                        considering the cost of other things; house rent for 1 month, $5.00, for instance.</p>
                    <p>Conspicuous among those who went to almost every ball are the young bachelors who boarded at the
                        Tavern, professional men mostly, such as Dr. Foster, Dr. Waters, and Dr. Joel Casey, whose bills
                        for medical attendance came to light in Jones and Stockwell's books. Dr. Casey bought
                        the best of men's wear from them, "fine vest patern and trimmings, 2.50
                        great coat, $30.00, superfine crevat, $2.50" and frequently replenished his stock of

                        Jones, occasionally. In 1816 the partners each paid into the firm the sum of.75 for
                        "Fandango," which the dictionary defines as a term once used in the Middle
                        West for a "noisy frolic"; in March 1817, Stockwell fined Jones 50 cents for
                        "profane swearing" and apparently they were not too compatible, for on May 7,
                        1820, the partnership was dissolved, Jones went into the wholesale business with other men
                        (Jones, Harrison, Jones and Chandler) in 1822, and Stockwell carried on alone.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    <p>Robert Stockwell, about the same time, bought "1 sword 18.00 1 Appulet 10.00, 1 Belt
                        8.00 Add 20 pr ct 7.20;" totals 43.20. Johnson FitzJerauld bought 1 sword belt for
                        $16.00, to be paid in 60 days. On the same date General W. Johnston bought a keg of oysters for
                        $6.00, while Basil Brown bought not only a keg of oysters for $5.00 but 1 1/4 box of
                        "segars" for $4.50.</p>
                    <p>What all this finery was for does not appear: it was a little early for his admirers to be
                        preparing for the dinner proffered to General Harrison, for that did not take place until June
                        9, 1821. It cost $1.25 a plate and according to the Tavern records, there were fifty-six guests.
                        General Harrison was not very popular at this time; he was much criticized for having made his
                        son land agent at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                        </placeName>, and naturally the son was criticized for the way he managed the office; but <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                        </placeName> could not forget the war with Tecumseh, and their old commander, so the dinner was,
                        in effect, a vindication of him. One man, at least, made money out of it; Andrew Ralston
                        received $1.37 1/2 for shoeing the General's horse.</p>
                    <p>In contrast to all this frivolity, Jones and Stockwell's books show a more serious,
                        not to say philanthropic side; many Bibles were bought, from a 75 cent pocket Testament to a 12
                        dollar Family Bible as well as many volumes of sermons, and hymnbooks, though history was
                        equally popular (Benedict's History, 7.50, History of War, 3.00, Life of General <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Putnam</settlement>
                        </placeName>, Life of Patrick Henry, 4.50, Ancient and Modern History, 2.00,
                        Plutarch's Lives, 9.25, Life of Nelson, many copies of the Life of Napoleon sold in
                        1818, and so on); a chapter could be written on the subject. There is charity, too; $2.00 paid
                        to Parson Kell; 12 1/2 to camp meeting, $10 "subscription to Widow Hickman."
                        Widow Leathers aroused a special sympathy; her young husband had died one hot August day after a
                        prolonged fight which had started with an argument with an equally strong young neighbor. In
                        December of the same year (1819) Basil Brown bought 1 pair 1 "pint" blankets
                        $3.75 for Widow Leathers; Robert Milburn bought "3 yards domestic cotton
                        $1.25" for the widow. And Judge David Hart gave her a subscription of $2.50. A knife
                        was bought by Jas. K. Sloan for Old Daniel; a "shall" was bought for Old Ann.
                        In short, another chapter could be written about the colored people: Lucy, "yellow
                        woman," bought a dictionary for $1.50; Black Rachel, an "ombrilla"
                        for $4.50.</p>
                    <p>Although the court records show many marriage licenses issued during this ten-year period, no
                        hint of them crept out in the ledgers, except when one knew the date of a wedding, he would find
                        that the groom as well as the bride bought new clothes about that time. There were, however,
                        many indications of sickness and death; "Barks for Mother," "Bottle
                        of Bitters"; "Antinomial Wine"; bottle of
                        "Nature's Grand Restorative" as well as "1/4 dozen coffin
                        screws 12 1/2, 5 yds Cambrick for <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-048-3-082"/> shroud, 4.50, 6 yds cambk

                        Margarette, 4.25." All of these were especially frequent in the terrible summer of
                        1822.</p>
                    <p>In spite of these periods of trial and sorrow, the general atmosphere of the community was one of
                        gay courage: there were very few stern and rock-bound people here; most of the inhabitants were
                        young and found life a joyous adventure.</p>
                    <p>It was into such a typically American scene that Morris Birkbeck and his party came in July,
                        1817. They went to Brown 's Tavern and continued to board there while occupying their
                        rented house. On February 21, 1818, Birkbeck paid through Jones and Stockwell his Tavern bill to
                        date, $394.41 and other payments were made later. The party consisted of Birkbeck, 54, his two
                        sons, Bradford, 16, and Charles, 14; his daughters, Eliza, 19, and Prudence, 16. In addition,
                        were Elizabeth Garton, an orphan-servant girl and another servant "Gillard."
                        Elias Pym Fordham, 29, was also with them, but George Flower, 29, and his bride, the former
                        Eliza Julia Andrews, 25, were not They had been married in <placeName>

                    <p>The story of this marriage and the consequent quarrel and prolonged estrangement that followed it
                        have been related by others and need not be dwelt on here. If it is true that the warfare
                        between the two men was due to Birkbeck's resentment of the fact that Miss Andrews
                        had refused his offer of marriage, only to accept that of George Flower a little later, it was
                        not apparent at the time; the affront, if any, was glossed over and it was not until the
                        following year on Flower's return from <placeName>

                        and Stockwell show that Eliza Birkbeck and Mrs. Flower went across the street, shopping together
                        on July 23, 1817, and Mrs. Flower charged to her husband</p>

                    <p>Also to be noted; cost price of articles was given in shillings and pence, with plenty of

                        19, 1819); but the selling price was given in dollars and cents; this method continued in Jones
                        and Stockwells books until 1821, when both were in the decimal system. The bookkeeper had
                        difficulty with it though, and often reverted to the old way. 4$ was the order often used and

                    <p>September 24, 1818, Birkbeck per order was charged with "merchandise paid to George
                        Flower per bill, $24.50 and for barrel containing hardware.37 1/2."</p>
                    <p>"October 12, 1818 George Flower to cash paid Brownlee for apples Dr. 8.00 and for a

                    <p>May 4,1819, A final charge was made for Postage paid Neely $2.75.</p>
                    <p>George Flower's name did not appear on the Tavern register, though the bill for 394.41
                        due Brown to February 21, 1819 probably included Flower's expenses during the time
                        they were there.</p>
                    <p>After the Flowers departed, Birkbeck's account continued active throughout the fall
                        and winter, though for the most part the purchases were made per son Bradford or daughter Eliza
                        and the items were not particularly interesting; sugar, tallow, candle moulds, shovel and tongs,
                        writing paper and paper; he pays 4.93 3/4 for 44 1/4 lbs "pot mettle" and
                        "handage" for same; 4.50 for 2 pairs coarse shoes, 1.00 for hat cover and per
                        Stewart (a tailor) cloth, flannel and trimmings and draws various amounts of cash for himself
                        and per Fordham. The store in fact served its customers as a bank; the great scarcity of money
                        at the time led to the balancing of one account against another, which in turn provided detailed
                        information about each transaction. In only a few instances was a bill paid in specie, or in
                        silver, and only once or twice in gold; drafts on most banks were honored only for much less
                        than their face value; <placeName>

                    <p>In December, 1817, Birkbeck paid Tweedale, a farmer $80.00, and $3.00 more for hauling; and he
                        paid Mrs. Cushman $35.25 for sewing. This last item was rather large; a seamstress got only one
                        dollar for making a shirt; 50 cents for a flannel one; and it shows that whatever the Birkbeck
                        ladies had been doing during the summer, they had not spent all their time making up the yards
                        of material they had bought in July.</p>
                    <p>January 1, 1818 Mr. Birkbeck started the New Year by paying "6.00 for
                        Intelligencer." January 5, he drew $50.00 to buy Pork; also 30.00 and 20.00, purpose
                        unspecified.</p>
                    <p>January 12 He made per Brown a "subscription, 10.00 to Mrs. Hickman" (widow).
                        And January 15 he was charged with Cash at Shawneetown $16.00; he bought a hat (made at Milburn
                        and Sturgis) for $3.00 for Giliard and a slate for 87 1/2 "for do." January
                        17, he paid Cushman $5.00 (more sewing) and bought 100 "segars" for.50.</p>

                        may have been for the wedding punch and La Serre could have brought his own wine. On October 2
                        La Serre bought a tea pot for $4.50 (it would now be called a tea set) and on October 5, 2 lbs
                        Coffee "first charged to Fordham." No more items "per
                        sister" were charged to Fordham after September, 1821, though his account continued
                        active until late in 1822. The first charge to La Serre "per Lady" was on
                        October 22, 1821, and entries in his name continued until the last date in
                        Stockwell's book, May 8, 1824. On the flyleaf was written "Commenced keeping
                        my horse with La Serre, Oct 6, 1823 at 75 cts a week." No information as to the date of
                        the wedding can be gleaned from the Tavern Ledger for La Serre's account there began
                        in January, 1822.</p>

            <p>This book is a sequel to the same author's <hi rend="i">Foreigners in the
                    Confederacy</hi>. Together they show how many pages are needed for a comprehensive treatment of what
                    might seem to some a minor question.</p>
            <p>The decades preceding the Civil War had seen a great immigration into the northern states, the
                    1850's having been especially notable for the influx of Germans and Irish. Miss Lonn
                    begins her book with a well-balanced and interesting treatment of the foreign population in the
                    North in 1860, based upon the census for that year. The figures will probably surprise most readers.
                    More persons had come from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, and from <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> than is generally supposed, while no less than ten minor groups had begun to arrive.</p>
            <p>How did the great multitude of foreigners react to the crisis that finally led to the outbreak of
                    civil war in the country to which they had come? The question makes the theme of the second chapter,
                    and it is answered largely by an appeal to the foreign press, especially the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> papers. Although there was a notable drift toward the new Republican party, in spite of
                    the fact that it contained antiforeign persons formerly in the Know-Nothing party, there was not an
                        <hi rend="i">en masse</hi> desertion of the Democratic party. Copperheads in fact soon appeared
                    among the Germans quite as well as among the native born. Nevertheless, the <hi rend="i">Washingtoner Intelligenzblatt</hi> charged that native Americans did not fully appreciate their
                    country, and said, "They do not understand free institutions, because to them the
                    difference between freedom and despotism is unknown. To us immigrants it is reserved to save this
                    land from destruction. And we will do it!"</p>
            <p>Miss Lonn finds that the leaders of the foreign groups were actuated by a great variety of motives.
                    Many Germans were opposed to states' rights, fearing that the principles would lead to
                    the breaking up of the Union into a number of rival countries, such as they had known in central
                    Europe. Others felt slavery was a reflection on a country dedicated to freedom. A Canadian on his

                    sense of gratitude for the opportunities they had been given in their new home, for immigrants had
                    felt a welcome even during the decade of the Know-Nothings. The spirit of adventure was not lacking,
                    and some Turner societies enlisted in a body. A spirit of rivalry developed between different
                    nationalities, and it was urged that men could show the superiority of their racial qualities by
                    loyalty to their new country. Mercenary motives also intruded; there was a bounty for enlistment, in
                    addition to the pay, food, and clothing—and the opportunity for travel. With some
                    leaders, ambition played a part, for a man who raised a regiment for the Union cause was potentially
                    started on a career which would not otherwise have been readily open to him. But so far as the men
                    in the ranks were concerned, Miss Lonn concludes, "Probably the motive which usually swayed
                    the common soldier among the foreigners as a whole was the desire to extirpate slavery; this gave
                    the struggle a moral aspect and turned the war in a sense into a holy crusade. The contact of the
                    foreign-born soldier with slavery during the war only deepened his feeling against it."</p>
            <p>After discussing the largely <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Irish character of the regular army that numbered some fifteen thousand enlisted
                    men in 1861, Miss Lonn considers in detail the foreign-born volunteer units, and then passes to the
                    foreign-born generals, colonels, lower officers, knights-errant, and soldiers of fortune. Many
                    sources had to be drawn upon and the chapters make an important and authoritative contribution to
                    Civil War literature, as does also the one devoted to the special services.</p>
            <p>It was natural that different nationalities should carry their characteristics into the service, and
                    manifest them in military behavior, in recreations, and in food and drink. The Germans could not
                    soldier without beer, and Miss Lonn writes: "The sutler of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> regiment was expected to achieve the impossible in order to supply lager, Rhine wine,
                    and bologna. Whenever he appeared with a fresh stock of these goods, the crowd around his tent
                    gathered in numbers greater than those at a parade of that regiment. Naturally, the other regiments
                    regarded the presence of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> regiment in the brigade as highly desirable." The Irish went in for
                    theatricals and steeplechases, while the Swiss seemed satisfied with sharpshooting contests, where
                    the winners were <pb n="313" id="VAA4025-048-3-101"/> rewarded modest trophies. The Scandinavians
                    were distressed over the absence of brandy, and only reluctantly settled for smoking and chewing
                    tobacco.</p>
            <p>Immigration continued heavily during the war and many citizens of foreign countries entered the Union
                    army and navy. In June of 1864, Secretary of State Seward replied to an inquiry by the Senate as to
                    whether the government was engaged in illegal procedures in the matter of forwarding enlistment.
                    Most of the immigrants, Seward insisted, went immediately into industry, while some voluntarily
                    entered service, the Secretary saying "There is no law of nations and no principle of
                    international comity which requires us to refuse their aid in the cause of the country and of
                    humanity." Miss Lonn writes a penetrating chapter "to test the exact accuracy of
                    these statements made by Seward." There was unquestionably some actual recruiting done
                    abroad, but Miss Lonn states that "Seward was careful to stay within the bound of
                    international law," and that it is unthinkable that he and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> countenanced the practice of some unscrupulous agents representing "fictitious
                    firms or associations" that induced immigrants to come to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The chapter concludes with the statement that "the Federal government
                    enlisted in its army nothing comparable to the foreign legion organized by <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> on the Continent for the Crimean War."</p>
            <p>The ministers of most European countries complained of kidnapping and browbeating, the greatest
                    number of complaints having to do "with the luring of Canadians across the border by false
                    promises of work at high wages." Considerable friction with the British government was
                    caused by the army order which provided that a minor who had enlisted without the consent of his
                    parents or guardian would not be discharged if the parents or guardians were not domiciled in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Lord Lyons, the British Ambassador, received many distressing letters on this subject,
                    and some parents made a long trip to bring additional pressure for the discharge of a son. The
                    ambassador admitted later that discharges were given in all cases where sufficient evidence was
                    furnished. After her full examination of the draft and abuses in recruitment, convincing on account
                    of the multitude of specific cases discussed, Miss Lonn sets down the conclusion:
                    "Foreigners who were enticed, kidnapped, or bludgeoned into the army could hardly make good
                    soldiers. Either they spent their <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-048-3-102"/> time in prison, or they
                    performed their service sullenly or indifferently. Despite all the strenuous efforts of the
                    government and the bounty workers, the conscripts were relatively few. The product secured was
                    clearly not worth the enormous sums expended by the government."</p>
            <p>The inevitable question is: What was the battlefield contribution of the foreign-born? Since units of
                    foreigners were widely distributed, the answering of the question requires an examination of most of
                    the campaigns and the more important battles of the war. Errors and misconceptions are found in this
                    part of the book.</p>
            <p>It is stated that most of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> came into Union hands as a result of the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mill Springs</settlement>
                    </placeName>, fought on January 19, 1862. This is hardly correct, for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mill Springs</settlement>
                    </placeName> was close to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> line, and it was the capture of Fort Henry on February 6 that really caused General
                    Albert <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sidney</settlement>
                    </placeName> Johnston to withdraw from his important position at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bowling Green</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Nor is it true that General George Thomas had moved to the attack on learning that
                    Zollicof f er had crossed the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cumberland</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Mill Springs</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He had been ordered by Buell to drive the Confederates from a position they had
                    occupied for about two months, and General Crittenden, who had recently superseded Zollicoffer in
                    command, moved northward and attacked Thomas when the latter was some ten miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mill Springs</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The bayonet charge of the Ninth <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> regiment (I accept Miss Lonn's statement as to this), was indeed the stroke
                    that precipitated the Confederate rout, but it is not true that the victory "opened the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cumberland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Gap and East <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>." The Confederates were forced to abandon that position on the eighteenth of
                    the following June, by a difficult and skillful maneuver of General George W. Morgan; but no advance
                    was made into East <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. Furthermore, Morgan found it necessary to retire three months later because of
                    Confederate operations, especially those of John H. Morgan, which threatened the Federal
                    communications. It was not until September, 1863, that <placeName>

                    </placeName> Gap was finally secured as a result of Burnside's penetration to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
                    </placeName> by gaps to the south.</p>
            <p>The fine performance of the Thirty-second Indiana at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> is appropriately mentioned, but the impression is left that the regiment belonged to
                    Lew Wallace's division of Grant's army, when it in fact was in
                    McCook's division of Buell's army. Its colonel August Willich (he did not sign
                    his <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-048-3-103"/> report as von Willich which is the style Miss Lonn uses)
                    was not made a brigadier on the field, as she states, and his promotion dated from July 17, 1862,
                    which was three months later.</p>
            <p>The difficult task of treating the foreign-born officers seems in general to have been well
                    accomplished, but dissent can be made to some statements about Franz Sigel, one of the controversial
                    figures of the war. Miss Lonn speaks of his peculiarities and says, "It is difficult to
                    comprehend the exalted position in which his fellow countrymen insisted on placing him. His name
                    lives even yet in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> circles, while one hears almost nothing of the other <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> generals." Miss Lonn herself, however, gives Sigel completely unwarranted
                    credit for the Federal victory at Pea Ridge, and goes much too far in excusing his failure in the
                    Shenandoah Valley. Grant had explicitly told him he did not want him to move farther south than
                    Cedar Creek, and Sigel himself later clearly assumed responsibility for the advance that led to his
                    defeat at New Market on May 15, 1864.</p>
            <p>After a chapter devoted to the "Foreign-born in the Navy," Miss Lonn ends her study
                    with a penetrating chapter which leaves the reader well impressed not only with her ability as a
                    historian but with her skill as an interesting writer. She sets forth how in their service the
                    different racial groups revealed their characteristics, both their weak ones and their strong ones.
                    Her researches have put her in a unique position, for no historian has looked so painstakingly and
                    so objectively at the problems of both sides in the war. When she finished her first book, she
                    marvelled "that the Confederacy could sustain the struggle for four long years."
                    Now with a full grasp of the difficulties that faced the North, she is ready to marvel that it could
                    "sustain the war for four long years to the point of victory." She points to the
                    fact that "on account of the heavy Federal detachments needed to protect the rear against
                    treason at home and to serve on the frontier, the forces <hi rend="i">actually</hi> engaged in fifty
                    important battles were almost equal." The volume closes with a question to which too little
                    attention has been given: "What was the effect of the war on the foreign-born soldier in
                    his relation to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as an American citizen?" There is no simple answer applicable to every case,
                    but Miss Lonn says: "The word 'Americanization' was probably not in
                    common usage by 1865, and yet that process <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-048-3-104"/> is exactly what
                    happened, in greater or less degree, to each foreign-born participant in the war. Friendships
                    between men of differing European races and of foreign-born with American were cemented."
                    Another aspect of the question is answered by the sentence, "All the various racial groups
                    in the population of the North presented to the world a striking and thrilling example of devotion
                    and loyalty to the government which had welcomed the exiles of the world, as well as fidelity to
                    political principles which they had embraced."</p>

                    Ward's public life, beginning with "1756–1765" and
                    continuing through "1765–1767" and
                    "1768–1774." The last division merges into four final pages
                    interestingly concerned with John Dickinson and other public men, the progress of the War, an
                    account of Samuel Ward, Jr., and an appeal for information concerning other letters to or from Ward
                    which Knollenberg believes "have probably survived" but have not been brought to
                    light.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Correspondence</hi> (pp. 37–205) is printed in four sections:
                    "1, May 26, 1775-Aug. 31, 1775"; "2, Sept. 17, 1775-Nov. 2,

                    27, 1776." Ward's letters to his brother Henry (Secretary of <placeName>

            <p>Aspects of Ward's family life, business affairs, religious fervor, and patriotic ardor are
                    revealed through his correspondence with his flock of motherless children (the youngest not yet ten

            <p>Thomas William Rolleston (1857–1920), Irish translator, historian, and biographer, is of
                    interest to Whitman students primarily because he was an early champion of Whitman abroad and
                    published in 1889, with Karl Knortz, an important <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> translation of some poems from <hi rend="i">Leaves of Grass</hi>.</p>
            <p>Most of the present collection of thirty-two letters or cards (twenty-four from Rolleston to Whitman;
                    seven from Whitman to Rolleston; one from J. Fitzgerald Lee to Whitman) is here published for the
                    first time—though four of the Rolleston letters are reprinted from Horace Traubel, <hi rend="i">With Walt Whitman in Camden</hi>, and a part of one Whitman letter has appeared in
                    William Sloane Kennedy, <hi rend="i">The Fight of a Book for the World</hi>. The original of most of
                    the letters Frenz has edited are in the Library of Congress. In point of time, the published
                    correspondence between Rolleston and Whitman runs from October 16, 1880, to 1885 or 1886. In
                    addition to the letters, Frenz reprints as appendixes a summary of a Dresden lecture on Whitman
                    which Rolleston published in the <hi rend="i">Camden Post</hi>, February 13, 1884, and an obituary
                    piece which Rolleston published in the <hi rend="i">Academy</hi> for April 2, 1892, the former to
                    show Rolleston's critical approach to Whitman (favorable, but not without surprising
                    acumen and some reservation), the latter to fill out the "full record of the literary
                    friendship" of Rolleston and Whitman.</p>
            <pb n="319" id="VAA4025-048-3-107"/>
            <p>It detracts nothing from the unique value of Frenz' edition to say at the outset that
                    there is little here of major significance to Whitman scholars. Rather, the collection stands as one
                    more brick, not too significant in itself, but important in the total structure of Whitman
                    bibliography. The majority of the letters are by Rolleston, and thus show more about the Irish
                    scholar than about Whitman—except indirectly. The letters by Whitman are short,
                    perfunctory notes. However, the student of Whitman will be interested in several recurring topics.
                    For example, Rolleston's repeated references to Irish affairs in the early letters, and
                    in particular to the problem of Home Rule, must have intensified Whitman's interest in
                    international affairs.</p>
            <p>In common with several of the early Whitman enthusiasts, Rolleston was keenly aware of the effect of
                    modern science on the poet, and also of the poet's use of modern science. One of the
                    longer letters (Dec. 26, 1882) reports at length the considered opinion of the European authority,
                    Dr. Rudolph Virchow, on Darwinism. A passage from Rolleston's report of one of
                    Virchow's lectures reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>When the theory was first proposed he was not carried off his feet by the waves of enthusiasm
                            about him. He was content to wait, taking the theory for what it was worth, for the proof or
                            disproof which the researches of the next decades (dominated as they have been by the desire
                            to find facts bearing on that theory) would certainly bring.</p>
                    </quote> This passage, and the whole letter, should be compared with
                    "Darwinism—(Then Furthermore)" (<hi rend="i">Complete Works</hi>, V,
                    278–280), where Whitman said that the world will be "Better'd and
                    broaden'd" by Darwinism, but added, with his usual caution on new and
                    "untested" scientific theories, that Darwin's theory, though an
                    important step, would doubtless have to undergo modification in some particulars. This may be seen
                    as further evidence that Whitman's caution did not stem, as some twentieth century
                    critics have made out, from sentimental and soft-minded opposition to evolution, but rather was in
                    keeping with informed scientific opinion, which held in part that Darwin's special
                    contribution, the law of "Natural Selection," was as yet not fully substantiated
                    by scientific research.</p>
            <pb n="320" id="VAA4025-048-3-108"/>
            <p>Other items of interest may be noted. Among the books Rolleston sent to Whitman was a translation of
                        <hi rend="i">Encheiridion</hi>, by Epictetus, which Whitman treasured throughout his life. The
                    recording of the vicissitudes of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> translation, <hi rend="i">Grashalme</hi>, shows again Whitman's fastidious
                    concern with the manner in which his poetry was handled. It was only gradually that Whitman was
                    persuaded not to have the poems printed in parallel texts of English and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Rolleston occasionally sent Whitman some of his own well-meaning but ineffectual
                    Whitmanesque poetry, the reading of which reminds us again that the apparent looseness of
                    Whitman's verse is deceptive, and most difficult to emulate. Again,
                    Rolleston's likening of Whitman's poetry to the music of Wagner and the
                    paintings of Turner (though the former analogy may well seem, to the modern critic, uselessly
                    subjective), is another instance of that merging of the arts which we find in late nineteenth
                    century symbolist-decadence—a merging which may be present in <hi rend="i">Leaves of
                        Grass</hi> itself in unrecognized measure.</p>
            <p>Frenz has supplied notes to the letters, perhaps too full and numerous for the Whitman specialist,
                    who does not need to be told about Emerson's letter ("I greet you
                    …"), about the banning of the seventh edition in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, about the shirt sleeve picture in the first edition, about William Sloane Kennedy, and
                    so forth. Such notes would seem to be intended for those primarily interested in Irish literature
                    and affairs of the late nineteenth century. As one of a group instrumental in the revival of Irish
                    letters and culture at that time, as founder of the <hi rend="i">

            <p>F. Lauriston Bullard has achieved the highest degree of relevancy in his book <hi rend="i">

                    set forth by a display of enduring bronze statues bearing his likeness which have been dedicated to

                    </placeName> in stone supplement the exhaustive group of studies in metal.</p>
            <p>The work of Bullard becomes in a measure a "Who's Who" in American
                    sculpture. A brief biographical sketch is presented for each one of the fifty-six creators of the

                    </placeName> speakers who have assisted in the dedications, and excerpts from their addresses are
                    included. The newspaper training of the author has prepared him to select those human interest
                    incidents relating to the memorial projects to make the book something more than a mere tabulation.</p>
            <p>It is a strange coincidence indeed that Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, possibly the most sculptored American, and William Rush the first American-born
                    sculptor should be related. Both were descendants of Mordecai <placeName>

                    not many miles from the colonial community of the Lincolns where Bullard wrote his book.</p>
            <p>Writers have often speculated on what <placeName>

                    </placeName> might think if he were able to return and observe the reverence with which his memory
                    is held. This book invites one to wonder if possibly the statues made in his image would not
                    surprise him most. How amazed he would be to find himself at Westminster Abbey and in the Cathedral
                    of St. John the Divine; on university campuses and in city parks; at the intersections of great
                    highways and in the business sectors of major cities; in colossal profile on a great mountain side
                    and in a calm boyhood pose of Hoosier days. But above all, there would be his astonishment upon
                    viewing that seated figure in the Memorial at <placeName>

            <p>The purpose of this volume is to provide the student of ancient history with a handy collection of
                    important source materials to be used in connection with a general textbook of ancient history. The
                    selection of the specific items to be included in one single volume of this scope is far from
                    simple; no teachers of the subject would be in agreement. In this case passages from the ancient
                    writers have been very well selected; and the choice of non-literary materials is even more
                    satisfactory. In most instances the authors have used standard translations, but in some cases they
                    have made their own. It was an excellent plan to begin with a chapter consisting of passages in
                    which eight Greek and Roman historians explain their personal concepts of history and historians.
                    Later chapters contain representative selections both from these same historians, and from the
                    philosophers, dramatists, and poets. The passages chosen cover a wide range of interests: personal,
                    political, military, economic, and religious.</p>
            <p>The outstanding advantage of this book is the inclusion of many items which most teachers and
                    students would have considerable difficulty in locating. For example the interesting passages from
                    Pseudo-Xenophon, Arrian, Strabo, Josephus, the Augustan History, and Lactantius are frequently not
                    at hand in small libraries containing the better-known works of classical literature. This may also
                    be true of the lesser-known works of the famous authors themselves. Even more inaccessible would be
                    such valuable items as the following, reproduced here either in full, or in fairly extensive
                    excerpts: Four Tablets from Lagash; The Gilgamesh Epic; The Code of Hammurabi; The Behistan
                    Monument; Two Egyptian Hymns; Treaty with the Hittites; Law of the Twelve Tables; Letter of the
                    Consuls on the Bacchic Rites, complete; The Deeds of Augustus (<hi rend="i">Res Gestae</hi>),
                    complete; The Minutes of the Secular Games; Claudius' Letter to the Alexandrians,
                    complete; The Charter of Salpensa, complete extant portion.</p>
            <p>This book would be more useful if it contained more material of this type. Some space could have been
                    saved by eliminating entirely the selections from the famous literary works which are readily
                    available in standard translations and are often contained in comprehensive collections such as F.
                    R. B. <pb n="323" id="VAA4025-048-3-111"/> Godolphin (ed.), <hi rend="i">The Greek Historians</hi>
                    (Random House, 1942), and in numerous inexpensive editions. <hi rend="i">The Classical Weekly</hi>,
                    Vol. 45, pp. 116–19 (January 21, 1952), provided an up-to-date list of inexpensive books
                    for teaching the classics. The inclusion of short selections from the ancient historians,
                    biographers, dramatists, poets, and orators may well stimulate the reader's desire to
                    read the entire work; but if the teacher were to require the student to read at least one complete
                    book of Herodotus and Thucydides, some biographies of Plutarch, and selected Greek plays and
                    dialogues of Plato in full, this end would be served even better. It is probable, however, that the
                    present volume will actually reach a wider group than if the literary passages had been eliminated.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the usefulness of the book would have been enhanced if some of the following items had
                    been included: Selections from the Athenian Tribute Lists and other inscriptions dealing with
                    Athenian democracy and imperialism; some papyri of the Hellenistic period, in whole or in part, such
                    as the Revenue Laws of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and <hi rend="i">P. Teb</hi>. 703; a few samples of
                    inscriptions and papyri of the Roman period, instructive for provincial and local administration,
                    cults, <hi rend="i">et. al.;</hi> possibly some short literary works of special historical
                    importance in full, such as Aristotle and Pseud-Xenophon on the Constitution of the Athenians, of
                    which the authors already provide extensive portions.</p>
            <p>Unquestionably this is by far the best collection of readings of source material for ancient history
                    yet available in any single volume. The value of the items included far outweighs any shortcomings
                    due to omissions. If used as intended in connection with a good text, it will help the teacher
                    enrich his course by giving the student a keener insight into the character and importance of the
                    sources for ancient history. For teachers in small colleges or schools with inadequate library
                    facilities, and especially for those unacquainted with the languages involved, this book fills a
                    real need.</p>

            <p>Part One of this collection is a long narrative poem commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of
                    the death of Johnny Appleseed (real name was John Chapman). The stanzas are sestet in form; the
                    rhyme arrangement is a-b-a-b-c-c; and iambic tetrameter is the classification of the feet and meter.</p>
            <p>The reader follows the life of this frontiersman (1774–1845) from Leominster, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, the birthplace of Chapman, to the vicinity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, the place of his death. References are made to Johnny's early
                    education, his brief role as an itinerant missionary in some of the eastern states, and his sojourn
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. John and a friend bought a horse. The horse, Prince, during a moment of frolic
                    "let fly his heels." The result: "John lay dazed." While in his
                    stupor John had had a dream. He had talked with the angels and then walked with them past
                    "rows of blooming apple trees." Frolicsome Prince was sold, and the friends later
                    went their separate ways; yet the impact of the horse's heels, according to the poet,
                    must have had its influence upon Johnny because that "vision" had helped to
                    crystallize his purpose in life. Johnny Appleseed would "leave behind him more beauty and
                    peace than he had found. He would mitigate the hardships of those pioneers moving into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> by planting herb, flower, and fruit seeds —especially apple seeds. He drifts
                    down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River with his precious cargo of seeds, pioneering in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and adventuring in southern Indiana. The last phase of this pioneer
                    nurseryman's life centered around present-day <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, which is also the poet's home territory.</p>
            <p>Unlike many modern writers who stress character and personality, the poet, instead, has emphasized
                    the plot—a task which, even to approach exactness of detail, is in itself exceedingly
                    difficult because the documentary evidence is fragmentary; while on the other hand, there is an
                    abundance of legends and traditions. It would, therefore, be an injustice for this reviewer to even
                    attempt to review this poem in the light of historical accuracy.</p>
            <p>Those critics who belong to the historical-sociological school of literary criticism will probably
                    wish that the poet had placed more emphasis upon the age, environment, and society in which Johnny
                    Appleseed lived; whereas those critics who belong to the biographical-psychological school will
                    perhaps desire a greater reflection of personality and psychology in <pb n="325" id="VAA4025-048-3-113"/> this "story in verse." The present reviewer suggests,
                    since historical accuracy cannot be absolutely attained, that the poet might have been a little more
                    imaginative at times and that he might have used certain literary devices to enliven the story. A
                    sense of immediacy is possible through the idiom of the character, gradual accumulation of
                    impressions, or the stripped language technique. Various other devices might have been used to
                    present Johnny Appleseed—for example, having part of the story told in first person, the
                    use of dialogue, or the technique known as the stream of consciousness.</p>
            <p>Part Two of this collection presents ten shorter poems, with varied stanza forms and rhyme patterns.
                    The titles of these shorter poems run the gamut from "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>" to "Indiana." They are primarily patriotic and
                    nationalistic in theme; and many, in addition, have a deep religious undertone to them.</p>
            <p>There is some redundancy in these shorter poems (for example, p. 63 and p. 65); and although some of
                    the "eternal verities" are expressed in them, there seems to be nothing new or
                    refreshing as one starts with the first poem in this section of the book and reads through to the
                    last poem. Perhaps the general effect of these shorter poems would be better if the reader limited
                    himself to one or two poems for each reading period.</p>
            <p>There is some doubt in this reviewer's mind with respect to the poem entitled "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>." "Urged him [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>] at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName> to accept command" is the verse in question. Does this infer that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> was at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName> instead of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> when he received his appointment?</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly this work will not be of great interest to the professional historian. It should,
                    however, find its place upon the bookshelves of those who are interested in the legendary life of
                    Johnny Appleseed and who have a need for short patriotic poems. For example, the poem, "Our
                    Flag," seems to be very appropriate for a schoolboy to recite on Flag Day. An appendix
                    which contains a biography of John Chapman, historical notes, and bibliography is very useful to the
                    reader and adds to the value of the book. The poet has added to the ever-increasing literature of
                    the Midwest, and he has made a contribution to "Hoosieriana."</p>

            <p>The Coon or Fleener Cemetery of Jackson Township, Brown County, Indiana, is about four miles
                    southwest of Morgantown, Indiana, on the farm now owned by T. M. Butler. This plot was donated by
                    Jacob Fleener, one of the first settlers of Jackson Township, who came to the county as early as
                    1823 or 1824 from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. The plot is located about a quarter of a mile from the road on which Fleener built the
                    typical double log house. Since there was no church in the community at this early date, religious
                    services were held in his home, which were attended by the families in the neighborhood. Later a
                    family by the name of Coon purchased the farm and since that time the cemetery has been known as the
                    Coon Cemetery. One of Fleener's daughters married William Riley Ritter whose farm joined
                    the Fleener farm and the cemetery is sometimes called the Ritter Cemetery, but more frequently
                    referred to as the Coon or Fleener Cemetery. Inscriptions from the stones are as follows:</p>
