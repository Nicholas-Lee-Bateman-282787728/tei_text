                </p>
            <p>In the century after 1820, over thirty million people left Europe for America. Farmers, politicians,
                    clerics, craftsmen, women, children, and unskilled workers all made difficult journeys overland and
                    perilous ocean crossings. Although many came from remote European villages, immigrants were adept at
                    acquiring the information they needed for the move. Historians now realize that these travelers
                    seldom left Europe without knowing in advance a great deal about the conditions that they would
                    encounter in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Despite the primitive state of communications, these ordinary people were able to
                    convey important information to others to an extraordinary extent. Regardless of the ethnic group
                    involved, migrants relayed precise data about land costs, wage rates, and conditions that might be
                    encountered during weeks and months of travel. Crossing the ocean to a new land was an unpredictable
                    venture to be sure, but the travelers gathered all the information they could to help them make
                    their way.</p>
            <p>The information came in various forms. Family members and friends corresponded extensively. It was
                    not uncommon in a European village to receive mail from America describing which companies were
                    hiring or what skills would serve a potential migrant best. Some American states also sent booklets
                    and other forms of advertising to Europe in an attempt to attract newcomers, although some did this
                    more effectively than others. In the 1860s, for instance, Scottish emigrants knew much more about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> than they did about Indiana because legislators in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> were more willing to spend money on promotional literature than those in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Whatever format immigrant communications took, prospective newcomers looked carefully for clues that
                    would assist them in making <list type="footnotes">

                    for instance, needed to know something about the soil and the climate, as well as who might cheat
                    them along the immigrant trail from Europe. Thousands of Europeans crossed to America when they
                    received news of the Homestead Act (1862) and its promise of free land. And letters back home
                    instructed Mennonites coming to <placeName>

                    </placeName> on what type of wheat strains grew best in those areas.</p>
            <p>If immigrants thought about settlement in an industrial region, they were likely to look for
                    information about job openings, wage rates, and skills needed. Thus, Italians had already heard
                    about harsh conditions in steel mills before they arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and decided that they would rather take jobs outdoors doing construction work. British
                    metal workers knew the wage rates were higher in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> than in Birmingham. In a similar fashion, Irish immigrant families with many children
                    to feed sought out textile mills where the employment of adolescents was widespread and moved to
                    locations where teenagers could start earning a paycheck at an early age.</p>
            <p>In the article that follows, two German migrants to Indiana provide specific details that would help
                    those who followed them. Leaving the region of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> near the confluence of the Rhine and Ruhr rivers, a major center of German emigration
                    in the middle of the nineteenth century, they are able to offer valuable advice on the conditions of
                    travel and make important observations about American society in general. Consider how well Peter
                    Schultze describes what he finds on landing in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York City</region>
                    </placeName>. He not only identifies German restaurants and inns but notes some of the democratic
                    practices of American society itself. For potential travelers, Hermann Bullermann manages to
                    reconstruct quite specifically the journey from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to Indiana in 1849 and the rigors of travel on both land and water. The kinds of
                    documents created by these men were replicated time and again throughout the nineteenth century as
                    European immigrants worked in concert to exchange information and ease the burdens of moving to
                    America.</p>

            <p>On September 2, 1848, the sailing vessel <hi rend="i">Luconia</hi> departed from Antwerp with <placeName>

                    </placeName> as its destination. Of the twelve persons assigned to the steerage compartment, seven
                    were young Germans from the vicinity of Meurs, currently Moers, in the province of Nord
                    Rhein-Westphalia. Included among these men were Peter Schultze, a twenty-three-year-old merchant,
                    Hermann Bullermann, a farmer of thirty-one, and his younger brothers Balthasar and Wilhelm
                        George.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Located in a heavily populated region west of Duisburg near the
                    confluence of the Rhine and the Ruhr rivers, Meurs had become a part of Prussia in the eighteenth
                    century. Nearby was the city of Krefeld, which had been a temporary refuge in the seventeenth
                    century for the settlers of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Germantown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>. Hence, some of the very early
                    German settlers in North America had departed from this region.</p>
            <p>The lower Rhine was in a state of transition. Towns that formerly had been marketing centers and
                    seats of cottage industries were becoming more highly urbanized. Factories displaced small crafts;
                    mining increased in line with the demand for coal and coke; and surrounding agricultural land, of
                    necessity, was more intensively cultivated. A demographic study of Duisburg during this period
                    reveals some of the problems that might have confronted emigrants from the region. Furthermore, the
                    Prussian government under King Frederick William IV, although sensitive to some of the social
                    problems associated with industrialization, did not take seriously the aspirations of leaders of the
                    1848 revolution concerning a liberalized representative government.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What prompted these young men to emigrate? It could have been concern over the failing revolution of
                    1848 (which had affected most of the continent), population pressure, fear of conscription into the
                    Prussian army, adventurous spirits, or various combinations of these factors. Most of these men
                    settled down to a quiet life as farmers or merchants in southern Indiana, where relatives and
                    friends from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>

                                        on board. Everyone pays one Franc for our transfer. It is 7:30 and beginning to
                                        get dark. We arrive at the Luconia, and we are cheated by 1/2 Franc per person.
                                        Anyone who did not pay could not leave the small boat. So what should we do? It
                                        was impossible to go back with our luggage, and where should we complain? So we
                                        paid. We climb up a ladder and are on board. In <placeName>

                                        cabin. It looked desolate. We formed a long line and the first lit a lantern. We
                                        all moved forward and now we could see our rooms clearly illuminated by the
                                        light. Excluding the beds, we had a room 12 feet long, twelve feet
                                        wide…. Everything was in a mess and the first thing that happened was
                                        to nominate somebody to be in charge of food to decide what was to be eaten. I
                                        was elected to do that and a pantry was set up in the lowest bunkbed and an
                                        inventory of available food was made. After two hours I finished working in the
                                        pantry and the beds were assigned. In the beginning we did not like the upper
                                        bunks but we later changed our minds. Everyone had to choose his two bunk mates.</hi>

                    comment on it until October 6, when, following a severe storm, strong winds drove the ship towards
                    the North American continent at what must have been near top speed—ten miles per hour. On
                    October 8, the ship encountered a frigid storm, and they caught an American nightingale. There was a
                    near fatality October 14, when a heavy pulley struck a sailor on the head. Later that day they
                    caught eight land birds. The following incident amused Peter:<text>

                                        look for an inn. Without directions we walked through the city for about an hour
                                        until we found an inn, the Ivening (<hi rend="i">sic</hi>) Star, a German

                                        so we reserved space for six people. Then we went back to the ship with a basket
                                        of food to satisfy the hungry people who had stayed there. Next we had our

                                        dollar…. We could not get our boxes until 9 o'clock the next morning.

                                        it is so natural and unpretentious. A warm bath and a dust removal facility were
                                        in a small room. Right next to it were big halls for shaving and haircuts. Here

                                        how many thousands of people are there. One would find every kind of baked
                                        goods, vegetables, fowl, venison, fish, fruit, preserves, live rabbits, live

                                        in an inn would be considered uncouth. He lounges nonchalantly in a comfortable
                                        mahogany chair in the style of German garden chairs. He would have his feet on
                                        the window bench or wherever he likes. He might even break some chairs if he is
                                        in a good mood, and he is probably not spending a cent in the place. Drinking

                                        outside, and we have not had a chance to see them all. On Tuesday we went up to
                                        Linton, where Bethel is situated. Here we stayed with farmer Weins in a place
                                        called New Jerusalem</hi> [now Linton], <hi rend="i">about which Pastor
                                        Tölke had written us. This farm is 240 acres big, well-equipped, with
                                        a nice fruit orchard. Eighty acres are cultivated and they are situated very
                                        nicely. Rubens will most likely buy it. I have seen two more farms here which
                                        are next to each other. They were both for sale and I liked them very much. The
                                        ground is gently sloping towards a prairie, and on the prairie there are still
                                        eighty acres of mature forest. One farm is 215 acres with a house, eighty
                                        fenced-in acres, not all of which are cultivated. The price is one thousand
                                        dollars. Another farm is 110 acres, nicely equipped, with house and orchard,
                                        much of it under cultivation. I don't know how much it costs because the owner
                                        has been away, but it should be more expensive, according to the conditions. By
                                        the way, there are many farms for sale because all the Americans want to sell.
                                        In the vicinity there is also Congressional land still available for sale. We

                                    <hi rend="i">people here are quite healthy. Rubens, Schultze, Balthasar and I are
                                        all feeling quite well and during the entire trip we were not sick at all. Also
                                        Bolten and Berns and their families are quite well and happy and say hello to
                                        their family through you. In Bethel you can still find stags and wild turkeys in
                                        flocks of twenty to thirty, just as big as our turkeys at home, twenty to thirty
                                        pounds. I myself saw a flock of them. They were only ten feet away. They have to
                                        be shot with bullets because birdshot kills them only if you shoot them in the
                                        head. Recently I saw three stags in one afternoon. They are shot from perches.
                                        There are also prairie hens in flocks of twenty to thirty. Partridges and
                                        rabbits are plentiful here, but they are smaller than at home. There are also
                                        plenty of wild ducks and geese. The area here is very beautiful and due to the
                                        many prairies it is especially suited for cattle breeding. Last night Berns and
                                        Bolten arrived here again. Steller arrived after them. Everybody liked it very
                                        much here in Bethel, and they will stay with us the first few days. Bolten has
                                        chosen some Congress land and Berns will buy a farm. Bolten would very much like
                                        his family to come here in the spring. We will go to <placeName>

            <p>This is the story of how <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, became the first town in the world to be generally lighted by electricity.
                    When first proposed, the lights seemed expensive and exotic to many town residents, some of whom
                    staunchly opposed them. The Age of Electricity was not yet born, light was still produced by fire,
                    and work was largely done by muscle power. This story examines the context in which electric
                    lighting emerged, the key role Americans (and midwesterners) played in the process, and the brief
                    claim to fame by <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s discovery earned him international fame long before his career as a foreign diplomat.
                    Although Europeans such as Michael Faraday formulated many of the earliest electrical theories,
                    Americans excelled at putting electricity to work. By Thomas Edison's time, Americans had already
                    produced a series of groundbreaking inventions: Eli Whitney's cotton gin (1792)' Robert <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fulton</region>
                    </placeName>'s steamboat (1806)' Samuel Colt's revolver (1835), Samuel Morse's telegraph (1844)' and
                    Christopher Sholes's typewriter (1867), for example. French author Alexis de Tocqueville noted the
                    American flair for invention as early as the 1830s. But in the sphere of electricity, Americans
                    carved a special niche that remains at the core of their identity. With the likes of Alexander

                            carbon rods approximately one-half inch thick and twelve inches in length, placed vertically
                            one on top of the other and separated by a slight gap. Soon after Alessandro Volta invented
                            a battery in 1800, scientists discovered that a spark would leap across two wires connected
                            to a battery's terminals, but it took approximately eighty years for inventors to develop
                            the right kind of voltage generators, carbon rods, and a means of regulating the gap as the
                            rods burned in order to produce a commercially practical light. The incandescent bulb
                            invented by Edison in 1879 was, however, a vacuum-chamber glass bulb much like today's
                            lights, which contained a small high-resistance paper carbon filament, and burned much
                            cooler and dimmer than the arc light. Today's incandescent bulb features a tungsten
                            filament, invented around 1910. See "Creating the Electric Age," <hi rend="i">Electric Power Research Institute Journal</hi>, 4 (March 1979), 19, 25.</item>

                    flagstaff were turned on. An eyewitness described the peculiar crowd reaction:</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>Suddenly from the towering dome of the courthouse burst a flood of light, which under ordinary
                        circumstances would have caused a shout of <hi rend="i">rejoicing</hi> from the thousands who
                        had been crowding and jostling each other in the evening's darkness. No shout or token of joy,
                        however, disturbed the deep silence that suddenly settled on the vast crowd that had gathered
                        from far and near to witness the consummation of a singular enterprise. The people, almost with
                        bated breath, stood overwhelmed with awe as if they were near a supernatural presence. The
                        strange, weird light, exceeded in power only by the sun, yet mild as moonlight, rendered the
                        courthouse square as light as mid-day.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    experiment, was in his barnyard when the lights went on. "Down on your knees,
                    Mary!" he exclaimed, running into the house with bulging eyes, "The end of the
                    world's here!" Another eyewitness, Dr. James Biggerstaff of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, recalled, "I was just a boy, but it was one of the greatest thrills of my

                    the light was far-reaching." The town was packed with visitors, many of them highly
                    skeptical, he recalled. "And such a hurrahing and shouting as went up from those thousands
                    of persons when the light flashed on, after a minute of stunned silent surprise—you never

                    <hi rend="i">Plain Dealer</hi> played a pivotal role in procuring the lights and also in putting
                    down opposition to the lights. The paper's chief editors, T. P. Keator and Thad <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had first come up with the idea for the lights. Keator was strolling one night through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, with its elegant one-year-old courthouse perched high on a hillside overlooking the
                    town, when he remarked to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> that, "If you had a barrel of tar on the dome of the court house and set it on
                    fire it would light up the whole city."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> The idea of electric lights
                    followed naturally as inventor Charles Brush had made headlines the previous year when he tested his
                    electric lights in a public square in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> to meet Brush, who was eager for an opportunity to test the latest improvements to his
                    lights. At the time, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>'s gas street lights, although not extensive, were a considerable drain on the town
                    budget. The prospect of a far cheaper system was probably a key factor in the town council's
                    decision to authorize Keator and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> to strike a deal with Brush whereby the town would pay Brush one hundred dollars to
                    install the lights for a trial period.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The terms also specified that the lights
                    should illuminate a half-mile radius with the brilliance of a standard-size gas burner at all
                    points, thus lighting most of the town. This was a distinction upon which <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                    "generally" lighted by electricity. If fully satisfied, the <placeName>

                    </placeName> had already been abandoned for ten years. No doubt the canal failure, still fresh in

                    </placeName> and helped to augment the widespread skepticism toward any government-financed public
                    project. To many the lights seemed a visionary scheme and Keator's enthusiasm seemed absolutely
                    foolish. Butler said, "I doubt whether Lutz and Hubbard would have antagonized [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] the appropriation so tenaciously had not Keator grown over-enthusiastic and
                    in public print declared that one probable result would be that the effect of the electric lights

                    about one evening when Linn and Keator met while walking on the street. According to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, words were exchanged, and Linn put his revolver to Keator's throat; but the city
                    marshal and others intervened. Linn was fined for carrying a concealed weapon. "For several
                    months," <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> wrote, "We all carried guns, but there was no further outbreak."
                    Dozens of strongly worded letters published by the papers remain the best record of public
                    sentiment. The letters conveyed shock and outrage because by 1880 no other city in the U.S. had ever
                    purchased an electric street lighting system.</p>
            <p>Keator's enthusiastic claims also served as a point of contention. His original assertion that the
                    lights would illuminate fine print eight miles from the courthouse drew letters of ridicule and
                    criticism. When Keator amended his statement by claiming the light would "not light up the
                    country more than a mile distant," he was ridiculed again for changing his position.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Some letters suspected a conflict of interest. One long and detailed letter
                    in particular alleged a conspiracy to defraud the taxpayers of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. "Mr. James McCrea, a member of the City Council," it began,
                    "is exhibiting entirely too much zeal in his efforts to saddle the electric light fraud

            <p>Agricultural issues were of course a key consideration, although they were something of a red
                    herring. "The <hi rend="i">Plain Dealer says</hi> the electric light will virtually turn
                    night into day, and as chickens never sleep during daylight it is only a matter of time when every

                    farmers in particular should help pay for the lights since they would allow farmers to plow night
                    and day. Others predicted that corn in the vicinity might double in size, requiring saws to harvest
                    it, or that nighttime raccoon hunting in the area might enjoy such a boost that the price of coon
                    dogs would be driven beyond reach. The notion that crops would become vastly more productive under
                    electric lighting was apparently not without support among scientists. The <hi rend="i">Plain

            <p>The first arc light, invented by British scientist Sir Humphrey Davy in 1808, occupied an entire room
                    containing two thousand voltaic cells. Davy discovered that electricity could be made to leap from
                    one carbon rod to another, thus producing a brilliant light.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> As a young boy

                    </placeName>, Charles Brush read scientific literature voraciously and experimented on his own with
                    electromagnets, induction coils, motors, and other electrical devices. The textbook description of
                    an arc light, however, held a particular fascination for him, and when he finally got enough
                    batteries together to make one it filled him with "joy unspeakable."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>Early arc lights had a number of severe limitations. Besides being expensive and hard to power, a
                    proper gap had to be maintained between the carbon rods, which shrank as they burned. Also, the
                    lights' extreme brilliance was only suitable for outdoor use or large indoor spaces. Nevertheless,
                    arc lights found use in specialty applications such as a <placeName>

                    expensive for general use. Inspired by the Gramme dynamo, Brush began developing a
                    "distinctly new" dynamo and arc light, which he unveiled at the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. One problem with the lights, however, was the need for someone to install fresh
                    carbons at intervals throughout the night. His improved design, which was tested in <placeName>

                    </placeName> for the first time, solved this problem as well as others. Brush was able to sell six
                    thousand units of the improved lights in 1880, the first year of explosive growth both for his
                    company and the electric lighting industry in general.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    Powered by steam, Edison's generator distributed dc current as far as five thousand feet to a total

                    following fifteen years, people went from seeing electricity as a strange and fearful oddity to
                    something that could save them labor, provide them with new comforts, and entertain them in new
                    ways. By almost sheer luck, <placeName>

                    around the world that they had a need for electric power. Since March 31, 1880, the use of
                    electricity has spread rapidly across the earth.</p>

                    </placeName> over street lighting was perhaps also a harbinger of the much larger struggle to come
                    over electrical distribution systems. In the fifteen years following 1880, inventors, corporations,
                    and financial moguls scrambled to establish the dominant form of electrical power. Dubbed
                    "the battle of the currents" by the press, this struggle was driven by two chief
                    groups: Thomas Edison and his faction in favor of direct current (dc) power distribution and the
                    much smaller faction lead by George Westinghouse, who advocated alternating current (ac) power.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Edison was a man who could invent stock tickers, phonographs, and light bulbs, he had very
                    little formal schooling and worked mostly by trial and error. Hence he completely failed to see the
                    value of alternating current, which depended heavily on theories so nebulous that only a handful of
                    people could comprehend them at the outset. Nikola Tesla, the man who discovered the key concepts of
                    rotating magnetic fields that made ac motors, generators, and transmitters possible, eventually
                    found work as an assistant at Edison's laboratory, but his ideas were not well received there. He
                    left to work for Westinghouse, an inventor who himself had been trying to harness ac current. With
                    Westinghouse's help, Tesla brought his ideas to fruition and in 1888 registered the patents that
                    became the cornerstone of the modern industrial world.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

                    clear that dc power could not be efficiently distributed over distances. A major showdown occurred

            <p>Western civilization has always depended on two crucial elements: water and bread. It is well known
                    that these are biological necessities, and yet few people really consider their impact on the
                    settlement of the New World or the part they have played in the development of modern culture. Most
                    people in this society can go to the store and buy breads, pies, rolls, and all the other
                    flour-based products they will ever need without dealing with flour in raw form. In the generation
                    that is currently coming of age it will be possible for people to go their entire lives and never
                    purchase a five-pound bag of flour or know what to do with it if they did. However, in the recent
                    past, subsistence activities required not only the acquisition of flour, but in many cases the
                    processing of grain to flour or meal as a necessary part of family life. In the early part of this
                    century, and most certainly in the nineteenth century, almost every person had some role in the
                    processing of grist. Grains such as corn and wheat can be converted to usable form only by the
                    application of some form of energy. The preferred and most efficient source of that power in early
                    America was water. From the first millennium B.C. to the early twentieth century, grist mills,
                    particularly water-driven ones, were the centers around which human society organized; consequently
                    it follows that settlement patterns of the eighteenth and nineteenth century in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    local use and, because of the limited transportation system of the time, did little or no commercial
                    milling other than that which could be locally consumed. Sophisticated storage was limited and grain
                    stored better than corn meal or flour, <list type="footnotes">

               </figure> so milling was often done monthly or quarterly at the longest interval. Some mills were
                    divided in time between two or more different products. Many were owned and operated by local
                    farmers and were shut down several days a week or completely during peak farming times. Others that
                    were lucky enough to be located along the path of a railroad or in the county seats became known as
                    "merchant mills." Many of these mills were prosperous enough to incorporate
                    changes that made the mass production of flour possible.</p>
            <p>Most resources on the subject of milling indicate two major "revolutions" in the
                    processes of American milling. The first was created by Oliver Evans in the construction of a mill
                    near Wilmington, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1785.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> This mill built by Evans and his brother incorporated
                    automation in order to replace those carrying operations that had before been done by manual labor.
                    Initially, American millers saw the mill as "a set of rattle traps."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> By 1808, however, Evans found it necessary to appeal to Congress for aid and relief in
                    patent infringement from other millers, including Thomas Jefferson. Evans's designs were complex and
                    required capitalization beyond the means of most part-time millers, but those operations that were
                    involved in the merchant trade or the flour export business could not afford to ignore the
                    labor-saving features of the Evans patents. The incorporation of <list type="footnotes">

                    capable of production for regional distribution as transportation improved.</p>
            <p>The second revolution of the industry involved transportation itself. Originally, small grist mills
                    thrived because of a lack of transportation networks. Beginning in the 1850s railroads and improved
                    transportation began to create regional markets and larger business enterprises. By the 1870s
                    railroads had grown from a scant 10,000 miles of track in pre-Civil War days to over 60,000 miles,
                    with a continuing increase of more than 100,000 miles more by the 1880s.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Steam
                    engines of the era required water just as the mills did, so it was natural that the railroads and
                    mills, especially the ones in population centers, should meet. During the 1870s steam power was also
                    on the increase in mills. Those mills that were considered commercial and could afford the
                    capitalization added steam initially as a form of back up power and later as primary power.</p>

                    </placeName>—the White and the Mississinewa rivers—the remains of at least
                    fourteen of possibly twenty mills can be found. Some are easily visible, with features like manmade
                    raceways and foundations still protruding through the river sediment. Others have been graded into
                    near oblivion by housing or industrial development, but even these sites can be identified with some
                    knowledge of historical sources and settlement-era technology. As far as is known, all of these
                    mills were of the vertical type. Vertical mills used two large round stones with two flat surfaces,
                    one on top of the other, driven by water power from a wheel to mill various types of grains.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> In most cases, different sets of stones were used for different grains, and in
                    most of the literature of the time each set of stones was referred to as a "run of
                        stone."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Some of the smaller mills might have run corn one day and
                    wheat another with the same set of stones, but this practice was viewed generally as a poor way to
                    process grain because the stones were worked to accommodate a particular grain size. Helm's <hi rend="i">History of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware County</region>

               </hi> mentions the types of stones used many times; however, the only specific
                    mention of the millstone sources is one set of pink granite stone that was quarried in the
                    "East" and shipped to the county and another reference to stones that were shaped
                    from native river stone.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> For example, a run of stone might be described as

                    </placeName>. Several of these evolved into the merchant mills of the second half of the century,
                    but the real importance of these mills is their relationship to the first settlers. Oliver Johnson,
                    an early settler, sums it up best:</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>The little log mills spotted around the county was mighty essential to the settlers. They ground
                        our corn into meal and I don't reckon we could get by without cornbread…. The mills
                        used stone burrs and ground mighty slow. It took about an hour to grind a bushel or two of corn,
                        and at that it wasn't much more than finely cracked. There was no money charged for grindin; the
                        miller tolled your grist by takin out one eighth of the corn as his pay. Sometimes the miller
                        was several days behind with his grindin, and the rule was first come first served. If a family
                        was out of meal an stood in purty well with the miller, he might take pity on you and slip your
                        grist in ahead of the others. Or you could leave your grist and take another home with you.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>The 1810 census statement of "Arts and Manufactures" lists flour production in
                    Indiana as an "Article of Doubtful Nature or Agricultural," but no accurate
                    breakdown by county is available until after 1850. In the 1810 census Indiana is listed as having
                    milling production of 1,500 bushels in its one wheat mill, with a market value of $7,500,
                    and thirty-two "grist" mills with 40,900 bushels equal to about $44,708
                    in value (figure 11).<hi rend="sup">12</hi> By 1850 milling production in the state had reached
                    $5,564,091 (figure 21, and the same manufacturing index records show a value of at least
                    $46,900 from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware County</region>

                    capabilities, however, because the census seems to list only those establishments that were classed
                    as "merchant mills" and their gross cash revenues. This approach apparently
                    excludes the value of barter and the revenues of some of the smaller agricultural establishments.
                    The 1850 census indicates that there were only seven mills surveyed in the county; there were,
                    however, fourteen known mills in 1840 and probably more before 1850, since that seems to be one of
                    the times of the largest growth in the milling business in the county. This problem may reflect
                    either the way the census was taken or the reporting system of the time.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> By

                    twenty-two people and accounted for $331,232 of product (figure 3). Once again, this
                    figure may be deceptively low because only about one-half of the actual grist mills were counted.
                    The others may have been part time, agricultural, or noncommercial in nature.</p>
            <p>An indicator of the multiple use of grist mills or milling facilities may be found in the census

                    </placeName> and was also used for wool carding and liquor. If other mills were this diversified,
                    then figures such as $34,460 in lumber, $2,800 in wool carding,
                    $6,915 in woolen goods, and $8,000 in malt liquor may be a more honest

                    Multiple product utilization of milling facilities is not accurately reflected in the early census
                    returns. Corn, classified as Indian corn and yellow corn, shows as an agricultural product as early
                    as 1820. Nevertheless, corn is not specifically listed until the 1850 census.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                    Up to that time, mill production is listed as grist or flour only, so other products being processed
                    are not specified.</p>
            <p>The census of 1870 is a much more sophisticated survey of American business and milling products, but
                    it shows primarily commercial figures and may be unreliable for judging actual mill activity within
                    a specific area. This census has a table of the various grist mill products manufactured in 1870,
                    listed by county (figure 4). The overall statistics presented in this figure reveal the growth of
                    the industry in the state. One problem is that economic indicators such as inflation are not
                    accounted for and probably cannot be in the absence of consistent data. Some figures, although
                    sketchy, would indicate that between the years 1820 and 1880 a bushel of wheat increased in dollar
                    value as much as four times. This would make monetary figures highly unreliable as indicators of
                    industrial growth. The 1870 census shows <placeName>

                    in the state during the same time. Millers may have shifted toward associated products that were not
                    counted as milling industry production. These products mentioned earlier had climbed considerably in
                    value and were now worth $95,360—a $51,185 increase over the
                    previous census. The $328,000 valuation may indicate either a decline in the production
                    of flour or a diversification of mill resources or both. Finally, the heading of "Flouring
                    and Mill Products" may give no real indicator of anything other than commercial flour

                    $219,472. The census records for the county no longer mentioned malt liquor and

                    deal fell through at the end of three years. Frazell traded the unexpired portion of the lease to
                    Henry Wysor. Wysor operated the mill until about 1845 when he, James Russey, and John Jack purchased
                    the mill and began operations under the name of Russey, Jack and Co. In 1850 Russey died, and the
                    firm continued to operate as Wysor &amp; Jack. During the autumn of 1854 they constructed a new
                    mill on the west side of Walnut Street at the present location of the Star Bank, on the corner of
                    what is now Wysor and Walnut 121. The mill was completed with four sets of stones and operated until
                    1856, when a new mill was erected. The new mill included five discharge wheels with a combined
                    seventy-five horsepower. It was fifty by sixty feet, five stories high, with four floors, including
                    the basement. Steam power was added in 1858. Jack died in 1859, and the business was continued as
                    Kline &amp; Wysor. In 1868 they removed two wheels and installed two <placeName>

                    was one barrel of flour for a month's work. Hastings completed the sawmill but died before the flour
                    mill was finished. The mill site passed through the hands of Joseph Goodlove and John Shafer before
                    it was purchased by Benjamin Zehner in 1864. Zehner improved the mill with a three-story frame
                    building, a basement with three sets of burrs, and two turbine wheels—a

                    until late in the nineteenth century. An 1860 census recorder wrote in his notes that the

                    location of several mills, although some were in the same location with different ownership. The
                    first mentioned is that of William Hardwick, who in 1832 "added a burr for grinding corn
                    near the Yingling Woolen Mill"<hi rend="bold">[11]</hi>.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

            <p>A mill operated by the "Honorable Oliver H. Smith through 1838 and 1839 is also mentioned.
                    Thereafter several other mills are noted, but little detail is available about their operation.
                    Mills were owned by Jesse Williamson, the Bee Line Railroad, and a Jones. One is said to have been
                    destroyed by a gas explosion in 1880 and later rebuilt, but its ownership is unclear. The mill,
                    which did custom milling, was said to have three stories and a basement with two Lef-fell wheels.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> A survey of the area indicates that Buck Creek now follows what was the mill

                    was later sold to Charles Carter and a Mr. Johnson, and in 1847 it was the Carter Brother's Mill. A
                    frame merchant mill was built, which burned about 1850. The Carter brothers rebuilt a mill on the
                    same site, and in 1860 Charles Carter dug a new race. Shortly after the close of the Civil War, the
                    Carter brothers erected a mill in Eaton. It was a frame building, forty-five by fifty, four stories
                    high with two sets of stones and a capacity of ten bushels an hour; the race had a fall often feet

            <p>The other mill of prominence in Union Township was founded by David Studebaker in 1845 [<hi rend="bold">14</hi>]. Initially it was a saw and linseed oil mill. The mill was sold in 1852 to
                    William Mitchell, who added a carding mill. In 1863 it was sold to Michael Hyland, who made
                    improvements by adding a two-story, forty-five by twenty seven flouring mill.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>The remains of the Studebaker Mill are significant because it may have run until well into the

                    the operating mechanism, if still present, remains buried under sediment.</p>

            <p>This listing of mills is by no means complete. Many small mills existed as home businesses and others
                    existed without mention as a business. The sources were often confused about the names of people who
                    owned them. Although some were known by one name, such as Carter's or Black's, others, such as the
                    mills at Yorktown, changed names many times, and each source may call it something different.</p>

                    <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-095-4-060"/> small rural communities grew up around grist mills with
                    adequate capacity to support populations. The combination of restricted transportation and power
                    sources led to a proliferation of smaller mills. This pattern changed as rail access developed. The
                    mills that survived diversified and produced other products. As flour became commercially available
                    on a broader basis, more individuals could purchase it without ever being directly involved in the
                    production or processing of wheat. Access to other energy forms in the early twentieth century
                    caused the water mills to become obsolete rapidly and disappear.</p>
            <p>In a larger sense grist mills may be used to understand change that is still taking place. Mills
                    represent locally owned businesses that are involved in competition with regional and national
                    distribution systems. As transportation changed after 1850 the growth and survival of those mills
                    that had access to rail can be seen. These mills assumed a broader commercial orientation and
                    adopted dominant forms of power and production. The speed with which growth and obsolescence takes
                    place is related to the increase of the scope of the country's transportation system. From the
                    vantage point in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware county</region>
                    </placeName> one might conclude that roads and rails signaled the beginning of the end of rural life
                    in America. These trends continue today as larger regional and national businesses encroach upon
                    local markets, which in turn cause the closure of locally owned businesses. Transportation has made
                    mass production possible but often at local cost.</p>
            <p>The history of milling also shows us something about the speed with which change took place. Milling
                    was almost a static technology from the early Greeks to 1850. From 1850 to the present we have seen
                    increasingly rapid change. It might be interesting to note that although this change can be viewed
                    as a product of the times, in another sense changes in milling technology and location may have been
                    the principal facilitator of modern civilization. Western civilization depends on flour and
                    associated products as a food staple. Therefore, expansion and growth of twentieth century
                    population centers may well have been fueled by the availability of flour from a distance.</p>

                    prosecution of the war. Squier's final letters, written in the summer of 1865, offer an interesting

                    walked over the latter battlefield, Squier described the suffering of wounded men begging for
                    blankets to keep from freezing to death, including thirty "poor wretches" who had
                    dragged themselves to a fire and lay "as close as they could be packed (p. 43). He noted
                    that the pockets of dead Confederates had been searched for valuables, a practice Squier himself
                    participated in as he "liberated an ink stand and a pair of gloves from an enemy corpse.</p>
            <p>The only disappointment in <hi rend="i">This Wilderness of War</hi> is a minor one. Although Squier
                    participated in some of the most important campaigns in the war's western theater, he missed the
                    fight at Fort Donelson due to illness, and his regiment was not actively involved in any major
                    campaigns after the Battle of Chickamauga. In late 1863, the 44th was relegated to garrison duty in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and languished there for the remainder of the war. One can only imagine the fine
                    letters Squier might have penned if the 44th had taken an <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-095-4-062"/>

                    </placeName> campaigns or Sherman's "March to the Sea." Despite this longing for
                    more, we should be grateful that Squier saw as much of the war as he did, and that his letters
                    survived.</p>

            <p>Town and community studies continue to make important contributions to understanding the settlement
                    of the Midwest. Worthington, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, settled in 1803 predominantly by Episcopalian families from Granby, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, makes an ideal case study in this genre. The Granby settlers were organized as the
                    Scioto Company in 1802 under the leadership of James Kilbourn, an ambitious would-be entrepreneur
                    and Episcopal lay preacher. After the company bought 16,000 acres of land along the Olentangy River
                    in central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, all forty shareholders and their families moved to Worthington by 1803.</p>
            <p>Virginia E. McCormick and Robert W. McCormick have written a lively, detailed, and appropriately
                    documented account of Worthington from these <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> origins to the mid-1830s. At its best, this local history makes a valuable contribution
                    to the panorama of early <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and midwestern history. Nevertheless, its celebratory framework limits the
                    possibilities of exploring some significant historical issues in greater depth. The McCormicks
                    sought to explain why an apparently "old New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> village" now lies surrounded by the suburbs of greater <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but they did not question the common lore about the town. They accept at face value,
                    for example, the assumption that the superficial New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> appearance of present-day Worthington (named in honor of a prominent <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> land speculator, by the way) is evidence that the original proprietors intended to
                    transplant New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> culture to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> frontier. That misleading premise colors the whole work.</p>
            <p>The main problem is that Kilbourn and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> Scioto Company investors were not stereotypical Yankees. They were Episcopalians and
                    thus outsiders in a state dominated by a Congregational standing order. It is doubtful that the
                    Worthington settlers <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-095-4-063"/> wished to recreate the very New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> culture that had limited their social, political, and economic ambitions. Rather, they
                    escaped to the West seeking fresh opportunities free from entrenched Yankee cultural values and
                    economic constraints. They may have wanted to establish an exclusively Episcopalian town, but even
                    this modest ambition was undermined by the realities of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> settlement.</p>
            <p>The Worthington pioneers behaved no differently than other <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> settlers. During their first three decades, they established farms, stores and other
                    economic institutions, a school, and several additional voluntary societies, including an Episcopal
                    congregation. Ironically, they quickly became a minority in their own town, as the Episcopalian
                    founders could neither prevent outsiders from buying land in the vicinity nor keep landless men from
                    residing in Worthington itself. In this supposedly "typical New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> town," Presbyterians and Methodists built permanent houses of worship before
                    the Episcopalian founders. In short, the McCormicks show nicely that Worthington was not so
                    different from most other <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> towns, where competing groups created diverse, interesting, and dynamic communities.</p>
            <p>Worthington remained a village of fewer than 600 residents well into the twentieth century,
                    perpetually overshadowed by nearby <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After World War II, Worthington mushroomed to 15,000 as the metropolitan suburbs grew
                    outward to meet and eventually surround the town. The nineteenth-century quaintness of the village
                    center may have more to do with its century of stagnation than to a lasting New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> influence, even the influence of Yankee dissenters. Indeed, it is not clear that
                    Worthington was ever, or ever intended to be, "the New <placeName>

            <p>Major-General Henry Procter, who commanded British forces on the <geogName>Detroit River</geogName>
                    during the War of 1812, has been much criticized. After an American army under William Henry
                    Harrison defeated him at Moraviantown (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="onc">Ontario</region>
                    </placeName>) in 1813, a court martial reprimanded <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-095-4-064"/> Procter for
                    incompetence. Historians have generally endorsed that opinion, but in Sandy Antal the general has
                    found a strenuous defender.</p>
            <p>This is more than a study of Procter. It is the first comprehensive survey of the war on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the British perspective, and it brims with perceptive and long overdue insights.
                    Historians have seldom portrayed the difficulties the British encountered working with American
                    Indian allies so effectively. Moreover Antal is excellent on the logistics, the varying strategies
                    and war aims, and the difficulties unsympathetic superiors imposed upon Procter. He rightly emerges
                    as a sound strategist, who strove to maintain a military offensive in extremely difficult
                    circumstances, and as a generally humane man, greatly concerned, for example, by the predicament of
                    his Indian supporters.</p>
            <p>However, Antal's Procter is a rather one-dimensional figure. In reality he was more complex, a
                    compound of strengths and weaknesses. It is the author's refusal to come to grips with the latter,
                    and to explore their influence upon events, that constitutes the flaw in his book. Antal does not
                    fully address the formidable indictment against Procter: he repeatedly failed to protect prisoners
                    from the Indians; his relations with his regiment grew poor, partly because he unloaded the blame
                    for the military disasters of 1813 onto officers and men in his public dispatches; and he was an
                    indifferent communicator. Both senior officers and Indian allies such as Tecumseh had difficulty
                    tracking his changing intentions. Since effective command involves fostering teamwork and morale,
                    Procter's army had socially disintegrated even before its final defeat.</p>
            <p>In Antal's eagerness to exculpate Procter, the author occasionally misleads. In September and October
                    1813 Procter damaged the confidence of the Indians, first by dismantling Fort Amherstburg without
                    consultations, and second by dishonoring a pledge to fortify the forks of the River Thames (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="onc">Ontario</region>
                    </placeName>). Antal clouds this picture by uncritically reproducing Procter's version of events,
                    omitting other evidence, and dispensing blame to others, including Tecumseh and the British Indian
                    agent Matthew Elliott, who were wrestling with the consequences of the general's actions. Similarly,
                    Antal's attempt (partly founded on Procter's dispatch of October 23,1813) to minimize the general's
                    absences from the main body of his troops on the last retreat considerably understates a problem
                    well attested elsewhere. Procter's associates are frequently treated less than justly. There is no
                    recognition of Elliott's efforts to recruit the Indians who won the "British"
                    victories in the West, and several of the author's attempts to diminish Tecumseh, including the
                    statement that he abandoned the British alliance in the late summer of 1812, are either erroneous or
                    unfair.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, this is a good book, which with a more balanced view of Procter could easily have been
                    a great one. It is well written, expertly crafted, and competently researched. Antal's willingness
                    to <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-095-4-065"/> confront the dogmas of conventional history is admirable.
                    The volume is essential reading for students of the War of 1812, Harrison, Tecum-seh, and
                    British-Indian operations in the Old Northwest.</p>

                    </placeName> with Major General Godfrey Weitzel's Twenty-fifth Corps. There, in the summer and fall
                    of 1865 with the 28th USCT, the 29th formed part of Third Brigade, Second Division under Brigadier
                    General Charles S. Russell, who had been the first colonel of the 28th. The final chapter gives
                    interesting details about the postwar careers of a number of soldiers. Indeed, an important feature
                    of this book is the information of potential genealogical value that Miller provides through his
                    research in the military and pension records of individual officers and men. One misses, however, in
                    the pages dealing with recruitment, any reference to the support that black churches, particularly
                    the African Methodist Episcopal Church, gave to the war effort.</p>
            <p>The numerous illustrations include photographs of Colonel Bross, General Weitzel, and some of the
                    privates of the 29th. The <pb n="388" id="VAA4025-095-4-066"/> few noteworthy lapses include the
                    misspelling of Thomas Wentworth Higginson's name and L'Ouverture Hospital as
                    "L'Ouerture." Miller confuses Major General David B. Birney with his brother
                    Brigadier General William Birney. A map of the battlefield at Petersburg described in the cutline as
                    "drawn by a participant, showing Ledlie's division and lines at the crater" and
                    bearing an original title, "Position of the 1st Brig. 1st Div. 9th Corps. Before Petersburg
                    Va.," in fact shows the deployment of the First Brigade, First Division in early 1865, long
                    after Ledlie had been cashiered for misconduct at the Battle of the Crater (p. 144).</p>
            <p>Without exaggerating their contribution on the field of battle, Miller has written an informed and
                    respectful tribute to the men of the 29th USCT, concluding that "they did their duty. This
                    is the best compliment one can pay to a soldier" (p. xi).</p>

            <p>Memoirs of the Civil War are a well-known genre. Their value inevitably depends on the significance
                    of the writers' experiences, the sophistication of the writers' insights, and their literary talent.
                    On all three counts, Beecham's account is absolutely first rate.</p>
            <p>Beecham's war is highly dramatic, beginning with his enlistment as a private in the distinguished
                    Second <placeName>

                    </placeName> Volunteers of the Iron Brigade. Although absent from the field on several occasions
                    because of illness, he participated in Burnside's Mud March and the battles of Chancellorsville and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was captured in the latter battle and imprisoned in the Confederate prison camp at
                    Belle Isle. Once exchanged, he volunteered to become an officer in a black regiment, and became a
                    first lieutenant in the 23rd U.S. Colored Troops, serving despite the Confederacy's threat to
                    execute captured officers of black regiments. Having trained his soldiers, he led them into the
                    bloody fiasco at the Crater, where he was wounded and again captured. Imprisoned in

               </placeName>, he escaped but later surrendered in order to take
                    advantage of an expected prisoner exchange. Resigning after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he returned to his wife. The family lived in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was a lawyer, insurance agent, and public employee and was always civically
                    involved.</p>
            <p>This colorful career serves as the outline of Beecham's story. To it he brings an unusual political
                    and social sophistication, a willingness <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-095-4-067"/> to speak candidly, and
                    a writer's Pft. Thus he flatly rejects the Lost Cause myth: that the Confederacy was noble, the war
                    romantic, and that slavery was not the underlying cause of the war. Believing that the war was about
                    freedom, Beecham was contemptuous of the southern cause for which "Davis planned, Lee
                    fought and Jackson prayed (p. xiv). He rejected the national glorification of Lee, "a man
                    who deserted the nation that educated him in the art wherein he was gfted, and turned the strength
                    of his genius against the sword of God and the might of his truth (p. xiv). Beecham believed
                    wholeheartedly in "the universal brotherhood of the human race" and was an admirer
                    of the black soldier who "came forward cheerfully and volunteered his strength, brawn, and
                    his heart's blood to save the honor of the flag that to his race had been a symbol of every
                    dishonor" (p. xvi). He regarded the black soldiers of his regiment as "the bravest
                    and best soldiers that ever lived" (p. 168).</p>

                  <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He argues that "though class, gender, and cultural issues require much more
                    research, the existing scholarship [on African American urban history] provides the intellectual
                    foundation for a new African American urban synthesis. The <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName> is an
                    excellent place to start because it holds great symbolic significance in African American
                    history" (p. xiii). The <placeName>

                    </placeName> divided slave and free labor and later the Jim Crow South from the North. It was a

                    </placeName>" promising passage to a better life.</p>
            <p>This work comprises three subdivisions of about fifty pages each—the expansion of
                    commercial and early industrial capitalism (1790-1860); emancipation, race, and industrialization
                    (1861—1914); and the industrial age (1914—1945). Trotter covers late
                    twentieth-century experiences in just ten pages. His previous research on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the relatively large amount of scholarship on black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> help explain why he treats those two cities more extensively than the other two.</p>
            <p>Trotter underscores the role of black workers in the transformation of black urban life, documents
                    the emergence of the black middle <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-095-4-068"/> class, shows the development
                    of interracial alliances, and offers comparisons and contrasts in the social history of these varied
                    cities. Black communities diverged in their experiences with racial violence and discrimination and
                    "along temporal, spatial, color, class, and gender lines" (p. xiv). Trotter
                    concludes, though, that several unifying themes emerged. While blacks "faced racial
                    hostility from whites and class, color, and social cleavages among themselves," they also
                    built "bridges across such social chasms and creat[edl new
                    communities…." At "the forefront… was the transformation of
                    southern agricultural workers into a new urban working class" (p. xv).</p>
            <p>Trotter offers thoughtful comparisons of four black communities along a common waterway. Some gaps
                    appear, though. Trotter rarely mentions racial violence after 1861. Whites' roles in ameliorating
                    racism need more attention, as do differing population trends. For example, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s black population, like that of all lower <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> towns except <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, declined between 1900 and 1910 and remained flat until World War 11. The book's chief
                    limitation, however, is not the author's fault. There are relatively few historical studies of
                    African American life in the <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName>.</p>
            <p>This book should be a catalyst for further research on urban experiences since 1945, smaller cities
                    and towns, and the dynamics of race and community-building on either side of the river. Also
                    Trotter's "proletarianization" thesis needs more careful scrutiny. If <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> is a case in point, many African Americans had been employed in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. In his own words, Schneirov contends that "class formation among late
                    nineteenth-century workers had a profound and transformative impact <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-095-4-069"/> on the urban political system" (p. 3). This impact, however,
                    amounts to more than the various manifestations of labor and socialist parties during this period.
                    Rather, Schneirov argues that by looking beyond the "formal outcomes of elections"
                    to the processes of coalition-building, electoral appeals, policies of local government, and the
                    relationship between labor leaders, politicians, and officeholders, one can see a more enduring
                    political effect of class formation within the Democratic and Republican parties, especially after
                    1886. In this process, organized labor, the labor question, and pro-labor policies attained
                    political credibility, electoral appeal, and legitimacy in respectable discourse. By the end of the
                    nineteenth century, a transformed liberalism became "America's ‘via
                    media,’ great compromise, or merger between market liberalism and socialism" (p.
                    10).</p>
            <p>The book's structure works well to demonstrate Schneirov's basic argument. It begins with a
                    reconstruction of the basic setting of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> following the Civil War and captures nicely extant organization and consciousness of
                    the city's workers during this period. After detailing the development of party politics after the
                    war, Schneirov discusses the Great Upheaval of 1877 and the rise of the Knights of Labor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, including an interesting account of the organization's segmented and ethnic
                    characteristics. Perhaps the most insightful section of the book deals with the dissolution of
                    machine politics and the Knights, under the pressure of calls for liberal and radical reform through
                    the Eight-hour-day movement and the Haymarket tragedy, and eventually, the rise of
                    "modern" trade unions. Schneirov uses the final chapters of the text to
                    substantiate his argument concerning the transformation of liberalism in the aftermath of Haymarket
                    and the development of three new elements of liberal reform, namely, a revised conception of social
                    ethics, a newfound acceptance of class legislation, and limited public support for the regulation of
                    the market by associations of capital and labor.</p>
            <p>In all, Schneirov's well-researched and well-written <hi rend="i">Labor and Urban Politics</hi> gives
                    cause for historians of American politics during the Gilded Age to reconsider the labor issue
                    outside of the threadbare question of "why no socialism?" As such, Schneirov's
                    work contributes to the new institutionalist turn in the literature that seeks to retain the
                    richness and conceptual insights of the "new history" without sacrificing careful
                    consideration of organizations and leaders that contributed so much to the historical possibilities
                    of the past. Instead of a golden past, or in Schneirov's words "a tragedy of lost
                    opportunities," <hi rend="i">Labor and Urban Politics</hi> focuses on what occurred in the
                    political arena and, more importantly, what endured.</p>

            <p>Sports historians have been good to professional baseball in the past three decades, turning out
                    numerous biographies of legendary players and accounts of great teams and their seasons. But aside
                    from the members of the Professional Football Researchers Association writing for other members, the
                    historians, lay and academic alike, have given scant attention to professional football, a newcomer
                    on the American sports scene, devoid of baseball's mystique. Now appearing, though, are several
                    useful books on the game, including a biography of Red Grange, two comprehensive encyclopedias, a
                    history of the origins and early development of the game, a study of professional teams in the
                        <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> in the 1920s, and the work reviewed here, Keith McClellan's <hi rend="i">The Sunday Game: At the Dawn of Professional Football.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>McClellan opens his study with four chapters on the state of independent football, the game played by
                    adults without collegiate affiliation, early in the twentieth century. He notes the blue collar
                    support for it, the gambling and use of ringers associated with it, and the class prejudice against
                    it. Using exhaustive research in newspapers, he then chronicles—game-by-game, score
                    by-score—the play of twenty independent teams in the upper Midwest from 1915 to 1917. He
                    sees 1915 as a benchmark because organizers of independent clubs, heretofore facing anarchic
                    conditions in recruiting players, who switched teams week-by-week, and in arranging solid schedules,
                    began to play interstate rivals regularly, to commit players to longer contracts, and to consider
                    creation of leagues governing conditions of competition. America's entry into World War I halted
                    progress, but the independents, McClellan asserts, laid the foundation for the National Football
                    League. He closes with an excellent analysis of the role professional football played in giving sons
                    of working class families opportunities to break down social barriers, a view of
                    "stars" in the game, and a summary of the substance of promotion and financing of
                    the game.</p>
            <p>McClellan sees a linear movement from the growing professionalism of 1915-1917 to the day that
                    proprietors of the independents met in 1920 to organize the American Professional Football
                    Association, which became the NFL in 1922. But the founding fathers still faced some of the same
                    problems—players jumping from one team to another and schedules in shambles. As one
                    historian has put it, professional football remained a "catch as-catch-can
                    operation" (Harold Claassen, <hi rend="i">The History of Professional Football</hi>,
                    Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1963, p. 32). Darkness yet awaited the dawn.</p>
            <p>Readers interested in specific teams will find The Sunday Game useful, because it offers encyclopedic
                    detail on the twenty independents. <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-095-4-071"/> The detail, however, becomes
                    cumbersome because of McClellan's organization of his material. In his chapter on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Triangles, for instance, he uses a full page (p. 124) to describe a game between the
                    Triangles and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> Heralds played in 1916. Then in the chapter on the Heralds, he spends nearly a full
                    page (p. 147) on the same game. Similar repetition occurs throughout the middle chapters. The mass
                    of detail on games and scores inevitably invites errors. On page 92, for example, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> Panhandles led the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Maroons 7-6 but won 23-0. In the appendix (pp. 415 and 4531, the Panhandles won 23-7.
                    Other such discrepancies appear elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Despite the doubtfulness of his principal argument and organizational problems, McClellan has made a
                    substantial contribution to the literature on professional football. No other work deals with the
                    game in the second decade of the twentieth century in such a comprehensive way, and no other work is
                    likely to supplant it.</p>

            <p>Robert Hall's fascinating and provocative book is the sort of work that indulges in speculation and
                    creatively crosses disciplinary boundaries. Although the book is written by an archaeologist with a
                    deep knowledge of native North American cultural history, nonspe-cialists can read it with great
                    interest, even if not equipped to fully grasp all the fine points. The title effectively expresses
                    Hall's late-career turn "away from conventional field archaeology toward a more humanistic,
                    noninvasive archaeology emphasizing Native American spirituality" (p. x). The fact that his
                    maternal ancestors include Mohicans, Menominees, and Ottawas grounds the book in a personal sense of
                    connection to his materials and enhances its expressive as well as its scholarly quality.</p>
            <p>To do "noninvasive archaeology" is to work with museum and documentary collections.
                    The archaeologist "reads" them as one would read texts: to elucidate the stories
                    that they can tell. One can do amazing things with what lies in museums, archives, and libraries, or
                    is embedded in native languages and vocabularies, without having to dig and destroy more sites, or
                    remove still more heirlooms from native communities. This is Hall's moral and methodological double
                    message: take seriously and analyze deeply what is already at hand.</p>
            <p>The content of the book is remarkably rich. Hall's starting point is the Calumet ceremony or the
                    rites surrounding the pipe and the long pipestem. He analyzes meanings through archaeological,
                    historical, <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-095-4-072"/> and linguistic studies and comparisons across North
                    America. In nineteen chapters, Hall shows how the ceremony is intertwined with mourning,
                    consolation, adoption, reincarnation, ideas surrounding spirit bundles, soul release, cosmogony, and
                    sacrifice, particularly the Skiri Pawnee Morning Star sacrifice, in which Hall also finds
                    relationships with Mesoamerican cosmology. He argues that cultural diffusion and integration of
                    motifs and artifacts into various communities across the continent are very old and pervasive
                    processes in native North America. In short, the spread of modern powwow dances or other
                    contemporary observances has analogues going back two or three thousand years.</p>
            <p>The work is handsomely presented and printed, with numerous linecuts and diagrams. Readers would
                    benefit if the illustrations and their titles were listed at the front. Given their importance, they
                    deserve as much. The book could have used some further editing to reduce repetition and enhance
                    clarity. But it is a creative and path-breaking contribution worthy of attention from all readers
                    interested in native North American history and culture.</p>

            <p>The life of the Moravian missionary David Zeisberger (1721-1808) is a subject rich in primary sources
                    and worthy of study. Zeisberger's writings are a major source of information for anyone interested
                    in Algonquian and Iroquoian peoples in the eighteenth century. As a missionary for sixty-three
                    years, Zeisberger became a noted linguist of the northern Unami <placeName>

                    </placeName> dialect. He also compiled an Onondaga dictionary and studied Mohawk. His letters,
                    diaries, and other manuscripts provide detailed accounts of life among the Indians of
                            <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In writing <hi rend="i">David Zeisberger: A Life among the Indians</hi>, Earl P. Olmstead has taken
                    on a daunting task, given the range of Zeisberger's writings and the longevity of his mission. This
                    task is complicated because, as Olmstead is aware, Zeisberger himself is not the whole story. The
                    Moravian missions were hardly a one man operation. Many other Moravian missionaries labored
                    alongside Zeisberger, and Moravian church authorities directed his efforts. Olmstead goes into much
                    detail about these individuals and their activities. As a result, this book sometimes reads like a
                    biography of Zeisberger and other times like a narrative of Moravian missions in general. The <pb n="395" id="VAA4025-095-4-073"/> reader is left with a sense of confused purpose, which some
                    introductory comments from the author might have alleviated.</p>
            <p>One would expect a heavy use of primary sources since so many are available for this topic.
                    Especially for the period after 1767, Olm-stead does make use of many Moravian letters and diaries.
                    He relies on English translations of Moravian records, once only available in German script. By
                    tracking down and commissioning English translations of sources, Olmstead has made many Moravian
                    records more accessible to researchers. Interested scholars would benefit from mining his footnotes.
                    Although he turns to numerous primary sources for the years after 1767, he bases a large portion of
                    his account of Zeisberger's earlier life on fairly old secondary materials. This gives an uneven
                    quality to his study. No doubt there are fewer sources for this early period, but given the
                    Moravians' penchant for record-keeping, it is likely that other primary sources could help fill in
                    the picture.</p>
            <p>Readers who like studying maps and trails will enjoy Olmstead's book. He has retraced the Moravians'
                    footsteps, using the missionaries' many travel diaries. As a result one gets a strong sense of place
                    as he connects present locales with previous Moravian sites.</p>
            <p>Zeisberger's life history offers plenty of excitement. Olmstead dwells primarily on the years just
                    before and during the American Revolution, which were especially tumultuous for the missionary and
                    the missions in general. He gives a blow-by-blow description of this period. The book only briefly
                    summarizes the last twenty-odd years of Zeisberger's life. For a narrative of this period Olmstead
                    expects the reader to turn to his earlier book, <hi rend="i">Blackcoats among the Delawares: David
                        Zeisberger on the <placeName>

            <p>Olmstead attacks his subject with enthusiasm and works hard to uncover the paths and byways of the
                    Moravians. This is, however, an uneven biography. One hopes that someday someone will delve deeper,
                    for instance, into the childhood, youth, and young adulthood of David Zeisberger. Such a study might
                    shed more light on the missionary's crucial decisions during the upheavals in the <placeName>

            <p>In this monograph, Allen Jayne attempts to analyze Jefferson's intentions and sources in composing
                    the Declaration. In doing so, he concludes that the philosophical works of Henry St. John, Viscount
                    Bolingbroke, and of Henry Home, Lord Kames, were as decisive in shaping Jefferson's theological and
                    moral views as were Locke's writings in giving direction to Jefferson's politics.</p>
            <pb n="396" id="VAA4025-095-4-074"/>
            <p>Jayne notes in his introductory comments that one of the primary goals of his monograph is to
                    demonstrate the crucial importance of Jefferson's theology in shaping the political theory of the
                    Declaration. But other than pointing out that Jefferson embraced deistic views and had read and been
                    influenced by Bolingbroke, facts already brought to our attention by Gilbert Chinard and Sydney
                    Ahlstrom, the author offers little that is either new or significant. Certainly there is no support
                    for Jayne's assertion that "there were few if any members of the Congress, other than
                    Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who shared the deist religious views Jefferson expressed in the
                    [Declaration]" (p. 56). Nor does the author offer a convincing case that Jefferson's
                    religious convictions informed the whole of the Declaration.</p>
            <p>The author does no better when analyzing the moral and political philosophy underlying Jefferson's
                    treatment of rights. Jayne argues that the reason Jefferson, unlike Locke, excluded property from
                    his listing of inalienable rights was that, unlike life and liberty, property was indeed alienable
                    because it could be transferred to others. The author's analysis, however, confuses a right to
                    property with a right to specific property. While a specific instance of property over which one has
                    ownership can be sold, traded, transferred, or even destroyed, in sum "alienated,"
                    the "right to property" remains as "inalienable" as rights to
                    life and liberty. However, the author's confusion over the nature of inalienability of property
                    leads him to conclude that Jefferson must have had Lord Kames's discussion of property in <hi rend="i">Historical Law Tracts</hi> in mind when he substituted the term "pursuit of
                    happiness" for property in his trilogy of fundamental rights. There is, however, no
                    historical warrant to support this contention. A far more likely explanation for why Jefferson
                    invoked a right to pursue happiness is that he borrowed the phrase from the opening paragraph of
                    George Mason's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Declaration of Rights, a document with which he was familiar and a copy of which he
                    might well have had before him when composing the Declaration.</p>
            <p>Not only does Jayne not prove his larger thesis, but his essay is replete with smaller errors. For
                    example, in contrasting the Lock-ean interpretation of the Declaration with a classical republican
                    reading of the document, the author describes classical republicanism in terms perfectly consistent
                    with Lockean theory. The author, in characterizing classical republicanism as it is understood by J.
                    G. A. Pocock and others, totally omits its most significant attribute, a distrust of trade and
                    wealth unsecured by real property. The result is an understanding of classical republicanism that is
                    so broad as to include every Whig theorist, including Locke.</p>
            <p>Appended to Jayne's text is a reprint of the final version of the Declaration. Like much of the rest
                    of the book, this makes little sense. Why, in an essay devoted to Jefferson's philosophical
                    intentions reflected in the Declaration, are we not provided Jefferson's draft rather than the
                    document as amended by Congress?</p>

            <p>In sum, <hi rend="i">Jefferson's Declaration of Independence</hi> is a disappointing book. It
                    rehashes material more clearly and thoroughly presented elsewhere, contains controversial assertions
                    for which no evidence is adduced, and is salted with errors of fact and interpretation. Those who
                    wish to know about the philosophical underpinnings of the nation's most important political document
                    are better advised to go elsewhere.</p>

                    responsibilities in Natchez, Rodney crossed the Appalachians and helped crew the custom-built Iris
                    down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <geogName>Mississippi rivers</geogName>. His journey lasted from August 14 to
                    December 1, 1803, including seventy-one days on water. Although Rodney's checkered life included a
                    stint in debtors' prison, he was well-connected, intelligent, well-read, intrepid,
                    insightful—and prone to exaggeration. His travel journal reveals his passion for history,
                    geology, botany, zoology, river dynamics, archaeology, social questions, and morbidity. His journey
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> to Natchez was more than simple travel; it was a rite of passage, one that dispelled
                    burdens and opened new worlds.</p>
            <p>Boatmate conversations, fiddle and flute music, and his journal enlivened Rodney's spirits.
                    Reflecting prevailing thought, Rodney lamented that western soil "is fine but in the hands
                    of Indians…" (p. 158). Observing some assimilation of Indians, he also noted a
                    white woman and her Indian husband. Rodney delighted in the unfolding natural and social
                    environments and bubbled with expectation, awe, and mystery. Faulty guide books heightened the
                    mystery.</p>
            <p>Rodney recorded much: peaceful contacts with Indians, ubiquitous alcohol, "uncultured <placeName>

                    "frenzy and shouting and falling down" like Methodists (p. 411, an "air

                    Indian mounds, a "hansome blackeyed" river "nimph" (p. 97), the

                    travelers and local denizens, a backwoodsman's family refusing to migrate to <placeName>

                    strumpets, and flora and fauna, but virtually no deer, bear, or insects.</p>
            <p>In fact, much is revealed by what is not in the journal: murders, scrapes with Indians, predators,
                    mean-spirited people, and other conflict. Attentive to detail and quick to spot troubles, Rodney
                    would have noted violence had it occurred. Although his mates took potshots at raccoons, ducks,
                    pigeons, and other wildlife, no shot was fired in anger. His journal is virtually conflict-free and
                    abounds with instances of kindness and trust among strangers, Indians coming aboard, and perfect
                    strangers meeting and getting along well via ad hoc activities.</p>
            <p>Technically, this work is virtually flawless. Dwight L. Smith and Ray Swick employ a sensible
                    editorial policy. Endnotes illuminate significant people and places, idioms, context, and
                    historiographical material. The editors, moreover, make modest claims and readily admit
                    uncertainties. Nine illustrations, four adequate maps, an index, and rich primary and secondary
                    sources (including material on epidemiology) grace the work. Although one could wish that Rodney had
                    recorded far fewer sandbars and river bends, superb editing helps this work succeed.</p>

            <p>This volume is one of a series entitled American Profiles, edited by Norman K. Risjord, who explains
                    that he looks upon biography as "a pedagogical device," designed "to
                    sugarcoat the pill" of history (p. ix). Thus interpreted, biography is to provide
                    "a context for history," and the history here featured, according to Risjord, is
                    to center on the "debate whether American expansion meant that human slavery necessarily
                    went with it" (pp. ix, xv).</p>
            <p>It is questionable whether Lynn Hudson Parsons held so limited a view of the life of John Quincy
                    Adams. In fact, through the first six of eight chapters, until the discussion of Adams's
                    congressional career in the mid-1830s, the only passages that relate Adams's identification of the
                    slavery issue with American expansion are the accounts of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Purchase, when the author comments that Adams "was ambivalent, even
                    inconsistent" (p. 271, and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-095-4-077"/> Compromise, when although he opposed slavery and looked upon
                    the debate as "the title-page to a great tragic volume," he "for the most
                    part… kept these thoughts to himself' (p. 161). Parsons identifies Adams's struggle in
                    opposition to the "gag" rule, which banned reading of antislavery petitions before
                    Congress, as a transition to "a new phase" in his career (p. 224).</p>
            <p>The volume provides an excellent chronological survey of Adams's public life, a balanced account that
                    covers the entire career in a mere 268 pages, and a brief epilogue on the major achievements of his
                    descendants. The author writes smoothly and organizes her material effectively. Such compactness,
                    however, leaves little space for interpretation. Three themes command the bulk of her attention:
                    Adams's strong nationalism, his eighteenth-century conceptions of political ethics, and his ultimate
                    identification as an antislavery proponent.</p>
            <p>Adams's heritage as the son of one of the country's founders gave him a patriotic nationalism, but he
                    adapted it into territorial expansionism, cultural and scientific advancement, commercial growth,
                    and governmental facilitation of such development. Parsons accepts the view that Adams recognized
                    the affinity of his programmatic goals to the policies supported by Henry Clay, rather than to the
                    increasingly regionalized conceptions of the other presidential candidates in 1824. She also notes
                    that Adams's political ineffectiveness sprang in large part from his beliefs that persons with
                    talent and experience had a responsibility to enter public service and that their capabilities
                    should draw public support without self promotion, even to the extent of tolerating disloyal
                    subordinates. Parsons seems, however, unable to explain the "change" she finds in
                    the vehemence of Adams's attacks upon slavery during his congressional career when it had not
                    earlier been apparent. She attributes it less to his opposition to slavery than to the restraints
                    upon free speech imposed by congressional spokesmen for the slavocracy. She does not recognize that
                    by the 1830s Adams had become convinced that his whole national program had succumbed to southern
                    efforts to preserve "the clanking chain of the Slave" through "boundless
                    bribery to the west…" (Edward H. Tate, Jr., "Ten Unpublished letters of
                    John Quincy Adams," <hi rend="i">

            <p>The volume lacks documentation, a deficiency most relevant to the limited dicussion provided on
                    Adams's private life. Parsons's allusions to father John Adams's correspondence with his son add a
                    fresh dimension to the more commonly cited Adams record, but at the same time they minimize the
                    domineering role frequently attributed to mother Abigail. Parsons describes Adams as socially boring
                    and ill at ease, strange characteristics for so experienced a diplomat. Elsewhere his conversational
                    skills in small gatherings have been acclaimed. He seems to have led a somewhat boisterous life as a
                    young lawyer; his letters to his wife during periods of extended separation verge <pb n="400" id="VAA4025-095-4-078"/> on the erotic; and the Adamses were a popular young couple at the
                    Prussian and Russian courts, an experience that served him well in his diplomatic career. Scholars
                    who find such detail important must search in vain for explanations of such discrepancies.
                    Manifestly designed to attract the general reader, the volume will serve that audience well.</p>

                    many of her contemporaries. His book is a well researched and fascinating biography as well as an
                    important view of Jacksonian politics. Though undoubtedly not intended to relate to recent affairs
                    of officeholders, it may interest readers all the more because of the timing of its publication.</p>
            <p>O'Neale was well known to Andrew Jackson and his friend John Eaton when they both came to the capital
                    in the 1820s and took lodging at her father's popular inn. They were fascinated by the attractive
                    Margaret, who was married to John Timberlake, who died in 1828 while on naval duty abroad. According
                    to rumor Eaton carried on an affair with Margaret before he married her.</p>
            <p>Jackson soon became president and maintained his interest in the couple. In time, his friendliness
                    became a determination to protect Margaret from the kind of slander his own wife had recently
                    suffered, which, he believed, had driven her to an early grave. Increasingly, this feeling took on
                    political importance during Jackson's presidency.</p>
            <p>When the wives of cabinet members refused to have anything to do with Margaret, the furious president
                    hauled the secretaries to the White House for correction. If their wives did not socialize with
                    Margaret, he thundered, he would dismiss any or all of his cabinet members. He dismissed or received
                    resignations from all except for Secretary of State Martin <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren. Furthermore, he also broke relations with Vice President John C. Calhoun, whom
                    Jackson suspected was largely responsible for this social injustice. This was a novel reason for
                    dismissing a cabinet.</p>
            <pb n="401" id="VAA4025-095-4-079"/>
            <p>Thus the political significance of this development was the promotion of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren's prospects for presidential succession and the growth of anti-Calhoun
                    sentiments. The author is on credible ground in this respect but perhaps underemphasizes issues of
                    public policy, such as the tariff or national banking. He does show that Henry Clay did not attack
                    Jackson personally, but he might have given more attention to the politics of economic policy, as
                    well as to the personal impact of the Margaret O'Neale affair.</p>
            <p>Overall, this is an excellent book, which brings in some interesting views of O'Neale's long life in <placeName>

            <p>Few in the annals of American diplomacy have accomplished as much and received so little credit in
                    their own lifetime as Nicholas Trist. A Democrat who married Thomas Jefferson's granddaughter, Trist
                    became chief clerk of the state department in the Polk administration. During the Mexican War, Polk
                    and Secretary of State James Buchanan sent him to join the American forces in Mexico with
                    instructions to negotiate a peace treaty. Polk, of course, distrusted General Winfield Scott, a
                    Whig, and expected the presence of the trustworthy Trist to diminish the ambitious general's
                    presidential prospects.</p>
            <p>Despite initial misunderstandings, Trist and Scott developed an effective working relationship. Polk
                    grew as suspicious of Trist as he was of Scott and, leaning toward the All Mexico movement, recalled
                    the diplomat just as he was on the verge of reaching an agreement with Mexican authorities. The
                    "defiant peacemaker" ignored the recall notice and concluded the Treaty of
                    Guadalupe Hidalgo. Displeased, Polk sent the treaty to the Senate for ratification but extracted his
                    revenge by refusing to pay Trist for the time he remained in Mexico after he received his recall.</p>
            <p>Financial problems dogged Trist for years. Dismissed from government service, he eventually became
                    paymaster for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Wilmington, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad, a modest position that required constant travel over the often uncomfortable
                    and frequently dangerous rail system. His life improved in 1870, when <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> senator Charles Sumner took up his cause and won for Trist not only the back pay owed
                    him, but interest as well. Soon after he was awarded a comfortable sinecure as postmaster of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, where he lived comfortably until his death in 1873.</p>
            <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-095-4-080"/>
            <p>Wallace Ohrt relates Trist's story in a lively and engaging manner. The best and most original aspect
                    of this book involves the details of Trist's close and loving relationship with his wife, Virginia,
                    and their children, drawn from the Trist papers in the microfilm Southern Women and Their Families
                    series in the Southern Historical Collection at the University of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>

                        <settlement type="city">Chapel Hill</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the book has more defects than virtues. It lacks focus. The title indicates that the
                    book is about Trist in the Mexican War, but more than half of the text is about Trist before his
                    appointment as chief clerk. When the author does get to the war with Mexico, the research is thin.
                    The book relies on previously published materials for evidence, and the author's treatment adds
                    little to those earlier works. One significant newer effort the author does not consider is Drew
                    McCoy's <hi rend="i">Last of the Fathers: James <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                        </placeName> and the Republican Legacy</hi> (1989), which includes valuable insights into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s influence on Trist's political views.</p>
            <p>There are a number of slipshod errors. Ohrt wrongly places Jefferson and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> together at the Constitutional Convention, while Jefferson was minister to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> (p. 3). He incorrectly asserts that Scott "had taken part in negotiating the
                    Treaty of Ghent" (p. 110). Ohrt writes that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Trist's brother "disappeared into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> Territory" where he became an aide to the "territorial
                    governor" in the 1830s, when <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> became a state in 1796. Finally he declares that the state department employed
                    "four or five hundred" clerks while the actual number for the diplomatic,
                    consular, and home bureaus combined amounted to fourteen plus a handful of temporary clerks from
                    time to time (pp. 60' 99).</p>
            <p>These limitations seriously weaken the usefulness of this volume. Readers who wish to know more about
                    Trist's role in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo would be better advised to read the already existing
                    literature.</p>

                    $49.95; paperbound, $29.95.) A coffee table book, if there ever was one.
                    Hoover organizes Hoosier history topically and covers such areas as Native Americans, the pioneer
                    period, the Civil War, agriculture, the growth of towns and cities, business, leisure, sports, and
                    education. Readers not familiar with the history of the state will find these concise chapters
                    useful; those more familiar with the history will still find much to interest them in the topical
                    organization of the information. Even after reading the text, however, many people will find
                    themselves coming back to the book again and again for the photographs. Anyone interested in
                    transportation history will treasure photographs of the steamboat <hi rend="i">Governor Morton</hi>

                    Carmichael at the piano surrounded by college friends (among them Herman B Wells). Photographs range
                    from the serious (an artillery battery organized at Indiana University during World War I) to the
                    amusing (a business-suited Governor Henry F. Shricker milking an unhappy-looking cow). The volume's
                    only defect is its lack of an index. Perhaps, given the topical arrangement of the chapters, a
                    textual index is not strictly necessary, but a photographic index would have been an invaluable
                    addition. <hi rend="i">Dawn Bakken, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    Subsequent sections present a large collection of postcard images, arranged by subject and captioned
                    by the author. Topics include the railroad landscape, depots, trains and people, and the electric
                    age. Indiana readers will be particularly interested in photographic postcards of Inland Steel
                    railyards in early twentieth-century northwest Indiana, and several illustrations of interurban
