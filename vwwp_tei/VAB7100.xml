                    <l><hi rend="b">THE</hi> grass was gray with the moonlit dew,</l>
                    <l>The stones were white as I came through;</l>
                    <l>I came down the path by the thirteen yews,</l>
                    <l>Through the blocks of shade that the moonlight hews.</l>
                    <l>And when I came to the high lych-gate</l>
                    <l>I waited awhile where the corpses wait;</l>
                    <l>Then I came down the road where the moonlight lay</l>
                    <l>Like the fallen ghost of the light of day.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>The bats shrieked high in their zigzag flight,</l>
                    <l>The owls' spread wings were quiet and white,</l>
                    <l>The wind and the poplar gave sigh for sigh,</l>
                    <l>And all about were the rustling shy</l>
                    <l>Little live creatures that love the nightâ</l>
                    <l>Little wild creatures timid and free.</l>
                    <l>I passed, and they were not afraid of me.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>It was over the meadow and down the lane</l>
                    <l>The way to come to my house again:</l>
                    <l>Through the wood where the lovers talk,</l>
                    <l>And the ghosts, they say, get leave to walk.</l>
                    <l>I wore the clothes that we all must wear,</l>
                    <l>And no one saw me walking there,</l>
                    <l>No one saw my pale feet pass</l>
                    <l>By my garden path to my garden grass.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>My garden was hung with the veil of springâ</l>
                    <l>Plum-tree and pear-tree blossoming;</l>
                    <l>It lay in the moon's cold sheet of light</l>
                    <l>In garlands and silence, wondrous and white</l>
                    <l>As a dead bride decked for her burying.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Then I saw the face of my house</l>
                    <l>Held close in the arms of the blossomed boughs:</l>
                    <l>I leaned my face to the window bright</l>
                    <l>To feel if the heart of my house beat right.</l>
                    <l>The firelight hung it with fitful gold;</l>
                    <l>It was warm as the house of the dead is cold.</l>
                    <l>I saw the settles, the candles tall,</l>
                    <l>The black-faced presses against the wall,</l>
                    <l>Polished beechwood and shining brass,</l>
                    <l>The gleam of china, the glitter of glass,</l>
                    <l>All the little things that were home to meâ</l>
                    <l>Everything as it used to be.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Then I said, âThe fire of life still burns,</l>
                    <l>And I have returned whence none returns:</l>
                    <l>I will warm my hands where the fire is lit,</l>
                    <l>I will warm my heart in the heart of it!â</l>
                    <l>So I called aloud to the one within:</l>
                    <l>âOpen, open, and let me in!</l>
                    <l>Let me in to the fire and the lightâ</l>
                    <l>It is very cold out here in the night!â</l>
                    <l>There was never a stir or an answering breathâ</l>
                    <l>Only a silence as deep as death.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Then I beat on the window, and called, and cried.</l>
                    <l>No one heard me, and none replied.</l>
                    <l>The golden silence lay warm and deep,</l>
                    <l>And I wept as the dead, forgotten, weep;</l>
                    <l>And there was no one to hear or seeâ</l>
                    <l>To comfort me, to have pity on me.</l>
                </lg>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>But deep in the silence something stirredâ</l>
                    <l>Something that had not seen or heardâ</l>
                    <l>And two drew near to the window-pane,</l>
                    <l>Kissed in the moonlight and kissed again,</l>
                    <l>And looked, through my face, to the moon-shroud, spread</l>
                    <l>Over the garlanded garden bed;</l>
                    <l>AndââHow ghostly the moonlight is!â she said.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Back through the garden, the wood, the lane,</l>
                    <l>I came to mine own place again.</l>
                    <l>I wore the garments we all must wear,</l>
                    <l>And no one saw me walking there.</l>
                    <l>No one heard my thin feet pass</l>
                    <l>Through the white of the stones and the gray of the grass,</l>
                    <l>Along the path where the moonlight hews</l>
                    <l>Slabs of shadow for thirteen yews.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>In the hollow where drifted dreams lie deep</l>
                    <l>It is good to sleep: it was good to sleep:</l>
                    <l>But my bed has grown cold with the drip of the dew,</l>
                    <l>And I cannot sleep as I used to do.</l>
