                    I would forsake the beaten thoroughfares,
                    The rutted roads down which the rabble ride;
                    Behold the byways beckon--unawares--
                    They seem to whisper, "Come! The world is
                    wide;
                    On chartless seas, spread your undaunted sails,
                    And fare forth boldly on untravelled trails! "
                
                
                    If Man is truly "master of his fate,"
                    And the unchallenged " Captain of his soul,"
                    Perchance the byways and " the Streets called
                    Straight
                    May find their ending at the selfsame goal;
                    I woud not deem one pathway orthodox,
                    And bar all others with unyielding locks.
                
                
                    So let us leave the busy roads behind,
                    And seek the byaths, overgrown with grass,--
                    Their silence and their solitude are kind;
                    Whalt matter whether few or many pass!
                    Each soul must seek, alone, its Holy Grails
                    By questing bravely on untravelled trails.

                        PRETENDING AWAY THE YEARS
                        
                            "JUST pretendin'"--we
                                have smiled
                            Often at the little child,
                            As it spends its care-free days
                            Mimicing its elders' ways,
                            Aping grown folks' joys and woes,
                            "Togging up " in grown folks' clothes,
                            Speaking grown-up talk that drips
                            Oddly from its lisping lips;
                            It's a pretty game, you'll own,
                            "Just pretendin'" you are grown!
                        
                        
                            Now, when many years have passed,
                            And we're truly grown at last,
                            It would seem a charming play
                            To "pretend" the years away!
                            Could such innocent pretence
                            Bring back childhood's innocence--
                            Cleanse the stains that have defiled,
                            " Even as a little child"--
                            We might well, with tear-wet lids,
                            "Just pretend" that we were
                                "kids."
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE FIRST STEPS
                        
                            WHEN "Baby" took his first few
                                steps alone,
                            We watched the wondrous feat with eager eyes--
                            Who would have thought that even our "ownest
                            own"
                            Could show such superhuman enterprise!
                        
                        
                            How young he was when he could "patty-cake,"
                            And gurgle things interpreted as talk,
                            Then, creeping, leave destruction in his wake--
                            But what was that to learning how to walk!
                        
                        
                            Nor thought we then how far, in future years,
                            The little, toddling feet might go astray--
                            No time was that for idle thoughts or fears,
                            Sufficient is the evil to its day!
                        
                        
                            We placed the little monarch on his throne,
                            And in obeisance humbly bent the knee;
                            When "Baby" took his first few steps alone,
                            It was a wondrous thing to you and me.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        BABIES
                        
                            I LIKE to play around the barn
                                'n' gather up the
                            eggs,
                            'N' watch the weenty calves run 'round
                                'n' kick
                            their wobbly legs;
                            I fairly love a little calf, till I remember how
                            Before you know it it is grown, and just a horrid
                            cow.
                        
                        
                            'N' when I watch the little pigs, I holler with
                            delight,
                            T' see the little fellows p'tend they're
                                mad, and
                            fight;
                            They're so cute I've got to love 'em, but
                                my love
                            goes to the dogs,
                            To find in just a little while, they're greedy, grown
                            up hogs!
                        
                        
                            I like to watch the little lambs, 'n' listen to
                                'em
                            bleat,
                            They jump around so funny on their clumsy
                            lookin' feet--
                            But I've never felt so friendly with the gentle little
                            lamb,
                            Since the time I got bumped over by a hateful,
                            cross, old ram!
                        
                        
                            I watch old Fanny's little colt 'at runs and
                                kicks
                            his heels,
                            'N' shakes his woozly, woolly tail, to show how
                            good he feels--
                            
                            He's awful cute an' funny, but he grows so
                                fast,
                            of course,
                            'At I'm 'fraid, before I know it,
                                'at he'll be a
                            grown up horse!
                        
                        
                            I love a little chicken, while it's just a ball of fuzz,
                            'N' goes around a-peepin', in the comic
                                way it does,
                            But I know as well as you do 'at the time's
                                a-comin'
                            when
                            It'll be a proud old rooster, or a cross
                                'n' fussy
                            hen.
                        
                        
                            I love little, cooin' babies, with their tiny hands
                            'n' feet,
                            'N' all their cunnin' ways, I think, are
                                awful hard
                            to beat;
                            But if I could just have my way, I'd let
                                well
                            enough alone,
                            For they're nicer when they're little than
                                they'll
                            be when they are grown!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        IN THE INTERPRETER'S HOUSE
                        
                            CAN'T he talk plain! And only two years
                                old--
                            It's wonderful! And you should hear him sing!
                            He understands 'most everything he's told,
                            And he can say just almost anything!
                        
                        
                            What's that he says? Good lord, you ought to
                            know--
                            Why, anyone would know that
                                "hootoo's' food!
                            He could say that an awful while ago,
                            And I tell you, he thinks his "hootoo's"
                                good!
                        
                        
                            "Hapse any amps," why, that's
                                    "have any
                             lambs"--
                            You know the song about "Baa, Baa, Black
                            Sheep."
                            It's wonderful, sometimes, how music calms
                            That little tad and puts him off to sleep!
                        
                        
                            " Apaps "--that's rabbit--surely you can tell--

                            Why, sir, that boy could almost learn to
                                spell--
                            It's simply wonderful how much he
                                knows!
                        
                        
                            "Seetbooloand"--you surely understand--
                            He's singing--don't you know the
                                words and
                            tune
                            That old, familiar hymn, " Sweet Beulah Land

                            What! "Oonce?"--you ought to know that
                            that means moon!

                            That's "shut up," as the neighbor children
                                say!

                        It's wonderful! And you should hear him sing!

                            Remorse so smites my soul, I must my sin atone.
                            No hardened burglar I, but oh, my need was great!
                            When such temptations try, who can resist his
                            fate?
                            True, the relentless law might never try the case--
                            No judge with stern set jaw confront me, face
                            to face;

                            Its burden staggers me, and hourly greater grows.
                            The owner sobbed and sobbed--"O, my offense

                            I THINK its mean as mean can be, of

                                at all, like they do
                            baby brother;
                            It's jus' as plain as anything--there
                                couldn't no
                            one doubt it;
                            They showed it, too, this mornin', an'
                                I'm jus'
                            heart broke about it!
                        
                        
                            W'en baby pulls my papa's hair, er
                                kicks him with
                            his feet,
                            W'y, papa only pats his head an' says,
                                "Now
                            ain't he sweet?"
                            Then baby pounds my mamma too, an' pulls her
                            nose er ear,
                            An' mamma sits an' kisses him an, says,
                                " Ain't he
                            a dear? "
                        
                        
                            Now since they 'pear t' like it so, I
                                thought 'at
                            I'u'd try it;
                            I guess I never will again--it almost caused a
                            riot;
                            I pulled pa's hair an', kicked him
                                an'--boo-hoo

                            T' fnish the experiment, I pulled my

                            I don't know yet what happened--an'
                                never will
                            I s'pose -

                                mudded--but this much
                            is mighty clear,
                            That mamma didn't kiss me er say,
                                "Ain't she a

                            I did jus' like the baby, an' they say
                                he's sweet

                            boo-hoo, BOO-HOO!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL
                        
                            OUR "baby" starts to school,
                                to-day,
                            With eager feet and dancing eyes--
                            'Tis strangely still, with her away,
                            And strangely slow each hour flies.
                        
                        
                            The silence brings the spirit rest,
                            And yet its quietness I rue--
                            It whispers how the old home nest
                            Will seem, shared just by me and you.
                        
                        
                            But then the little feet must start
                            Upon the long and untried way--
                            So be it that with sturdy heart
                            Our "baby" starts to school to-day.

                            I LIKE to tease my playmates, though I
                                shouldn't,
                            I suppose;
                             tease 'em 'bout their parents
                                'n' I tease 'em

                            Oh, there's nothing that I like so well as

                            I tease 'em 'bout their lessons, if
                                they ever chance
                            to fail,
                            Or if they always know 'em, still I tease
                                'em tooth

                            I tease all mamma's callers till
                                they're 'most too

                            But I went to bed last evening , when my supper
                            was not light,
                            And I had a dream that gave me such an awful,
                            awful fright
                            That you'll never catch me teasin--oh, I had
                                a
                            dreadful night,

                            Every soul I ever teased at came 'n'
                                stood about
                            my bed;
                            They burnt we with hot pokers 'n' they
                                beat me
                            till I bled,
                            'N' they never stopped a minute till
                                they left me
                            there for dead--
                            So, like Postum advertisements --THERE'S A
                            
                            REASON!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SHOWING OFF
                        
                            YOU'VE noticed how, when strangers
                                come,
                            The children do unheard of things--
                            Such deeds as strike beholders dumb,
                            And make their peace of mind take wings.
                        
                        
                            The mother's face turns scarlet red,
                            The strangers glance away and cough,
                            While father wishes he were dead,
                            The children--they're just "
                                showing off."
                        
                        
                            Their elders wonder, they confess,
                            Why children never yet have thought
                            That they the stranger might impress
                            By simply doing as they ought.
                        
                        
                            But parents know to no avail
                            Shall they command, entreat or scoff--
                            Each guest's arrival turns them pale,
                            And starts their offspring "showing off."
                        
                        
                            They're well behaved when all alone,
                            But act like porkers at their trough,
                            Or dogs that fight about a bone,
                            When thus for company " showing off."
                        
                        
                            Though we continue to the grave
                            Still "showing off," we fondly pray
                            We learn appearances to save,
                            And do it in a wiser way.
                        
                        
                        
                            But this we know, that ever more
                            This bitter cup our lips shall quaff,
                            That every stranger at our door
                            Shall find the children " showing off! "
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AN UNLUCKY DAY
                        
                            I FELT so bad all yesterday,
                            And had the most unlucky time:
                            My pet canary got away;
                            I lost my only silver dime.
                        
                        
                            I let my china dishes fall,
                            And fell myself and bumped my head,
                            And broke the nose off my new doll--
                            I almost wished that I was dead!
                        
                        
                            My papa didn't care at all,
                            But just pretended to, and says
                            That when I've grown up twice as tall,
                            I'll know what trouble is, he guess.
                        
                        
                            Told how the "fly" et all his wheat,
                            And how the drouth cut short his corn,
                            And costs so much to dress and eat
                            That he wish he was never born!
                        
                        
                            And when at last I went to bed,
                            I couldn't go to sleep, but cried--
                            I had a sore spot on my head,
                            But it was sorer yet inside!
                        
                        
                            Then, all at once, a little star
                            Winked at the moon and said, " What fools
                            These grown-up human beings are,
                            For all their learning and their schools

                            Say in a thousand years from now,
                            Won't look so large, I'm here to state,
                            Or so important, anyhow.
                        
                        
                            "Or, let 'em come up here with us,
                            Some million miles up in the sky,
                            The woes that made them fume and fuss
                            Would look too small for naked eye!"
                        
                        
                            And then the moon smiled down on me, 
                            And said that human griefs and joys
                            Are relative in size, you see,
                            The same for grown folks and for boys.
                        
                        
                            Next morning, when the round, red sun
                            Peeped on my bed, it seemed to say:
                            "This time I'll bring you loads of fun,
                            For this will be a brand new day!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE DISOBLIGING CLOCK
                        
                            WHY is it, when I've earache, in the
                                midde of the 
                            night,

                                try
                            with all my might,
                            when I lay in bed an listen to the ticking of the
                            clock,
                            That it seems to wait a minute between the
                            "tick" an'
                                "tock?"
                        
                        
                            But when my playmates visit, an' can only stay
                            an hour,
                            That clock ac's so provokin' 'at it makes
                                us awful
                            sour,
                            For it tumbles out the seconds an' the minutes in a
                            flock,
                            So you scarcely hear it tickin' an' it never
                                stops
                            to "tock!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A DEEP REVENGE
                        
                            TO-DAY the teacher of our school,
                            Just 'cause I broke some little rule,
                            Made me, stand on the schoolhouse floor--.
                            So I don't like him any more!
                        
                        
                            'N' I have just made up my mind,
                            Because he treats rue s unkind,
                            'At just to he revenged on him
                            I'm goin' to climb Fame's highest
                                limb.
                        
                        
                            I guess 'at when he's old an' bent,
                            An' I'm elected President,
                            'At he'll feel sorry more an' more

                            I guess 'at when he's old an' poor,
                            Like teachers always get for sure,
                            An' I'm a proud old millionaire,
                            He'll wish't he'd treated me more
                                fair.
                        
                        
                            Er mebbe I'll write famous books,
                            Like where Nick Carter hauls in crooks;
                            An' I'd just snub him, then, an' laff
                            Ef he should ast my autograff.
                        
                        
                            Er I just wish't there'd be a war,
                            So I could be a commydore
                            Er general--an' then I know
                            He'd wish't he'd never used me so.
                        
                        
                        
                            Er better yet, I'd like to be
                            A pirate captain on the sea,
                            An' then he'd haf to stay on land
                            Er else be captured by our hand.
                        
                        
                            I'll bet that when my teacher's old
                            An' I am great, I'll ac' so cold,
                            He'll kick himself until he's sore
                            Fer makin' me stand on the floor.
                        
                        
                            Course now he only laffs at me
                            When I look mad as mad kin be--
                            
                                But when I'm big, I'll have his
                                    gore,
                            
                            
                                Fer makin' me stand on the floor!
                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE RUBAIYAT OF THAT DOG JIGGER
                        
                            THERE are dogs whose bark is louder,
                            None can show more vim and vigor--
                            To compare them makes us prouder;
                            So we sing in praise of Jigger!
                        
                        
                            There are dogs whose gait is faster,
                            But they could not be more eager--
                            And he sticks like porous plaster;
                            So we sing in praise of Jigger!
                        
                        
                            Some dogs' pedigrees are brighter,
                            But that doesn't cut no figger--
                            Couldn't any dog act
                                whiter;
                            So we sing in praise of Jigger!
                        
                        
                            Some dogs' sense of smell is stronger--
                            He's unrivalled as a digger--
                            None can keep a-goin' longer;
                            So we sing in praise of Jigger!
                        
                        
                            Mebbe there are dogs that's smarter--
                            There are many that are bigger--
                            But not one for him we'd barter;
                            So we sing in praise of Jigger!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A JUVENILE FLIRTATION
                        
                            THEIR homes lay near, and face to face;
                            Between them ran the highway straight--
                            'Twas here that this romance took place--
                            And She was seven and He was eight.
                        
                        
                            It was each parent's stern command
                            That neither should that highway cross--
                            And this is why, you understand,
                            That Love's sweet self was at a loss.
                        
                        
                            He went to his front yard to play,
                            And shot his arrows 'round with skill;
                            She sat and looked the other way;
                            He whistled--but she sat there still.
                        
                        
                            Then he produced his Noah's Ark,
                            And scattered out its wolves and bears--
                            She did not gaze, she did not mark,
                            But 'tended to her own affairs.
                        
                        
                            Then brought he forth his red wheeled cart,
                            And hauled a load of sand or two--
                            In vain--the charmer sat apart,
                            He saw with grief it would not do.
                        
                        
                            Then did he seek a ripe, red peach,
                            A yellow pear and purple plum,
                            And placed them in convenient reach --
                            She rocked her doll, and did not come.
                        
                        
                        
                            At this he turned his back in wrath,
                            And blew his nose, and wiped his eyes--
                            She sauntered out the beaten path,
                            And started in to make mud pies.
                        
                        
                            She shook her muslin bonnet off,
                            Thus setting free her golden curls,
                            And, though his anger makes him cough--
                            A fellow can't stay mad with girls.
                        
                        
                            Again the Noah's Ark appears--
                            Alas for parent's stern decree,
                            The stormy sky in radiance clears,
                            And he forgets and so does she.
                        
                        
                            Till, for perhaps the thousandth time,
                            A parent with a cruel heart
                            Shall find them, black with dust and grime,
                            And tear their blighted souls apart.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HICK'RY BANTER
                        
                            IN our early days at school,
                            Nothing could so well suffice
                            To fill our cup of pleasure full
                            As "hickr'ry banter" on thin ice.
                        
                        
                            One of us would skate across,
                            Then another, though we knew,
                            As the ice would crack and toss,
                            That we'd very soon break through.
                        
                        
                            And we'd feel a heartfelt joy,
                            And a happiness complete,
                            When at last some luckless boy
                            Would break through and wet his feet.
                        
                        
                            We play "hick'ry banter" still
                            After power, success or wealth,
                            Driving with a heedless will
                            Over conscience, right and health.
                        
                        
                            Yea, and when a comrade fails,
                            Still our sympathy is brief;
                            Secretly his neighbor rails
                            At his failure and his grief.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A PUZZLING QUESTION
                        
                            I HAD a fight, the other day,
                            And whipped my seatmate, Dora Gray,
                            And scratched her face and tore her dress
                            Now she'll behave herself, I guess--
                            I only showed her who was boss,
                            So why should Teacher act so cross?
                        
                        
                            And once, when I was playin' ball,
                            A-bouncin' it against the wall,
                            It hit upon the window sash
                            And broke a pane of glass, k-smash!
                            I gave it such a little toss,
                            So why should Teacher act so cross?
                        
                        
                            One day I took my darkey doll
                            (I didn't mean to let it fall)--
                            I'd printed Teacher's name on it,
                            And, sir, I thought he'd take a fit--
                            Across its back I'd pasted moss,
                            But why should that make Teacher cross?
                        
                        
                            I get mixed up in 'Rithmetic,
                            Till it 'most makes my teacher sick;
                            I twist up dollars, pounds and quarts
                            Until he gets all out of sorts--
                            I told him twenty was a gross,
                            But why should that make Teacher cross?
                        
                        
                            One day I found a fotygraff
                            In Teacher's desk--I have to laff--
                            
                            It was his girl, and looked so sweet,
                            She just looked good enough to eat--
                            That surely wasn't no great loss,
                            So why should Teacher act so cross?
                        
                        
                            My little brother, Ross, and I
                            My mamma says are 'nough to try
                            The patience of a martered saint--
                            Sometimes we almost make her faint--
                            If kids are all like me and Ross,
                            She says, no wonder Teacher's cross.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        LEATHER BOOTS
                        
                            I STILL recall a distant past,
                            When we plucked knowledge by the roots;
                            In those days things were made to last,
                            And boys like me wore leather boots.
                        
                        
                            True, their appearance was not neat;
                            They always made appalling noise,
                            And they were torture to the feet,
                            But thought quite good enough for boys.
                        
                        
                            If to our elders we'd complain
                            'Twas evident our cause was lost,
                            For we forthwith would ascertain
                            That they went barfoot in the
                                frost!
                        
                        
                            The shoe man measured off our feet,
                            And then got busy in his shop,
                            And turned those boots out, all complete,
                            With iron toe and gorgeous top.
                        
                        
                            They were a treasure, too, at first,
                            They felt so soft and new and nice--
                            The softness left them when immersed
                            In soaking water once or twice.
                        
                        
                            Thenceforth to get them on we'd groan
                            And puff and pull and sweat and cough,
                            Yet this was nothing, I must own,
                            To what it meant to get them off!
                        
                        
                        
                            We rubbed them, then, with boiling grease;
                            In vain our tender hands we'd burn;
                            Alas! that comfortable peace
                            To our young feet would ne'er return!
                        
                        
                            Yet when my children come to me
                            For footwear several times each year,
                            I mourn that such a change must be,
                            And hold those boots in memory dear.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        MAMMA'S "VISIT"
                        
                            I wish't my mamma'd come back
                                home'n' stay,
                            Seems like a year that she's been gone away.
                            She went "Ljut for a visit," so she said,
                            But looked as though she'd 'bout as soon be
                                dead.
                        
                        
                            I don't see why she had to cry an' cry,
                            When she kissed me an' Babe an' Tim good-bye,
                            An' say, "Poor little tads," an'
                                cry some more,
                            Until her eyes were all swelled up 'n' sore.
                        
                        
                            Ner I don't see why papa feels so bad
                            When it's the longest visit mamma's had
                            Since I remember--fer I'm sure I know
                            If I'd a chance that I'd be glad to go.
                        
                        
                            But Tim saw mamma yesterday, an' said
                            She looked all pale an' sick an' was in bed,
                            An' lots of people was, an' they
                                were white,
                            Like people get when they're not feelin' right.
                        
                        
                            An' girls with little white caps on their heads
                            Were waitin' on the sick folks in the beds,
                            A-bringin' things t' eat, on little trays,
                            An' scootin'', quiet-like, just
                                everyways.
                        
                        
                            Then everywhere was such a funny smell--
                            Tim said would make you sick if you were well--
                            Just like the stuff that papa used to keep,
                            He said, to "put sooperflewus cats to sleep."
                        
                        
                        
                            Next time, I guess that it's my turn to go
                            An' visit mamma, for I want her so,
                            An' Mrs. Smith's a-goin', for she sent
                            Me word she'd take me with her when she went.
                        
                        
                            Then she cried too, an' said she felt so bad
                            About the "opperashun " mamma had--
                            I wonder what she meant--I wonder, is it
                            A word the grown folks use that means a visit?
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AN ACCOMMODATING CONSCIENCE
                        
                            I WONDER why it is that when I lay awake at
                                night
                            I think when daylight comes again, I'll always do
                            what's right;
                            My conscience stings me for my sins, as long as it
                            is dark--
                            When daylight comes, it sorto' grins, and goes off
                            on a lark.
                        
                        
                            I think the grown folks consciences act 'bout the
                            same as mine,
                            And seldom bother them, I guess, when things are
                            goin' fine;
                            But soon as trouble comes--like night--you'll
                            find that they repent,
                            And then when things are going' right, their con-
                            sciences relent.
                        
                        
                            Perhaps that's what the daylight's fer--perhaps
                            God's wisdom guessed
                            At night our consciences would stir, and then
                            they'd need a rest--
                            If He'd a-wanted boys like me to always do
                                what's
                            right,
                            He'd left the daylight out, you see, and made it
                            always night.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE AUTBIOGRAPHY OF A COPPER CENT
                        
                            I'M just a little copper cent,
                            And hard to get and easy spent,
                            And I was made long years ago
                            By Uncle Sam himself, you know.
                        
                        
                            At first I was as bright as gold--
                            You'd never think it, now I'm old;
                            The children hailed we with delight
                            Because I was so new and bright.
                        
                        
                            I've travelled long and far since then,
                            Among the queerest sorts of men,
                            So it's no wonder that I know
                            As much again as people do.
                        
                        
                            When first I left the busy Mint,
                            I'd neither tarnish, flaw nor dint--
                            I do not mention this to boast,
                            Since now I'm but a wreck, at most.
                        
                        
                            I first was hailed with noisy joy
                            To swell the treasure of a boy,
                            Then travelled to a candy store,
                            And never saw that boy more.
                        
                        
                            Next day I went to Sunday School,
                            Where pennies seemed to be the rule--
                            You never saw such affluence
                            Of every kind of copper cents!
                        
                        
                        
                            I made two other visits soon,
                            And then I went to a saloon--
                            I didn't like its moral sir,
                            But there was lots of money there.
                        
                        
                            Next day I lfet that godless camp
                            In the vest pocket of a tramp,
                            For just a day or two, and then
                            Went back to a saloon again.
                        
                        
                            About this time, as you'll suspect,
                            I needed a good "disinfect"--
                            I travelled north, I travelled south--
                            Oh, never put me in your mouth!
                        
                        
                            And then I struck a miser's lair,
                            And almost gasped to get fresh air;
                            He squeezed me till, in course of time,
                            I thought perhaps I was a dime.
                        
                        
                            He died--and left me to a man
                            Constructed on another plan,
                            Who lightly said, "It's just a cent,"
                            Nor cared how soon or far I went.
                        
                        
                            Next day I started out again,
                            The servant of all sorts of men;
                            I'd leave a pocket all but bare
                            And land upon a millionaire.
                        
                        
                        
                            I went by wagon--went by train--
                            On foot--in ships that sail the main--
                            And once they lost me in the dust
                            Till I was covered with green rust.
                        
                        
                            I have belonged to some young men--
                            I pray I never may again;
                            With copper cents their purse was lined,
                            They never had the other
                                kind!
                        
                        
                            I've bought enough of cheap cigars,
                            I guess, to load a train of cars,
                            And glided down some slot machine
                            Till just the memory turns me green.
                        
                        
                            While as for candy and for gum,
                            I surely have been "'going some"
                            And monthly, as a general rule, 
                            You'd find me at some Sunday School.
                        
                        
                            And yet, for all the years I've passed,
                            I'm not respected much at last,
                            For copper, even when it's old,
                            Is never honored as is gold.
                        
                        
                            So I've been snubbed uncounted times
                            By all the nickels and the dimes,
                            And once--but that was years ago--
                            Even a three-cent-piece acted so!
                        
                        
                        
                            While as for gold and paper cash,
                            They simply looked on me as trash,
                            Although Ben Franklin used to say
                            I should be honored more than they.
                        
                        
                            A boy took me once, alack!
                            And laid me on a railroad track,
                            And I assure you that since that
                            I've ever since felt crushed and flat!
                        
                        
                            And then--it pierced me to the soul--
                            Right through my rim he bored a HOLE!
                            Then put a ribbon through, by Heck,
                            And hung me on his sweetheart's neck!
                        
                        
                            I've been worth nothing ever since--
                            Sometimes it almost makes me wince;
                            So now I've slipped away and hid
                            Among the playthings of a kid.
                        
                        
                            So I am just a copper cent,
                            All rusted, battered up and bent;
                            And with this moral I will end:
                            I'm hard to
                                GET, but not to
                                SPEND!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WASTED EFFORT
                        
                            I'VE figured till I'm
                                goin' t' quit--
                            I don't like 'Rithmatic a bit,
                            Ner I can't see th' use of it--
                            I'll tell you why:
                            I've noticed business folks to-day
                            Have thrown their 'rithmetics away,
                            So most of what the teachers say
                            Is all a lie!
                        
                        
                            F'r instance, I can work an hour,
                            Until I'm mad 'n' cross
                                'n' sour,
                            On how much bran 'n' how much flour
                            A man should get
                            F'r certain given pounds of wheat,
                            But at th' mill they work it neat--
                            Some " doo-dad " figures it complete
                            F'r them, you bet!
                        
                        
                            'N' when our grocer makes his sales
                            He throws things on compting scales,
                            Like we toss pennies--"heads er tails "--
                            'N' quick as
                                "scat,"
                            Writes th' amount, you bet your neck,
                            Where we'd write figures by th' peck--
                            Then get th' answer wrong, by Heck,
                            I'll bet my hat!
                        
                        
                            'N' t'other day I went with pa
                            T' get a load of coal f'r ma,
                            
                            'N' then I kindo' thought I saw
                            Some chance f'r fun--
                            W'at that coal cost--'twuz no mere song--
                            I'd had t' figure, loud
                                'n' long-
                            Then, more'n likely, got it wrong,
                            When I was done.
                        
                        
                            Yep, I'd a-covered half my slate,
                            'N' made mistakes, as sure as Fate--
                            Th' coal man said, "six ninety-eight,"
                            'N' that was all--
                            It was s' easy, bless y'r heart,
                            I know my jaws jus' fell apart--
                            He simply squinted at a chart
                            Hung on th' wall!
                        
                        
                            I helped pa pay same interest due--
                            I hate those "interest problems," too;
                            Thought I, old man, it's up t' you
                            T' figure some"--
                            It seemed a mixed up mess t' me--
                            Th' banker said, "six eighty-three,"
                            Quick as a wink,--w'y Jeminee,
                            It struck me dumb!
                        
                        
                            Pa says they've got machines t'
                                add--
                            I haven't one, but wish I had,
                            F'r addin' makes me tired 'n'
                                mad,
                            'N' gives me aches--
                            They'll get machines--it makes me
                                sick--
                            I wish 'at they'd invent 'em quick--
                            To work th' whole blame 'Rithmetic
                            Without mistakes!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        FATHER'S POST GRADUATE COURSE
                        
                            IN boyhood days, as you, I trust,
                            With due contrition will recall,
                            You studied only when you must--
                            A case of "groundhog," that was all!
                            The teacher might be cross and glum,
                            Or coax or wheedle, scold or tease,
                            And call you lazy, call you dumb--
                            You heeded not such things as these!
                        
                        
                            But now when schooldays long are past,
                            You're punished for that laziness--
                            And Nemesis strikes you at last;
                            You've got to study now, I guess!
                            For, as you read your evening news,
                            Your children pile upon your lap
                            With a demand you can't refuse--
                            "Please help me with my problems, Pap."
                        
                        
                            You slyly con forgotten rules,
                            And some, perhaps, you never knew--
                            And speak about the splendid schools
                            That poured the knowledge into you.
                            You swear--aside--as there you sit--
                            No chance to dodge, evade or shirk;
                            You'd rather die than to admit
                            There's anything you cannot work!
                        
                        
                        
                            Each child repeats the process o'er--
                            It is, in truth, a dreadful fate--
                            But at the age of, say, two score,
                            You're really fit to graduate!
                            The labor brings its due reward--
                            Unceasing toil has turned the trick,
                            And you--for whcih you thank the Lord--
                            Can work the whole Arithmetic!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE GOBBLER'S OPINION OF THANKSGIVING
                        
                            THIS must be what the human folks call their
                            Thanksgiving Day,
                            And they enjoy it lots, I guess, from what I hear
                            them say;
                            But when I think how turkey deaths have hap-
                            pened by the score,
                            I wonder what us turkeys have to be so thankful
                            for.
                        
                        
                            I had a splendid family once--their numbers now
                            are few-- 
                            They all died an untimely death, excepting one or
                            two;
                            I'd half a hundred children once or maybe even
                            more;
                            What can this childless turkey have to be so thank-
                            ful for?
                        
                        
                            I saw my very finest son beheaded yesterday,
                            And I feel sure it was his bones the cook just threw
                            away--
                            Such sights as these I'm sure would make 'most
                                any
                            parent sore,
                            So tell me what us turkeys have to be so thankful
                            for.
                        
                        
                        
                            I might be thankful I'm alive, had I not heard them
                            say,
                            "Well save the gobbler, there, to eat for dinner
                            Christmas Day";
                            I ask you, with an end like that immutably in store,
                            What can a poor doomed Gobbler have to be so
                            thankful for?
                        
                    
                    
                    
                         A VEXATIOUS FATHER
                        
                            MA says that Father leaves his clothes, as
                                locusts
                            do their shells,
                            Just scattered everywhere be goes, in spite of all
                            she tells,
                            And that it drives her most insane, when things
                            are tidied quite,
                            He comes through like a hurricane and they are
                            left a "fright."
                        
                        
                            She says that when she goes away and Father's
                            left to cook,
                            Her kitchen, somehow, will display a sort of
                            stormy look,
                            And its disorder will increase till every pot and pan
                            Is scattered 'round, all daubed with
                                grease--ain't
                            that just like a man!
                        
                        
                            Ma's patience gets almighty slim when Father
                            sweeps the floor--
                            She knows that she could follow him and get a
                            bushel more;
                            And even then, she says, she'll find--it drives her
                            to despair--
                            What dust he hasn't left behind is scattered in
                            the air.
                        
                        
                            She says she doesn't want to vote--her time is
                            all employed,
                            Or home would be, as Moses wrote, "without form
                            and void";
                            
                            In fact, it troubles all of us to keep our Christian
                            grace
                            With Father constituted thus, and litt'ring up the 
                            place.
                        
                        
                            Still, Father gives us all a love that's boundless,
                            deep and wide--
                            Ours needs assistance from Above, the way
                                it's
                            often tried;
                            But Ma, though Father's faults are tall, forgives
                            them on the plea,
                            His heart, at least, keeps after all right where it
                            ought to be.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE ADVENTURES OF BUNNY COTTONTAIL
                        
                            THERE he hides beneath a rail--
                            Long of ear and short of tail--
                            Sheltered from the wintry gale.
                        
                        
                            A cruel hunter's on his trail,
                            And yet his spirit doth not quail--
                            Heroic Bunny Cottontail!
                        
                        
                            Straight to a log we see him sail,
                            A ferret follows, tooth and nail--
                            What now shall hollow logs avail?
                        
                        
                            Now over meadow--over dale--
                            We follow still the tireless trail
                            of little Bunny Cottontail.
                        
                        
                            Would that he bad a coat of mail,
                            Or might some friendly tree-trunk scale,
                            Or fly like birds that breast the gale.
                        
                        
                            Alas for Bunny.Cottontail!
                            His hope for life grows weak and stale,
                            At last he trembles and turns pale.
                        
                        
                            He seeks a brushpile's shelter frail,
                            His dauntless heart begins to fail,
                            And mournful thoughts his soul assail.
                        
                        
                        
                            He's driven forth'mid shots like hail--
                            Can speed or cunning now avail
                            Our hero, Bunny Cottontail?
                        
                        
                            The time has come to draw the veil--
                            Weep, my children, weep and wail--
                            End of Bunny Cottontail!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A HARROWING EXPERIENCE
                        
                            WUNST I found a hornet's nest--
                            Had a grouch--
                            Was forbidden to molest;
                            Said I'd do as I thought best;
                            Heaved a club right through the pest,--
                            Hollered " Ouch!"
                        
                        
                            Comes t' movin' on my feet,
                            I'm no slouch--
                            Planned t' hit 'em one 'n'
                                beat,
                            Y' might say, a quick retreat;
                            Hornets beat me every beat,--
                            Hollered "Ouch! "
                        
                        
                            Thought at first that I'd been shot, 
                            'Menced t' crouch--
                            Might as well been, like as not;
                            Gee! The atmosphere seemed hot;
                            All the comfort that I got,
                            Hollered "Ouch! "
                        
                        
                            Went home later, with a face
                            Like a pouch--
                            Father stopped in midst of "grace,"
                            Went and got a harness trace--
                            Nothin' seems to fit the case,--
                            Only "Ouch!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        PARENTAL INCONSISTENCY
                        
                            THE other day, out in our barn,
                            When Pa was milkin' our ol' cow,
                            She kicked, and papa he said, "DARN!"
                            An' wasn't that jus' awful, now?
                        
                        
                            He's apt t' say 'most anything
                            When he don't know that we're around,
                            An' ol' hen flops him with her wing
                            Er scratches up his garden ground.
                        
                        
                            But then he'll go an' lecture us
                            'Bout ever sayin' words'at's
                                bad,
                            A'n' tell us, with an awful fuss,
                            He never did when he's a lad.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A DISAPPOINTING SHOW
                        
                            MY papa told me once, if I would hoe
                            His garden patch, 'n' weed it, every row,
                            'At purty soon he'd take me to a
                                "Show."
                        
                        
                            I went to Ringlin' Brothers' Circus once,
                            'N' saw the camels an' the elefunts,
                            'At dance 'n' do all sorts of funny
                                stunts.
                        
                        
                            I s'posed of course he meant a show like that,
                            With tigers, tamer 'n' our ol' tabby
                                cat,
                            'N' clowns with pointy face 'n'
                                pointy hat.
                        
                        
                            'N' so I hoed 'n' hoed,
                                'n' sweat 'n' sweat,

                            Then after I had finished ev'ry row,
                            W'y, papa, said t' hurry 'n'
                                we'd go

                                Show.
                        
                        
                            I read one time 'at "man was made t'

                            It's so, I guess, f'r sure as you were born
                            The only " Show " I saw was ears of
                                    corn!
                        
                        
                            'Bout that time I tell you 'at I felt blue,
                            'N' mad 'n' cross

                            It was a Corn Show 'at he took me to!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A RETROSPECT
                        
                            WHEN you were eight and I was nine
                            Life loomed before us fair and fine,
                            And earth in pristine beauty shone,
                            Without a blemish or a flaw;
                            But how we wished that we were grown,
                            And freed from the parental law--
                            For I was yours and you were mine,
                            When you were eight and I was nine.
                        
                        
                            When you were eight and I was nine,
                            The " stump " was circled by the
                                "Lvine"--
                            Struck by the arrows Cupid aims,
                            We planned to marry, by and by;
                            Perhaps we did not mention names,
                            But--you knew whom, and so did I--
                            For I was yours and you were mine,
                            When you were eight and I was nine.
                        
                        
                            When you were eight and I was nine,
                            The future gleamed with light divine--
                            But that was years and years ago;
                            Love never last its old time charms,
                            And so the lve-god ith hisbow
                            Has placed life partners in our arms,
                            But . . . you have yours and I have mine,
                            At fifty-eight and fifty-nine!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AN OBLIGING FATHER
                        
                            WHENEVER circuses come near--
                            Which generally is twice a year--
                            You'll always find one happy pair:
                            My pa and I are always there.
                        
                        
                            Pa always tells folks that of course
                            You couldn't drag him there by force;
                            There's nothin' there be cares t' see,
                            He has t' go along with me.
                        
                        
                            But I have noticed pa will laugh
                            At all the doin's more by half
                            And seems t' like 'em more than I,
                            'N' so I've always wondered why.
                        
                        
                            'N' I believe, when I am grown
                            So I can go to shows alone,
                            Pa'll hunt a boy to adopt,
                            Before he'll have his circus stopped.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        NICKNAMES
                        
                            You have noticed how fond parents will worry
                            and debate
                            On the naming of their offspring as a matter of
                            much weight,
                            And, after due discussion, they will settle on a
                            name
                            That might well be immortal, on the Rolls of
                            deathless Fame--
                            A name replete with dignity, euphonious in sound,
                            In short, a name that seems to say, " I most grow
                            world renowned!"
                        
                        
                            Alas! The cruel world, in scorn, will likely ast
                            aside,
                            Or twist, deform and mutilate that cognomen of
                            pride;
                            Thus, Raymond Rudolph Thompson, if his young
                            form be thin,
                            Will be known at school as " Skinny," shortened
                            later on to " Skin";
                            Or if, perchance, an auburn thatch surmount his
                            youthful head,
                            He'll be christened "'Redhead
                                Thompson," or, in
                            common parlance, "Red."
                        
                        
                            The roster of my school days is with such nick-
                            names filed,
                            Now long unused and oftentimes their bearers'
                            voices stilled;
                            
                            Some names showed boyish irony--the slowest boy
                            called "Swift,"
                            While " Deacon" Jones had wide renown as one
                            of sinful drift.
                            One youth we christened "Satan" Smith--bad
                            past all mortal hope--
                            While one long-legged, lanky lad we surnamed
                            " Antelope."
                        
                        
                            Our nicknames were not always kind; for instance,
                            is it meet
                            To give a maiden such a name as "Anna Mary
                            Pete"?
                            And names like " Fat " and " Buck
                                " and " Skin,"
                            whatever their intent,
                            Would scarce to an outsider's ear convey a com-
                            pliment!
                            And I fear a lack of due respect we may have also
                            showed,
                            To give a child whoseT name was Hopp the soubri-
                            quet, " Hoptoad! "
                        
                        
                            The world gives nicknames to us still, as on our
                            way we trudge;
                            As, for example, Satan Smith--today they call
                            him Judge;
                            "Fat " Henry's called a "
                                financier," while as for
                            "Deacon" Jones,
                            He's nicknamed " seven sixty one," and
                                works at
                            breaking stones--
                            
                            While "Antelope"--I have to laugh--he's
                                now
                            an LL.D.,
                            And almost all the alphabet--from A.B. clear
                            to Z.
                        
                        
                            Folks used to say "Pudd" Williams was the
                            dumbest of the lot,
                            And, far as I could ever see, were right, as like
                                as
                            not!
                            But sir! He went to Europe and studied music
                            there,
                            And came back looking foreign-like, and with a
                            mop of hair,
                            And people flock to hear him play, and pay an
                            awful price;
                            They call him "Signor Guillemo"--I've been
                                to
                            hear him twice!
                        
                        
                            But as the nicknames of our youth have long since
                            passed away,
                            So shall the ones we're wearing now, when dignified
                            and gray;
                            Nor matters it beneath what names our inner
                            selves may hide,--
                            They are,in truth, but outer shells, whose kernel
                            lies inside;
                            For words, unless they stand for deeds, are breaths
                            of idle air;
                            May what our nicknames symbolize be pure and
                            true and fair!

                            School;
                            You'll find it interestin' and instructive, as a
                                rule;
                            Our members have such talent--not a one's a
                            common scrub--
                            So you shouldn't miss a meeting of the "Webster

                            We've argued "whether Church or School does
                            greatest good to men?"
                            And the respective merits of the "sword" and of
                            the "pen";
                            We've proved and settled that the "end"
                                can't
                            justify the " means,"
                            And Q.E.D.'d that Uncle Sam should sell the

                            In fact, 'most ev'ry question that commences
                                with

                            future solved;
                            But this unanswered problem is eternally on hand,
                            "Whether Washington or Lincoln was most useful
                            to the land?"
                        
                        
                            Tom Smith is the debater who is hardest to
                            refute--

                            Whether Washington or Lincoln was the greatest

                            But we've all learned a lot of things we never used

                            In defiance--"No, I'm
                                    tissent!"
                        
                        
                            More grammatically today,

                            When your duty calls for "nay"

                        YE VALIANT KNIGHTE AND YE GRACE- LESSE PAGE
                        
                            Sir Bum de Bum, in armor,
                            Returneth from the war,
                            Where he hath gathered honor
                            In many a combat sore.
                        
                        
                            Behind him rideth lightly
                            His young and graceless page,
                            Whose shameless pranks hath often
                            His master filled with rage.
                        
                        
                            Sir Bum feared never Paynim
                            Or Saracen, forsooth!
                            So much as the designings
                            Of this irrev'rent youth.
                        
                        
                            His armor may protect him
                            From hostile foeman's shaft--
                            Not from the jests so ribald,
                            Whereat the page hath laughed.
                        
                        
                            Once, whilst Sir Bum wast swiming,
                            Nor fearing ill, perchance,
                            Ye page slipped up behind him
                             And stole his iron pants!
                        
                        
                            Again, as he wast dreaming
                            of tournaments he'd win,
                            Ye page didst ope his armor
                            And slipped a hornet in.
                        
                        
                        
                            Sir Bum once went to battle
                            With all his knightly troop,
                            Upon his back this legend:
                            " USE BEATEM'S OXTAIL SOUP!"
                        
                        
                            Once, at the hour of midnight,
                            Rose long and loud alarms;
                            A Voice came through the darkness
                            "Sir Bum, yield up your arms! "
                        
                        
                            Sir Bum rode forth for battle
                            With haughty air, I trow,--
                            Ye page, with wooden weapons,
                            Was mounted on a cow!
                        
                        
                            Once, as Sir Bum walked idly
                            Beside his castle moat,
                            Ye page didst loose behind him
                            A fierce and warlike goat.
                        
                        
                            As though by lance sent flying,
                            Sir Bum went on his head--
                            Stunned by the heavy armor,
                            The goat, alack, was dead.
                        
                        
                            The moral of this ballad,
                            If moral it may claim:
                            Boys, through the changing ages,
                            Have ever been the same.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE GREAT OBJECTION
                        
                            I LIKE to hear big sister, when she sits

                        THE HAWKS NEST
                        
                            I'LL, tell you 'bout the
                                hawk's nest at, las' Sunday
                            afternoon,
                            We run acrost in Grimes's woods, and climbed fer
                            like a coon;
                            Chum found it in a big ash tree--no limb fer
                            forty feet--
                            Bantered me t' climb it, an' I hated t' be
                                beat.
                        
                        
                            He's been c'lectin' birds' eggs

                            a while--
                            C'menced with hen eggs, I suppose, t' end with
                            crocodile;
                            He says that kind o' hawks 'r' scarce, so
                                suit him t'
                            perfection
                            T' rob it of its eggs, y' know, t' add
                                t' his c'lec
                            tion.
                        
                        
                            There's some folks argue, off 'n' on, how
                                it's a sin t'
                            steal
                            Eggs fr'm th' harmless little birds, until
                                we'd
                            mebbe feel
                            Repentant f'r an hour er so, but the next new kind
                            of nest
                            We'd run acrost'was sure t' lose its
                                contents like
                            the rest.
                        
                        
                            Besides, since hawks 'r' birds of prey
                                'n' chicken
                            thieves, you'd own
                            That it'd almost be a sin t' leave their nests alone!
                            
                            'N' so I started up th' tree,
                                a-knowin' all th' time
                            It was a lot too big 'n' tall f'r me
                                t' try t' climb.
                        
                        
                            I'd shin up till my wind give out, then hang
                                'n' rest
                            awhile,
                            'N' I declare, th' last ten feet appeared

                            Arms 'n' legs was all s' tired that I
                                could hardly
                            crawl,
                            And yet I doesn't start back down, f'r fear that

                            'u'd fall.
                        
                        
                            So I kep' goin' towards th' top--but slow,

                            'N' jus' hung on an' rested there
                                f'r mighty near
                            an hour.
                        
                        
                            Th' rest, of course, looked easy, but I soon began
                            t' know
                            That nest was four times higher'n it looked
                                fr'm
                            down below;
                            So I began t' climb again, not lookin' at
                                th'
                            ground,
                            But holdin' with a tighter grip, 'n'
                                scared at ev'ry
                            sound.
                        
                        
                        
                            Would hae backed out yet, I reckon, but my chum
                            set on a stump
                            'N' jus' kep' on
                                a-hollerin', "Go on, you timid
                            chump!"
                            Y' see, he's 'most afraid t'
                                climb a little apple
                            tree,
                            But mighty bold, down on th' ground, t' holler
                            things at me!
                        
                        
                            So I kep' on fr'm limb t' limb, afraid
                                t' stop 'n'
                            rest,
                            Until I got jus' underneath that brushpile of a
                            nest,
                            'N' when I started t' look in, all tired,
                                scared 'n'
                            scratched,
                            I heard a "cheepp"--'n'
                                purt' near fell--those
                            doggoned eggs had hatched!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE PIG IN THE PARLOR
                        
                            WHEN invited to a "party," as a very little
                                boy,
                            You remember how it thrilled you with terror
                            and with joy,
                            With what vast anticipation your clothes and shoes
                            were brushed;
                            Wben at last you entered primly, with your daunt-
                            less spirit crushed,
                            You observed your school-day comrades, with an
                            unfamiliar air
                            Of propriety, around you in straight rows were
                            sitting there.
                            Then a diffculty met you, you could never under-
                            stand,
                            For you hadn't the least idea what to do with either
                            hand,
                            And then, a moment later, your confusion to com-
                            plete,
                            You were similarly troubled as to where to put
                            your feet--
                            Oh, you hadn't the least idea what to say or what
                            to do,
                            Till you "kept the pig in the parlor and it was
                            Irish too!"
                        
                        
                            Oh, that game was your salvation--you had felt
                            your face grow red,
                            And you knew the need of rescue or you'd very
                            soon be dead,
                            But by "the pig in the parlor" your spirits
                                soon
                            were thawed,
                            
                            And mustering your courage, at last you stirred
                            abroad.
                            At first you did not join the game, but sought a
                            safe retreat
                            Where you might stow away your hands and for-
                            get about your feet,
                            And watch that ring of awkward boys and most
                            entrancing girls--
                            These last, perfection from their feet to their
                            beribboned curls;
                            And as the blessed game went on, it made your
                            heart rejoice
                            To find, by valiant effort, you were getting back
                            your voice.
                            By and by, on invitations that were freely given
                            you,
                            You "kept the pig in the parlor and it was Irish
                            too!"
                        
                        
                            You have doubtless been embarrassed by some
                            "social functions" since,
                            And your lack of easy manners made your troubled
                            spirit wince,
                            But never ball or banquet shall give you such
                            affright
                            Or such a terror as came o'er you on that memora-
                            ble night.
                            Some social situations may make you ill at ease,
                            But though your spirits may be chilled they never
                            more shall freeze;
                            What though your later errors may make you feel
                            a dunce,
                            
                            Still the spirit, like the body, can only die but
                            once.
                            And I ween, at later banquets, where society is
                            thronged,
                            Full of formal affectations--and eternally pro-
                            longed--
                            You will long to see them ended, and you'll give
                            the days their due
                            When "you kept the pig in the parlor and it was
                            Irish too!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SECRETS
                        I'VE got the biggest secret, that
                            I'm never goin'
                        to tell:
                        It started out with Mary, who told it all to Belle,
                        Then she told it to Nora, who passed it on to
                        Fan;
                        Fan let it out to Susy, who told it all to Anne;
                        She whispered it to Bertha, who went and told a
                        boy,
                        And course he couldn't keep it and so it got to
                        Roy;
                        He told his brother Willie; from there it got to
                        Tom -
                        It's a really, truly secret, for
                            that's who I got it
                        from.
                        And, 'course, 'cause it's a secret,
                            I'm never goin' to
                        tell
                        A soul except my sisters and my chum and seat-
                        mate, Nell.
                    
                    
                    
                        WHEN MR. SCREECH OWL CAME
                        
                            ONE time a little screech owl flew
                            An' perched right on our barnyard gate,
                            An' papa said we'd see him, too,
                            If Mr. Screech Owl jus' would wait.
                        
                        
                            He rolled his eyes so scared at us,
                            Then flopped up on the corncrib door,
                            'N' turned around 'n' stared at
                                us,
                            'N' rolled his big black eyes some more.
                        
                        
                            That night we heard a spooky noise,
                            An' mamma said, "The screech owl's
                                here"
                            'N' how we wished that we were boys,
                            F'r they don't scare at things that's
                                queer.
                        
                        
                            'N' ever since I've wondered some
                            Whenever I've a screech owl heard,
                            How such awaful noise could come
                            Fr'm such a funny little bird!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        OUR FIRST ALMA MATER
                        
                            CLEAR etched, we bear its image in our mind,
                            The counterpart of thousands of its kind--
                            Red brick, perched jauntily upon a hill,
                            And full of memories that haunt us still.
                            One storied was it--architecture plain--
                            And always with a broken window pane,
                            The wreckage of some ill-aimed stone or ball,
                            Whose havoc brought confusion to us all.
                            It knew no furnace heat, but had, instead,
                            A plain round stove, in color rusty red,--
                            On special days exchanged for shining black
                            That almost brought its look of newness back.
                            That stove was used for other things than heat,
                            By rowdy boys, who knew no greater treat
                            Than just to slip a cartridge on its top,
                            Whose bursting brought all lessons to a stop;
                            Or bits of rubber, slyly smuggled there,
                            With fearsome odors filled the schoolhouse air.
                            The walls were ornamented by some odds
                            And ends of charts--and scores of paper wads--
                            And scribbled up with names and bits of rhyme,
                            Displaying lack of sense and surplus time.
                            The girls each labored on an scratched desk,
                            The boys on one less neat, but picturesque,
                            Much notched and whittled by the busy knife
                            That solaced all their tedious schoolday life.
                        
                        
                            There was the rostrum, where, with spirit sore,
                            In deep disgrace, you "stood upon the floor,"
                            A punishment that lost its crushing force
                            
                            With many repetitions of its course.
                            There was the blackboard, on whose dusty face
                            Some dubious calculation you would trace;
                            Or, if the teacher seemed absorbed in talk,
                            You paused to throw some surreptitious chalk.
                            The floor, of course, was always rough and bare,
                            With many inkspots scattered here and there;
                            And still our memory shudders at the noise
                            Made on it by those clumsy booted boys,
                            Who also loved to scatter match heads there,
                            Which, stepped on, brought the teacher to despair.
                            Such was the spot, where, in the days of yore,
                            We added knowledge to our scanty store,
                            And though we know its aspect was but plain,
                            We seek its equal otherwheres in vain,
                            We may remember college days with pride
                            And an affetion that is deep and wide,
                            But nearer to our hearts we find, in truth,

                            WE little understand the little child,
                            Nor comprehend its nature, shy and wild;
                            And smile at all the fancies it will weave,
                            All prefaced bythe words: "Let'smake
                                believe."
                            We little know the causes hid below
                            The childish faults that vex its elders so,
                            Such as the awful power that we see
                            But dimly, and have called "heredity'--
                            "Unto the fourth generation" not alone,
                            But stretching through the savage Age of Stone
                            To that dim past that knew no human shape,
                            When Man was but a cousin to the Ape.
                            The wayward "moods" of which the parent tells,
                            Seen in their children are reproved as
                                "spells,"
                            And traits by parents frowned on are, alas,
                            Like mirrored visions in a looking glass.
                            Since understanding hearts are all too few,
                            And truth so often sad, as well as true,
                            So it is well each child should first receive
                            This Gift of the Divine--"Let's make
                                believe!"
                        
                        
                            Give them their fancies, then, the brightest rift
                            In skies still dark enough--God's gentle gift
                            To little souls that soon must burdens bear
                            Of grim reality and haunting care.
                            Nor do I hold with those who point out flaws
                            In the reality of Santa Claus,
                            And scoff or jest at aught that is unfurled
                            To childhood by the unseen fairy world.
                            
                            Nay, tell these heartless sticklers for the truth,
                            Who speak of telling children lies, forsooth!
                            That all mankind most comfort hearts that grieve
                            With words that might begin,
                                "Let's make be-
                            lieve!"
                        
                        
                            So leave the little child its world unseen,
                            Nor seek to dim the brightness of its sheen;
                            Too soon shall they be carried by Life's stream
                            Beyond the borders of their childhood's dream,
                            And all too soon shall dawning doubt assail
                            Their fancies of the land "behind the veil,"
                            And later years seek vainly to retrieve
                            The vanished kingdom of " Let's make
                                believe."

                            I've hunted and hunted for one all week"--
                            Such was the task that my hopeful three
                            Year by year have demanded of me.
                        
                        
                            For surely as cometh the season of Yule
                            Come "entertainments" at church and school,
                            And Pegasus answers, like pack mule meek,
                            "Write me a Christmas piece to speak!"
                        
                        
                            Hence came these poems--we must admit,
                            Poor quality goods,--but a guaranteed fit;
                            " Made to order," and hence unique--
                            "Write me Christmas piece to speak!"
                        
                        
                            Fain would mere poet and father reply
                            That such a demand is too great to supply,--
                            Only in answer they urgently shriek:
                            "Write me a Christmas piece to speak!"
                        
                        
                            Brain must rack to win their applause
                            With some quaint, new story of Santa Claus;
                            The spirit was willing--the flesh was weak--
                            " Write me a Christmas piece to speak!"
                        
                        
                            Many a Christmas has swiftly flown--
                            Now are the "speaking" days outgrown;
                            So where may bard inspiration seek,
                            When the Christmas "speakers" no longer speak!

                            TELL you what! I'd like to 've
                                been
                            Where our Christmas times begin;
                            Like to've seen that shining star
                            That the wise men followed far.
                        
                        
                            Like to've seen that little chap,
                            Laughin' in his mother's lap,
                            That the Bible pictures show,
                            Years an' years an' years ago.
                        
                        
                            Christmnas now is well enough--
                            Toys an' candy an' such stuff,--
                            But I believe I'd rather been
                            Where our Christmas times begin!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE RUNAWAY REINDEERS
                        
                            ON Christmas eve, when we had hung our
                                stockin's
                            in a row,
                            And gone to bed to dream about old Santa Claus,
                            you know,
                            But hadn't been asleep at all, when all at once a
                            sleigh
                            came jinglin' up to our front gate--I saw it
                            plain as day--
                            And in the moonlight I could see old Santa's rein-
                            deer team,
                            Just like you see in story books--of course I
                            didn't dream!
                        
                        
                            Then, when I heard old Santa Claus come puffin'
                            up the roof,
                            I leaned 'way out of the window, and t' scare
                                him
                             hollered "WOOF"!
                            And, sir, those reindeers snorted and galloped up
                            the road,
                            And broke their harness and the sleigh, and scat-
                            terd all its load
                            Of candy, toys and Christmas gifts as far as I
                            could see,
                            While Santa Claus went tumblin' down, as mad as
                            mad could be.
                        
                        
                            Then he went tearin' up the road as fast as he
                            could run,
                            While I just cried and cried to think what mischief
                            I had done,
                            
                            And thought of all the little girls and all the little
                            boys
                            Who'd think that Santa'd passed 'em by,
                                just
                            'cause he'd lost their toys--
                            And wondered, if he never more should find his
                            team and sleigh,
                            If he would ever come again in his old fashioned
                            way.
                        
                        
                            And yet I found next morning, when the sun came
                            shining in,
                            The presents hangin' on the wall just like
                                they'd
                            always been,
                            And not a thing along the road or lane or any-
                            where
                            To tell about the runaway that I saw happen
                            there;
                            And I've always, always wondered, since that
                            dreadful Christmas Day,
                            How Santa ever found his toys, his reindeers
                                and
                            his sleigh.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BOY'S CANDIDATE
                        
                            IF all the boys like me could vote, the same as
                                all
                            our pas,
                            The President, if you'd take note, 'u'd
                                soon be
                            Santa Claus,
                            And while the politician men were talkin' politics,
                            Old Santa 'd let 'em jaw--and then distribute
                            candy sticks.
                            Now I can't see what good there'd be in tariffs
                                or
                            free trade--
                            Free Christmas gifts, it 'pears to me,
                                'u'd lay them
                            in the shade;
                            Ner I don't know just what is meant by "regu-
                            latin' trusts,"
                            But I'll make Santa President--unless my traces
                            busts.
                        
                        
                            I think it would be awful nice to have him always
                            here
                            Instead of keepin' him on ice f'r almost all the
                                year,
                            And have a dozen Christmas's with July Fourths
                            between,
                            And we could have it so, I gusss,--if we could
                            vote, I mean.
                            Pa says the women of our land 'll get the
                                votin'
                            right
                            As soon as men all understand they'll have it or
                            they'll fight,
                            
                            But if us boys 'at wear short pants could vote
                                an'
                            make the laws,
                            No Candydate 'u'd have a chance against old
                                Santa
                            Claus!
                        
                        
                            The boys and girls 'u'd cross the sea fr'm
                                every
                            foreign land,
                            They'd come so thick, I s'pose, that we'd
                                have
                            scarcely room to stand--
                            And leave their foreign kings and queens, with
                            whoops and loud hurrahs,
                            F'r what old king amounts to beans, compared to
                            Santa Claus!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A NEW BEATITUDE

                            So lisped, with sure conviction, a little child of
                            Eve;
                            "'N' theemth t' me, if

                        WHEN SANTA WAS A BOY
                        
                            THE other day, my grandpa told me all about
                                the
                            joys
                            He used to have long 'go, when he and Santa Claus
                            were boys;
                            "Oh," grandpa says, "he's lively
                                yet, but he's

                            (Of course the times have changed since then--
                            now you make twice the noise

                            were boys;
                            And yet, with all your airyplanes and motor cars,
                            the day

                            in a sleigh.

                            I'll write a letter right away to send to Santa

                            I want a go cart an' a sled, some dishes an' a

                                right or fair
                            My stockin's have to be so small, while pa's
                                have
                            room to spare!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HOW SANTA CLAUS MISSED HAVING A PASSENGER
                        I HAVE such a awful cold an' I feel so stiff
                            an'
                        old,
                        An' I tell you how it happened, if you p'omise not
                        to scold.
                        I'm so stopped up in my bead, I 'most wish 'at
                            I
                        was dead,
                        An' my papa an' my mamma say I oughta be in
                        bed,--
                        Here it's Christmas morning, too,--it's a pretty
                        how-de-do
                        To feel like you're a hundred, and--escuse me,
                        please--ca-choo!
                        But I had the nicest plan--just you guess it if
                        you can--
                        To play a joke on Santa Claus, the funny, fat, old
                        man!
                        An' 'en to have, beside, the very nicest ride,
                        All 'round the world, an' course you know
                            it's
                        awful big an' wide;
                        But my scheme fell clear flat through, an' feel so
                        sick an' blue,
                        I wish it wasn't Christmas
                            now--s'cuse me, ca-
                        choo, ca-choo!
                        
                            'When Santa climbed our house an, went down th'
                            flue--kersouse--
                            I thought of hiding in his sleigh jus' like a little
                            mouse;
                            
                            He's so jolly an' so kind 'at I knew he
                                wouldn't
                            mind,
                            So, even if he found me, he'd not make me stay
                            behind,
                            'N' I might have done it, too,
                                'n' be with him in-
                            stead of you,
                            If I jus' hadn't gone to sleep--ca-choo,
                                ca-choo,
                            ca-choo!
                        
                        
                            So, when I was sent to bed, y'see I went, instead,
                            An' sat down by the window, with a pillow to my
                            head,
                            An' my cap an' mittens on, for I thought
                                'at long
                            'fore dawn
                            Ol' Santa's sleigh 'u'd come
                                'n' go, then you'd find
                            me gone;
                            An'--cross my heart it's true--the clock struck
                            one an' two
                            Without a sign of Santa Claus--ca-choo, ca-
                            choo, ca-choo!
                        
                        
                            Then next I knew I waked, f'r mamma shaked and
                            shaked,
                            'N' asked me why I'm not in bed--oh my
                                goodness
                            --how I ached!
                            My legs were both asleep, fr'm layin' in a
                                heap,
                            An' th' sun seemed laughin' at me,
                                an'--good
                            gracious--I felt cheap,
                            For I guess 'at you would too, if you waked like
                            that, an' knew
                            That Santa's sleigh had come an' gone--ca-choo,
                            ca-choo, ca-choo!
                        
                        
                        
                            I feel as though I'd freeze, 'n'
                                I'm shaking' at the
                            knees,
                            'N' I know 'at when I go to school the
                                kids 'll tease

                            Perched in a sleigh with Santa Claus, an'

                        THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS
                        
                            PA says the Christmas spirit's easier
                                caught than
                            whoopin' cough,
                            You only get it harder if you try to keep it off;
                            You almost love your en'mies, though you'd
                                really
                            rather not,
                            While as for friends and kindred, you could hug
                            'em on the spot.
                        
                        
                            You get it every season, more reg'lar than the grip,
                            And that don't miss you often, but this
                                gets you
                            every trip;
                            You keep on buyin' presents every time you pass
                            a store,
                            Till the last day before Christmas--when you go
                            and buy some more!
                        
                        
                            It's the only pleasant illness, from the smallpox
                            to the chills,
                            But you suffer a reaction, when you go to pay the
                            bills;
                            But there ain't no use in dodgin'--it's
                                easier
                            caught than mumps,
                            And the more you fight against it, the harder are
                            your bumps.

                        AN AWFUL THOUGHT
                        
                            I'M worried, awful
                                worried, since, a year ago
                            to-day
                            I saw old Santa Claus himself, who looked so old 
                            and gray,
                            That I've been wondrin' ever since just how and
                            when and why
                            The presents would get taken 'round if Santa was
                            to die.
                        
                        
                            It must be dreadful hard on him, a-drivin' here and
                            there,
                            And hoppin' in and out his sleigh all night this time
                            of year;
                            He'd hate to go to doct'rin', now, when business is
                            so thick--
                            I'd like to know where I'd come in if Santa
                                should
                            get sick.
                        
                        
                            So I'm worried, awful worried, since a year ago
                            to-day,
                            When I saw Santa at our church, and I just want
                            to say
                            That what us kids 'u'd like to know is,
                                who's he
                            goin' to hire
                            To take his place among the toys, and drive his
                            "Reindeer Flyer"?
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        DO YOUR CHRISTMAS SHOPPING EARLY
                        
                            I'VE jostled through a crowd for hours,
                                where
                            every one is hurried,
                            And half the folks look angry and all of them look
                            worried;
                            We madly rush from store to store--they're full
                            to overflowing, 
                            And when I'll get my shopping done, the Lord
                            alone is knowing;
                            I would I had a giant's strength and figure big and
                            burly,
                            For I am one who failed to do my Christmas shop-
                            ping early.
                        
                        
                            And when I get inside a store, and think my woe's
                            abating,
                            I find that it has just begun, and stand for ages
                            waiting;
                            By thoughts of the elapsing hours my mind is
                            sorely haunted,
                            So when my turn arrives I've quite forgotten what
                            I wanted;
                            Nor does it comfort me to find that clerks are
                            always surly
                            And cross with folks who fail to do their Christmas
                            shopping early.
                        
                        
                            So what the salesman hands me out I buy without
                            refusing;
                            Where only Hobson's choice is left, what use is
                            there in choosing?'
                            
                            And when my shopping's over, I would call high
                            Heaven to witness
                            That every gift I've chosen is a marvel of unfitness;
                            So I'll heed the words of wisdom--they are
                            golden, they are pearly,--
                            And when NEXT Yuletide comes, I'll do my
                                Christ-
                            mas shopping early!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHERE WAS SANTA CLAUS?
                        
                            Being a smell boy's comment on the discovery of the
                            North Pole.
                        
                        
                            I HEARD the grown folks talk an talk 'bout Peary
                            an' Doc Cook,
                            But I take mighty little stock in the trouble that
                            they took.
                            They didn't find a thing but ice, for all the loud
                            applause--
                            I'd like to ask them once or twice, "Say, where
                            was Santa Claus?"
                        
                        
                            I can't see any earthly use, them frostin' up
                                their
                            toes,
                            An' wearin' out their rawhide shoes among the
                            Eskimos;
                            For when they got up to the Pole, they never
                            'peared to pause
                            To ask themselves, "Upon my soul, now where is
                            Santa Claus?"
                        
                        
                            So when they try to prove they got up there with
                            all their traps,
                            Their observations an' what not, an' all their
                                notes
                            an' maps,
                            No matter what the wise men say, I'Il not believe
                            'em 'cause
                            They make no mention, anyway, of seein' Santa
                            Claus!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SANTA CLAUS AND THE CLIMATE
                        
                            WHEN it's Christmas and
                                Thanksgivin', it's chilly
                            here, we own,
                            Still I wouldn't fancy livin' down in the
                                torrid
                            zone;
                            They may talk about their roses, bloomin' out-
                            doors everywhere,
                            And us with frosted noses, and our trees and bushes
                            bare,
                            But when I see the holly and the ice a-sparklin' so,
                            I think it's lots more jolly to be where there is
                            snow.
                            'N' aside fr'm other reasons, I like our
                                winters
                            'cause
                            I don't believe hot seasons agree with Santa Claus!
                        
                        
                            I can't 'magine him a-drivin' his
                                reindeers an' his
                            sleigh
                            Where vines an flowers are thrivin', the year
                            around, they say;
                            I can't think of him a-goin where naked heathens
                            swarm,
                            With his fur clothes, an' knowin' that
                                it's so awful
                            warm.
                            I've noticed by his pictures that he is round
                                an'
                            fat,
                            An' those fur clothes are fixtures--there's no
                            disputin' that;
                            
                            So I haven't any cravin' t' dress in suits
                                of
                            gauze--
                            Go where the palms are wavin--I'll stay with
                            Santa Claus!
                        
                        
                            Wouldn't fancy always stay'n among the Eskimos,
                            Without a chance for playin' in my bare feet, I
                            s'pose;
                            I like hot summer weather, an' th' fun 'at
                                it can
                            bring,--
                            Like all kinds mixed together in April, 'cause
                                it's
                            Spring;
                            'N' I haven't no objections to
                                'bout three months
                            of Fall--
                            It don't need no corrections, an' of course I
                                like
                            it all--
                            But bring on, in December, yer freezes an' yer
                            thaws,
                            With lots of snow, remember, f'r me an' Santa
                            Claus!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION
                        
                            'LONG just about December first, Pa says,
                                "You
                            can depend,
                            When Christmas comes 'round this year, we ain't
                            a-goin' t' spend
                            As much as we did last year," says be, "
                                an' I don't
                            keer
                            If Christmas, as the people say, does comes but
                            once a year.'"
                        
                        
                            Then 'bout December twenty-third, they both went
                            in a shop,
                            And folks were buying' everywhere, like they's
                                never
                            goin' t' stop,
                            And then, said Pa, "Maria, it's the season of
                                good
                            cheer--
                            We might as well be liberal, Christmas comes but
                            once a year!"
                        
                        
                            But on next New Year's morning , when
                                remembering'
                            what he's spent,
                            And yet a-sorto' puzzlin' where the deuce the
                            money went,
                            Pa says, "Maria, I have made one good resolve,
                            don't fear;
                            We're not a-goin' to spend so much for
                                Christmas
                            gifts, next year."
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE MISTAKES OF SANTA CLAUS
                        
                            OF Kriss Kringle's virtues we hear,
                                goodness sakes,
                            But seldom hear mentioned his frequent mistakes,
                            Just because we all love the jolly old soul
                            Who loafs all the rest of the year at the Pole.
                        
                        
                            But when he leaves balls for the boys he may pass,
                            He should give their fond mothers unbreakable
                            glass;
                            And when he gives foot balls to boys like Jim Jones,
                            He should give them full sets of unbreakable bones.
                        
                        
                            Nor should he give candy and cookies and cake
                            Unless followed by something to cure stomach ache,
                            Or ever give whistles and drums to the boys
                            Without adding attachments to muffle their noise.
                        
                        
                            Nor should he make presents of jewels, 'tis plain,
                            To young ladies, already unreasonably vain,
                            Or offer pianos--alas, there's the rub--
                            To girls whose worst need is a washboard and tub.
                        
                        
                            Yet I'm certain the saddest of all the mistakes
                            Santa Claus on his annual pilgrimage makes,
                            Is to give fewer gifts to the needy and poor
                            And more to the rich, who don't need them,
                                that's
                            sure.
                        
                        
                            But in spite of the errors of judgment he makes,
                            We love Santa Claus, with all his mistakes,
                            And wait for his coming all through the long year,
                            And sing for pure gladness that Christmas is here.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        JUVENILE CHRISTMAS ORATORY
                        
                            TALK of your entertainments! Well, I've
                                gone to
                            ten or more,
                            But none of them were half so swell as ours at
                            Number Four,
                            Though some, of course, had Christmas trees and
                            Santa Claus and such,
                            All rigged up fancy as you please, but really noth-
                            ing much.
                        
                        
                            We have some songs and dialogues--and they're
                            just loads of fun--
                            You dress up in the grown folks' togs, and act like
                            you were one;
                            But oh, the "speaking"! Why, my Pa, he
                                doesn't
                            ever cease
                            To argue it should be the law no child should
                                speak
                            a "piece."
                        
                        
                            You know how little children speak--they sorto'
                            hang their head,
                            And you might listen for a week and not hear half
                            they said;
                            They grind out noble sentiments like they were
                            some machine,
                            Without regard to sound or sense--you know
                            just what I mean.
                        
                        
                        
                            Then Pa quotes what the Scriptures say about
                            "Thou shalt not kill ";
                            Says he, " What happens Chritmas Day? Just
                            answer if you will!
                            Child after child of tender age goes forth in
                            trembling fear
                            And murders poems on the stage, with none to
                            interfere!"
                        
                        
                            For instance, now, there's Janey Blair, a darling
                            little miss,
                            Who sings her pieces, I declare, to some such tune
                            as this:
                            "O hChristmasDaywillsoonbehere,
                            Thegladdestseasonotheyear,
                            WhenSantaClausbringsgiftsandtoys
                            Toallgoodlittlegirlsandboys."
                        
                        
                            Ten Susie Simpkins toddles out, and says, with
                            lisping tone,
                            The piece we're all so proud about--for Susie's
                            awful young--
                            "If Than ty C'auth'eth team
                                runned off,
                            I'd love tothop'em, wouldn't you?
                            'Nd I'd keep all th' toyth my
                                thelf
                            'Nd eat up all th' candy toooo!"
                        
                        
                            Then Tom Smith has a piece that tells about a
                            burning house--
                            The cry of "FIRE!" that Tommy yells sounds like
                            a squealing mouse;
                            
                            Tom's voice is strong enough at play, but gets
                            amazing weak
                            And faint on Recitation Day, when his turn comes
                            to speak.
                        
                        
                            Jim Jones's piece is cute, I guess, but then he
                            snickers so--
                            What it's about, I must confess, I never hope to
                            know--
                            And since our notions of his piece are somewhat
                            dull and dim,
                            We all sit back and laugh like geese-not at the
                            piece, but HIM!
                        
                        
                            Sam Dix went fine until he reached an extra thrill-
                            ing spot,
                            And then some little baby screeched--and Samyel,
                            he forgot--
                            So, many precious future hours, I know I'll vainly
                            spend
                            In puzzling out how, by the Powers, that piece of
                            his could end.
                        
                        But Betty Green--the little dear, no bigger than
                        a bird--
                        Speaks out so loud and plain and clear you never
                        miss a word,
                        And natural as life, you know, and you'll believe,
                        perhaps,
                        When she gets through and starts to go, Pa claps
                        and claps and CLAPS!
                        
                        
                            And, since there isn't any law forbidding kids to
                            speak,
                            I'm here myself, in spite of Pa, to make my little
                            squeak,
                            And wish you all, you understand, before we go
                            away,
                            A very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year's
                            Day!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A PREMATURE DISCOVERY
                        
                            I KNOW the biggest secret, since a week or two
                                ago,
                            I'm sure you'll not drop any hints to anyone
                                you
                            know,--
                            But I was hunting on a shelf, above our attic stairs,
                            And't looked lie Santa Claus, himself, had been
                            there unawares.
                        
                        
                            I've not discovered, even yet, the thing I hunted
                            for,
                            But what I did find there, you bet, was
                                somepin'
                            pleased me more;
                            There was a little bureau there, and jus' the
                            sweetest doll--
                            I was so tickled, I declare, I almost let it fall!
                        
                        
                            There was a dolly's go-cart, too, and lots of pic-
                            ture books,
                            A money-bank, all painted blue, a rollin' pin like
                            cook's,
                            And best of all --it s'prised me so I almost fell,
                            ker-plunk -
                            The cutest dolly clothes, you know, in jus' the
                            sweetest trunk.
                        
                        
                            Then I crawled down and ran away, and hopped
                            and skipped, I did,
                            And never breathed it till today, where all those
                            thing. were hid;
                            
                            Of course I wouldn't tell it now to anyone but you,
                            You mus'n't breathe it, anyhow, but cross my
                            heart, it's true!
                        
                        
                            My parents mus'n't know I found those things at
                            >all, because
                            They want to fool me, I'll be bound, about old
                            Santa Claus,
                            So when I see them Christmas Day, I'l open up
                            my eyes
                            As though I don't know what to say, I feel so much
                            surprise.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AN AFTER CHRISTMAS LAMENT
                        
                            IT'S lots of fun when Christmas Day is
                                still
                            a-comin' yet,
                            And you're a-buyin' things for folks, an'
                                waond'rin'
                            what you'll get;
                            But now it isn't half so nice, for Christmas time is
                            past,
                            And 'pears like all the toys I got were just too
                            nice to last!
                        
                        
                            My nice new dolly that could talk will scarcely
                            even squeak;
                            Pa says its lungs is failin' fast--I've had it
                                but
                            week;
                            My patent top won't spin no more--it was the
                            mostest fun;
                            My train of cars are just the same-I just can't
                            make 'em run.
                        
                        
                            I've et my Christmas candy up--don't want it
                            anyhow;
                            Seems like there's nothin' I can eat that
                                tastes
                            half decent now;
                            And Ma's dosed me on castor oil an' liver pills
                                an'
                            such 
                            Till I declare, ef I should die, I wouldn't mind it
                            much!
                        
                        
                        
                            So, while it's nice when Christmas Day is still
                            a-comin' yet,
                            An' you're a-thinkin' what you want, an' wond'rin'
                            what you'll get,
                            But now that it has come and gone my pleasure
                            sort o' leaks,
                            To think it won't be here again for more tban forty
                            weeks!
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    FROM FURROW AND FIELD
                    
                    
                        FROM FURROW AND FIELD
                        
                            SPRING has waked old Earth from sleeping, so
                                at
                            last my plow is creeping
                            At its labors, and there's music in the field,
                            For the angry killdeer's scolding, for the plodding
                            plow I'm holding
                            Means danger to the nest she has concealed.
                        
                        
                            There are swallows swiftly diving just ahead of
                            where I'm driving,
                            Where a feast of flitting insects they shall find;
                            While the glossy blackbirds scatter, with a world
                            of saucy chatter,
                            For their dinner in the furrow just behind.
                        
                        
                            Slowly on my plowshare burrows, turning one by
                            one the furrows
                            That shall open to the sun the mellow soil,
                            And my spirit, as I follow, grows as lightsome as
                            the swallow--
                            For plowing is Contentment masked as Toil!
                        
                        
                            And we dream of harvest's coming, when the
                            reapers will be humming,
                            And bring the full fruition of the yield;
                            First the sowing, then the gleaning--there lies
                            half Life's hidden meaning--
                            A sermon from the furrow and the field!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        PLOWING
                        
                            OUR tastes are apt to differ 'bout
                                th' things we
                            like to do--
                            An' what I think most pleasant may seem a bore
                            to you--
                            But no other work I tackle can suit me, anyhow,
                            Like when th' ground gets mellow an' I'm
                                startin'
                            in to plow!
                        
                        
                            It keeps y'r body busy, but y'r mind's
                                left free to
                            roam;
                            Y'r feet plod in th' furrow, but y'r
                                spirit's not at
                            home,
                            An' I reckon that's th' reason, as
                                I'm sa'in' to
                            you now,
                            That of all th' kinds of workin', it suits me
                                beat
                            to plow.
                        
                        
                            Sometimes y'r mind is musin' on what's
                                past for
                            forty year,
                            Sometimes it's in th' future--oh, it's
                                anywhere.
                            but here;
                            You've as fine a chance for thinkin' as
                                you'll ever
                            have, I vow,
                            When y'r mind starts out to wander while
                                y'r'
                            followin' th' plow!
                        
                        
                            You have no one by to bother--you're serenely
                            all alone--
                            Though y'r thoughts are interrupted when y'r
                            plowpoint strikes a stone,
                            
                            But I'm gener'ly as happy as a bluebird on a
                            bough
                            When the ground gets warm an' mellow, an'
                                I'm
                            startin' out to plow.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        "FARMER'S INSTITOOT"
                        
                            EXCITEMENT's rising ev'rywhere, all through our
                            neighborhood,
                            Almost as though the County Fair had settled
                            >there for good.
                            Now in the city, I suppose, where lots of things
                            occcur,
                            Such things grow tiresome, goodness knows, and
                            make but little stir;
                            But where we know our neighbors all, and their
                            affairs, to boot,
                            You'll find the interest is not small in "
                                Farmer's

                            For here we dig our daily bread from the sweet
                            smelling soil,
                            Or change it into gold, instead, by alchemy of toil;
                            And here the dweller in the town, when on the
                            street he stops,
                            From minister and banker down, will ask about the
                            crops,
                            And even the editor longs to learn of bogs and
                            cows and fruit,
                            And hails with joy the glad return of "Farmer's

                            Bring forth your knotty problems, then, whose

                            Pour forth the knowledge that for years your
                            intellect has stored--
                            But kindly stop when it appears the audience is
                            bored;
                            Let all the errors of the past be dug out, branch
                            and root,
                            Upon this mission comes at last the "Farmer's
                            Institoot."
                        
                        
                            If in our farming, then, to-day, we'd keep up with
                            the crowd,
                            We find, as railroad tickets say, "no stop-over
                            allowed,"
                            And that the methods Adam used in Eden's realms
                            of bliss,
                            Which, in his day, might be excused, would never
                            do in this;
                            Our fathers did the best they could-let this no
                            man dispute
                            Who has, to help him to make good, the

                            Then let us hail the Institoot, its talks on cows
                            and corn,
                            How we may teach sheep not to root, and how
                            hogs should be shorn,
                            How we should bring our children up--or some-
                            times "take them down"
                            With brimming plenty fil our cup, and also feed
                            the town,
                            
                            For aid in all these many ways, we here and now
                            salute,
                            with words of gratitude and praise, the "Far-

                        A SIGN OF SPRING
                        
                            THERE are many signs and symptoms to show
                            when spring is here,
                            And some, like "early robins," are but false
                            alarms, I fear,
                            But I feel a glad assurance that we're done with
                            winter's yoke
                            When I hear the bass and tenor of the Bull Frog
                            Chorus croak.
                        
                        
                            Their music ever fills my heart with a resistless
                            joy,
                            Such unlimited rapture as is given to a boy;
                            So for me no sweeter music ever yet the silence
                            broke
                            Than to hear the hoarse musicians of the Bull
                            Frog Chorus croak.
                        
                        
                            All life seems just beginning to bud and bloom
                            anew,
                            The sun shines bright and cheery and the sky
                            grows soft and blue;
                            Let me idly watch while summer swiftly dons her
                            emerald cloaks,
                            And hark to winter'. requiem, as the Bull Frog
                            Chorus croaks!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHEN I GET TO THINKING'
                        
                            SOMETIMES I get to thinkin', say when
                                evenin's
                            comin' on,
                            And I've mebbe been. a-plowin' ever since the
                                early
                            dawn,--
                            Till a crowd of recollections seem to take me back
                            as plain
                            To my childhood--second mebbe, leastways
                                I'm
                            a child again.
                        
                        
                            I can see the old red schoolhouse, back among the
                            maple trees,
                            'Long about in early summer, and even the bumble
                            bees,

                            grow!
                        
                        
                            Doggone! Wisht I was back there with a crowd
                            of onery boys
                            With th' same old desp'ret longin'

                            f'r noise.
                            By the schoolhouse was a sawmill, where we'd fool
                            with wheels and belts,
                            An, not quit f'r wrathful owners, ner school bells

                            I remember that old sawmill jus' as well as yester-

                            Makes a feller kind o' lonesomelike an' sort

                            But howsoever, I do feel some damp about th' eyes.
                        
                        
                            Still, I often get to thinkin' 'at when this

                            cares are gone,
                            A better world'lI take the place of the one
                                we're
                            travellin' on;
                            Take, f'r instance, in th' twilight, when you go
                                out
                            to the bars,
                            An' look up fr'm this world's shadders to
                                th' ever-
                            lasting stars.
                        
                        
                        
                            Seems t' make this globe we're standin' on
                                seem
                            most almighty small,
                            Yet broadens out a man's idees an' fancies,
                                after
                            all;
                            Then you start home through th' twilight, fireflies
                            sparklin' ev'rywhere,
                            With y'r own fireside a-shinin' and y'r
                                wife to meet
                            you there.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        NOONTIME IN HARVEST
                        
                            I S'POSE that no two minds agree in views
                                of Para-
                            dise--
                            You'd have a different heaven from me--we differ
                            otherwise;
                            But my idee, I'll tell you soon, if it could come to
                            pass,
                            Is just filled up by harvest noon--to flatten on
                            the grass
                            And squint up at the cloudless sky through holes
                            in y'r straw hat,
                            With kind o' dreamy, half shut eye--but wide
                            awake, at that!
                        
                        
                            With whiffs of dryin' clover hay a-fillin' all the
                                air,
                            Fresh from the fields, as though to say that you
                            were needed there;
                            The raincrow hollerin' P'r rain, and ev'ry
                                maple
                            leaf
                            Turned upside down, to make it plain y'r
                                noonin'
                            should be brief.
                            The things we shouldn't have, you know, are
                            sweetest to the taste,
                            Hence our First Parents, long ago, that "fruit"
                            devoured in baste.
                        
                        
                            So, while we may not all agree in views of Para-
                            dise,
                            I'l take, for ine, a shady tree and lay with half
                            shut eyes,
                            
                            Just dreamin of the days when that was all I had
                            to do--
                            To blink up through my old straw hat- and
                            tired of it, too!
                            And yet, that clover smell at last brings to my
                            mind, to-day,
                            The time f'r dozin' here is past--we must be
                            makin' hay!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHEN FRUIT TREE AGENTS COME
                        
                            WHEN fruit tree agents come, even Eloquence
                            grows dumb,
                            As they display their colored plates of apple,
                            peach or plum;
                            It was thus, as I conceive, that the Serpent tempted
                            Eve--
                            He had some colored plates along, I verily believe;
                            So I never fail to buy, though I always wonder
                            why,
                            For though I plant with loving care, the blame
                            things always die!
                        
                        
                            I behold each colored plate, then succumbing to
                            my fate,
                            I order with an ardor disappointment can't abate;
                            For those master works of art do so fascinate my
                            heart,
                            As the cheerfulest of martyrs with my money I
                            will part;
                            That I get but little fruit is, I fear, beyond dis-
                            pute,
                            Yet when I see those colored plates my common
                            sense is mute.
                        
                        
                            I have planted trees for years, I have watered
                            them with tears,
                            But they have never borne such fruit as on those
                            plates appear.;
                            So I fear that it is true peach or plum of rainbow
                            hue
                            
                            Will never in this world of woe appear upon my
                            view,
                            And that I shall find a dearth, on this disappoint-
                            ing earth,
                            Of fruits that may compare with them in gaudiness
                            and girth.
                        
                        
                            There are times when I surmise that those plates
                            of colored lies
                            Much of our life experience may seem to symbolize;
                            Even so we turn our glance, from the rainbows of
                            Romance,
                            To somber hued Reality, and look at it askance,
                            And the plans we plant with care and whose future
                            seemed so fair
                            Are strangely disappointing in the fruit they come
                            to bear.
                        
                        
                            But when fruit tree agents come, though at first
                            I'm grim and glum,
                            When I behold those colored plates I sullenly
                            succumb;
                            It was thus, as I conceive, that the Serpent tempted
                            Eve--
                            I feel her disappointment, and in sympathy I
                            grieve;
                            And my spirit sorely sighs for some perfect para-
                            dise,
                            Where the fruit tree agent's pictures may grow
                            real before my eyes!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        TWO POINTS OF VIEW
                        
                            MY city cousin thinks it's fine
                            To listen to the "lowing kine,"
                            But farmers, I can tell you now,
                            All hate to hear a bawlin' cow!
                        
                        
                            She talks about "the dewy mead"--
                            That does sound pretty nice, indeed,
                            Till you remember all that gas
                            Is just about a field of grass!
                        
                        
                            She raves about "the lovely rocks"
                            That lie about my fields in flocks,
                            And says they make enchanting "scenes"-
                            They're mighty hard on my machines!
                        
                        
                            She says she daily praises God
                            For " giving her the golden rod"--
                            If she had all those weeds, to mow
                            She'd wish He hadn't let 'em grow!
                        
                        
                            She "loves the little brooklet's
                                charm"--
                            It cuts the best part of my farm;
                            If by that "brooklet" she should plow,
                            She'd wish it wasn't there, I vow.
                        
                        
                            No modern houses catch her eye,
                            But when some run down shack she'll spy,
                            She'll gather up her paints and brush,
                            And paint and paint--and gush and gush!
                        
                        
                        
                            The farm scenes that appeal to me
                            She never even seems to see,
                            And every picture she'll commence
                            Is full of weeds and old rail fence.
                        
                        
                            For she's an artist and her art
                            And common sense are far apart--
                            My good old motto always was
                            That "handsome is that handsome does!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Ã†STHETICS ON THE FARM
                        
                            US farmers in the country cannot live on
                                pretty
                            views,
                            Yet I'm thankful for the beauty in the common
                            things we use;
                            So I joy in the greenness of the grass and trees
                            in spring,
                            And am tickled as the children when the birds
                            begin to sing.
                        
                        
                            So I often think the fruit trees, with their load of
                            snowy bloom,
                            If that were all they ever bore, would be no waste
                            of room,
                            And that the wavin', golden fields of yellow ripened
                            grain,
                            If only good to look at, would not quite have
                            grown in vain.
                        
                        
                            I am thankful for the colors of the forests in the
                            fall,
                            With the haze of Indian Summer sort of dreaming
                            over all,
                            And I like to see the blanket of white and gleaming
                            snow
                            That old Winter spreads down softly when all
                            other beauties go.
                        
                        
                            And if God put grace and beauty in such things
                            as harmful weeds,
                            
                            I'm glad he left a little for the things that fill our
                            needs,
                            And that while He put the rainbow in the shower's
                            shining drops,
                            They can also put the color in us farmers' growing
                            crops.
                        
                        
                            Let the rich man in the city the high toned paint-
                            ings buy--
                            Not one of them can equal the sunset in the sky
                            That the Master Artist colors, for all who care to
                            see,--
                            So the Almighty's works of art are good enough
                            for me.
                        
                        
                            So I see no use in pining for the beauties man has
                            made,
                            Since Nature's works are free to all--and lay
                            them in the shade;
                            Though we can't exist entirely on scenery and
                            views,
                            Let's be thankful for the beauty in the common
                            things we use!

                            ON BANUETS

                            excuses--
                            They strike him as too fancy f'r common

                            If you'll just treat y'r neighbors white

                            ON MODERN LITERATURE
                            Bill says our readin' nowadays, he thinks, is
                            mostly slop,--
                            Words poured in by the bar'l--sense put in by
                            th' drop--
                            A fraction of an inch of beer--a foot of froth
                            on top.

                                Do not doubt it's sinful--
                                Still, I think it serves
                                As a sort o' safety valve
                                F'r a man with nerves.

                        THE CROSSROADS
                        
                            THE country crossroads! How it lingers still
                            In memory, as humdrum places will.
                            Its four roads to our youthful eyes unfurled
                            Led to the utmost ends of all the world;
                            What though the iron signboards, pointing down,
                            Merely directed to some nearby town,
                            We knew those roads their course would onward
                            wend
                            Forever more, and never find an end.
                            They always beckoned us to venture forth,
                            No matter where, East, West or South or North.
                            We longed to follow them, as children must,
                            inheriting the primal Wanderlust,
                            Wherefore we envied every gypsy camp,
                            And all but envied even the homeless tramp.
                            'Tis true that many crossroads mark the miles
                            Of our long journey to the afterwhiles,
                            But this, the first my barefoot youth had known,
                            Shall ever seem peculiarly my own.
                            A giant locust grew there in its pride,
                            And cast its grateful shadows far and wide;
                            Upon its trunk ere countless tacks and nails,
                            Mementos left by many "Public Sales";
                            Above were signboards--somewhat old and
                            brown--
                            To point the way to every nearby town,
                            But these had drawn so many marksmen's lead
                            That, latterly, they scarcely could be read.
                            Nearby, in those beloved days of yore,
                            A monster sign of some old clothing store
                            
                            Became the target of our boyish aim,
                            So clods or snowballs often hid the name.
                            That sign would seldom fail to leave the scene
                            Upon the joyous night of Hallowe'en.
                            Old crossroads! We have sought you in the snow,
                            On passing bobsleds, in the long ago,
                            And sought you in the summer's heat and drouth,
                            With panting breath and dust encircled mouth,
                            Then dashed on madly shuffling in the dust,
                            To personate a railroad train, I trust--
                            But stopping very quickly, with a groan,
                            When our bare feet have met a hidden stone.
                            No more upon thy roads I'm faring on,
                            And all the landmarks of my youth are gone,
                            For in these latter days, with taste depraved,
                            They've graded down thy slopes and thou art
                            
                                paved!
                            
                            The signboards and the sign alike are gone,
                            Even as the snowballs that we "pasted" on,
                            But I shall carry to my last abode
                            The loving memory of the old Crossroad!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AN OLD TIMER'S FIRE
                        
                            I ALWAYS liked a fire like that,
                            That you can see as well as feel--
                            It never did just strike me pat
                            To have my fire caged in steel.
                        
                        
                            A fireplace, wide, and made of brick,
                            With big black chimney up above--
                            That makes a fire a man can stick
                            His feet up to, and sort o' love.
                        
                        
                            If we could have a spinnin' wheel,
                            And Sary here to make it hum,
                            My old heart ould begin to feel
                            It was old times--or Kingdom come!
                        
                        
                            The old things, though, are dead and gone,
                            And nary one is left, to-day,
                            But my old feet still travellin' on
                            By my old fire, the old-time way.

                            in our beliefs;
                            But we'd allus feel so sorry-like, when evenin'
                                come

                            When
                            The
                            Sun
                            Went
                            Down.
                        
                        
                            An' wunst we went a-fishin', to be back at
                                supper
                            time,
                            With some partin' admonishens not t' drownd
                                our-
                            selves, ner climb
                            Fer birds-nests, ner to lose ourselves by goin' off 
                            too far;
                            At last we started down th' crick t' where them
                            sicamores are,
                            'N' watched th' sun awhile
                                'n' wished 'at he'd turn 
                            off th' steam,
                            
                            'N' jest set still awhile, like us, an'
                                watch th' lazy
                            stream;
                            Then first we knowed, a little star was laughin' like
                            a clown,
                            But we felt awful bad, that time,
                            When
                            The
                            Sun
                            Went
                            Down!
                        
                        
                            But things changed some, an' I declare, there
                            growed up, by 'n' by,
                            A sort of friendship 'twixt th' evenin'
                                hours an'
                            I--
                            I'd watch th' sunset, with its heaps of purple,
                                red
                            n' gold,
                            But with a diff'rent feelin' fr'm
                                th' one I had of
                            old;
                            I'd fancy they was castles, th' big clouds
                                'at I
                            'u'd see,

                            one else 'n' me--
                            Then, when there was a spellin' bee er
                                party, I'll
                            be boun',
                            I wasn't sorry, no sirree,
                            When
                            The
                            Sun
                            Went
                            Down.
                        
                        
                        
                            Them happy days are dead 'n' gone, an' I
                                can only
                            say
                            I wouldn't mind so much t' pass eternity
                                thataway;
                            Yet I've been happy mostly sence an' surely
                                can't
                            complain,

                            rain,
                            But, nowadays, I watch th' sun, fer th' most

                            t' tell
                            When, in the common run o' things, I'll hear
                                th'
                            dinner bell,

                                laziest man
                            in town,
                            Yet I don't mourn s' very
                                much
                            When
                            The
                            Sun
                            Goes
                            Down.
                        
                        I us' to be ambishus, but I ain't so any more,
                        'N' don't care much fer riches, though
                            I'd rather
                        not be pore,
                        'N' fame er power haven't got much influence
                            with
                        me--
                        Although I own I'd rather like t' be township
                        trustee.
                        I think, sometimes, about th' best 'at any man
                        can do,
                        At least a ordinary man, about like me er you,
                        
                        Is jest t' see a few true friends in sorrow gathered

                        To brighten up th' hour of death

                        Sun
                        Goes
                        Down!
                    
                    
                    
                        YET ONE MORE YEAR
                        
                            SEEMS only just a week ago, or scarce a year,
                                at
                            least,
                            A homeless, friendless sort of chap came out here
                            from back East--
                            That chap was me, and in those days, I tell you
                            now I guess
                            That as for this world's riches, one couldn't
                                have
                            much less;
                            I met a farmer needing help, and then my way
                            seemed clear,
                            And I told him if things suited, perhaps I'd stay
                            a year.
                        
                        
                            Well, the days and weeks and months all seemed to
                            go a-sliding past,
                            I'd never thought that time could fly half so
                            amazin' fast;
                            The woods's turned from green to gold and then
                            got bare and brown,
                            And, 'fore you'd time to mourn for 'em,
                                the snow
                            came siftin' down;
                            The boss then came around and said, you'd
                            better stay right here,"
                            To which I answered promptly that I'd stay
                            another year.
                        
                        
                            Folks all said that he had bank stock and owned a
                            dozen farms,
                            And he had a sweestfaced daughter, with twice that
                            many charms,
                            
                            And she was rich--I dont mean money, but as
                            all good women are,--
                            In faith and love and duty, changeless as the
                            Northern Star;
                            And when we married--since at home her duty's
                            path lay clear--
                            I laughed and said I reckoned I must stay another
                            year.
                        
                        
                            Ah me! How long the shadows of Life's afternoon
                            have grown!
                            I am sitting in its evening shades--thank heaven,
                            not alone!
                            For I watch a white haired woman as her busy
                            fingers fly,
                            And see the same sweet face I knew in the days so
                            long gone by;
                            And when the final summons of Death's messenger
                            I hear,
                            I expect I'll answer faintly, "'Let me
                                stay yet one
                            more year!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WILD FLOWERS
                        
                            I LOVE the flowers that grow in pots,
                            or bloom along our garden walks,
                            Like pansies and forget-me-nots,
                            Geraniums and hollyhocks.
                        
                        
                            I love 'em--but with no such love
                            As I remember, when a child,
                            I felt as I would bend above
                            The forest flowers, growing wild
                        
                        
                            In green and fresh leaved timberlands
                            And stumpy "clearings," oozing wet,
                            Where, fairly leaping to our hands,
                            Bloomed many a little violet.
                        
                        
                            We called them "johnny-jump-ups " then,
                            A name that shamed their modest blue,
                            While the spring beauties of the glen
                            Were "daisies," then, to me and you.
                        
                        
                            We gathered that evangel, "Jack,"
                            In his green "pulpit" preaching there,
                            And kept his onion rootlet back
                            Wherewith some guileless youth to snare.
                        
                        
                            The dogwood's sprays of waxen white
                            Their snowy glories would unfold,
                            And swamps grow golden to our sight
                            With acres of marsh marigold.
                        
                        
                        
                            Here, lending fragrance to the air,
                            Sweet Williams showed their pallid blue;
                            With lace-like leaves beside them there
                            Great clumps of "bachelor's breeches
                                "grew.
                        
                        
                            Before our ruthless hands they'd fall--
                            We had a miser's thoughtless greed,
                            Nor thanked the Mother of us all
                            For being lavish with her seed.
                        
                        
                            Here plucked a flower--there a fern--
                            Not yet the lust of conquest stilled,
                            Nor would our footsteps homeward turn
                            Until our tired hands were filled.
                        
                        
                            We gave the product of our toils
                            To some fair sweetheart of our youth,
                            Who shyly praised our woodland spoils--
                            And they were beautiful, in truth,
                        
                        
                            She took them with unstudied grace,
                            That little mistress of our heart,
                            And gazed at them with thoughtful face,
                            And then--she took them all apart.
                        
                        
                            We thought them beautiful before--
                            She sorted them and rearranged;
                            Ah, then what loveliness they wore--
                            They were the same, yet oh how changed!
                        
                        
                        
                            Today I find these faded flowers,
                            Pressed with some withered autumn leaves--
                            So mingled are our April showers
                            With Winter's death and Summer's sheaves.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHEN THE " SIGN" IS RIGHT
                        
                            THERE's folks who don't believe
                                in " signs," but as
                            fer me, I do;
                            Ef you only take 'em rightly they allus come
                            true:--
                            Fer instance, when yer fishin', ef the fish
                                don't
                            bite,
                            You kin count on it fer certain that the sign ain't
                            right.
                        
                        
                            You mus' allus plant yer taters when the sign is
                            in the heart,
                            Fer of you don't they'll rot an' blight
                                an' go wrong
                            from the start.
                            I see some folks are plantin' corn, but ef you look
                            tonight
                            You'll findout that the phases of the moon
                                ain't
                            right.
                        
                        
                            Besides, it's goin' to rain all week, an'
                                so without
                            a doubt
                            The corn that they're a-plantin 'll just
                                drowned
                            out.
                            How do I know? My goodness sakes! It's just
                            as plain as plain,
                            When the moon's turned over, w'y it can't
                                hold
                            rain!
                        
                        
                            There's a sign fer killin' thistles an' it
                                never
                            fails,--
                            
                            You cut 'em when the sign is right an'
                                they're dead
                            as nails;
                            But cut 'em when it isn't,
                                an' you'll find it so,
                            It sorto' stimmylates 'em an' makes
                                'em grow !
                        
                        
                            There's folks who laugh at
                                "powwowin'" fer peo-
                            ple that are sick,
                            But ef you do it rightly it'll do the trick--
                            A man must tell a woman, an' a woman tell a man,
                            An' then if it don't cure you,
                                w'y there's nothin'
                            can!
                        
                        
                            They "powwoed" Mattie's baby when it had
                                the
                            flesh decay,
                            An' it was just surprisin', it got better right
                            away;
                            Of course I know the doctors laugh, an' say it
                            isn't so,
                            But I maintain there's lots of things that they
                            don't know!
                        
                        
                            So of the luck's agin ou as you go along,
                            You kin put it down as certain that the sign's been
                            wrong;
                            Yer crops are certain sure to rot an' rust an
                            blast an' blight
                            Unless you do yer workin' when the sign's just
                            right.
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
                    
                    
                        LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
                        
                            LIGHTS and shadows! Weirdly wrought,
                            Interlaced and strangely blended
                            In our lives and ending not
                            Till our little journey's ended.
                        
                        
                            Lights of virtue--shades of sin--
                            Woven through all things, and jumbled;
                            The Great Weaver wrought them in,-
                            May we own them and be humbled.
                        
                        
                            Neither seek out overmuch
                            To distinguish and appraise them,
                            He Who knows what made them such
                            In His truer balance weighs them.
                        
                        
                            Lights of pleasure--shades of pain--
                            Each a blessing to he heeded,
                            Even so both sun and rain
                            For the rainbow's hues are needed.
                        
                        
                            Lights and shadows intertwined,
                            Forming thus Life's strange mosaic;
                            Blended ever so we find
                            The sublime and the prosaic.
                        
                        
                            Lights andShadows! These make Life
                            Good and evil oddly shuffled--
                            Peace attained through bitter strife
                            When the cannon's roar is muffled.
                        
                        
                        
                            You, whose hands have taken up
                            Every prize we struggle after,
                            Know the sweet and bitter cup,
                            Unshed tears and lilting laughter.
                        
                        
                            You, who know Earth's wealth and woe,
                            And, in part, their hidden meaning--
                            Take these lights and shades I show,
                            May you find them worth the gleaning!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        IT IS NOT GOOD THAT MAN SHOULD BE ALONE
                        
                            HIS wife felt highly honored by a call to
                                represent
                            Her Club at State Convention--need I remark,
                            she went?
                            And when she took the homeward track, her stay
                            was far from short;
                            The Club expected--and received--a quite de-
                            tailed "Report."
                            She told of essays and debates and speeches by the
                            score--
                            The story was a sea of words, without a friendly
                            shore.
                            What of her husband, all the while--did nothing,
                            then, occur
                            To him, poor humble mortal, when so much trans-
                            pired with her?
                            He occupied the background, his role was darkly
                            dim,
                            And hence I offer to the world this brief
                                "report"
                            on him!
                        
                        
                            On returning from the depot, to find himself alone,
                            He spent a busy hour at his faithful telephone,
                            In inviting all his cronies to a little stag affair--
                            "A high old time, remember, and be sure that you
                            are there."
                            Well, they "came and saw and conquered"--not
                            a wife was there to vex,--
                            And departed--after midnight--and talk about
                            your wrecks!
                            
                            Why, an earthquake and a cyclone and a food all
                            rolled in one
                            Might give some faint conception of the damage
                            that was done!
                            When he gets up in the morning--and, of course,
                            he oversleeps--
                            He doesn't feel like working much-but work
                            lies 'round in heaps;
                            The furniture seems dusty, it's a crying sin and
                            shame,
                            For anywhere he touches he can autograph his
                            name;
                            But he's hungry, direly hungry, so he builds a
                            roaring fire,
                            And in the process piles the dirt a little fraction
                            higher.
                            Thinks he, "I'll bake potatoes for the mainstay
                            of the meal;
                            I like 'em better mashed or fried, but then
                                they'd
                            be to peel."
                            He next explores the cupboard--the result is
                            deep disgust,
                            And the dirty house dismays him, so he straight-
                            way starts to dust.
                            Well, he dusts and dusts and dusts and dusts, till
                            he can dust no more,
                            And then the thought occurs to him he'd
                                better
                            sweep the floor;
                            You know. how all the men folks sweep--they do
                            it on the share,
                            
                            That is, leave half the dirt behind--the rest goes
                            in the air!
                            But when he finished, what he said would shock my
                            pious pen,--
                            The furniture seemed dusty--so he dusted it
                            again!
                            He noticed, now, the furniture had a prim and
                            proper look,
                            Like a bunch of kindergartners when they "have
                            their pictures took ";
                            So he sought to rearrange it in a careless, home-
                            like way,
                            With a result that brought to mind the woes of
                            "moving day."
                            "Well, anyhow, it's clean at last, and now
                                I'm
                            going to eat;
                            Why, even baked potatoes would begin to be a
                            treat!"
                            He opened up the oven door--the kitchen filled
                            with smoke--
                            There was a smoky flavor to the few, brief words
                            he spoke!
                            Thinks he, "I'll drink some coffee and eat un-
                            leavened bread,"
                            But when he gulped the coffee, oh, the awful words
                            he said.
                            I'll not repeat them to you now--they'd jar my
                            jogging verse,
                            For half of them were swearwords--and the other
                            half were worse!
                            Oh, salt and sugar are as twins in superficial looks,
                            
                            But to confuse them damages the very best of
                            cooks.
                            "Now," said "our noble hero," as
                                the Alger
                            Books would say,
                            " I'll have to go down town or fast the balance
                                of
                            the day;
                            Oh, talk of starving Belgians and Polanders and
                            Serbs,
                            And I'm like Nebuchadnezzar, on a fare of hay and
                            herbs!"
                            I would not harrow up your souls or start your
                            trickling tears,
                            Suffice to say, the day dragged on like six or seven
                            years,
                            And when, at last, upon his couch he laid his
                            weary head,
                            He sadly groaned, "I wish to --- somebody'd
                            made the bed!
                            Then every quilt and sheet began to slowly, surely
                            glide,
                            Like an animated glacier or the big Culebra Slide,
                            And all night long those fiendish things slid on and
                            seemed to say,
                            " We don't know where we're going, but
                                we're on
                            the way!"
                            Now in such trying case as this, you scarcely need
                            be told,
                            Mon' language alays is as hot as the real of him
                            is cold;
                            So I can't quote our hero here, in presence of the
                            ladies,
                            
                            For several of the words he used were synonyms
                            for Hades.
                            Need I prolong this agony? Suffice it, then, to
                            say,
                            These things--with variations--were repeated,
                            day by day;
                            The food was underdone or burnt, it choked the
                            family cat;
                            There always was too much of this or not enough
                            of that;
                            So let us multiply the woes of this heartrending
                            day
                            By just the number of the days that woman was
                            away.
                            Then she came back and asked him, "How on
                            earth he got along?"
                            Says he, "Oh, fine, why everything just went off

                            Imagination was her forte--
                            She slightly stretched the wild report,
                            And said the case bad gone to court.
                        
                        
                            FOURTH VERSION
                            Then Mrs. Thompson heard the tale,
                            And hurried forth with visage pale
                            To spread the news, and weep and wail.
                            She said she heard that Brown's poor wife
                            Had been assaulted with a knife,
                            And was in danger of her life.
                        
                        
                            THE SUCCEEDING VERSIONS
                            The tale thus brought from feeble birth,
                            Now grown to monstrous size and girth,
                            Is scattered broadcast on the earth;
                            For later versions of the tale
                            My truthful pen would faint and fail--
                            The tadpole's larger than a whale!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        I SAID IN MY HASTE
                        
                            HE was a liar from his birth,
                            And till he "lies" in Mother Earth,
                            We know how much his words are worth--
                            Call him brother--
                            For Conscience looks us in the eye,
                            And to our jeering makes reply
                            In words we can not well deny,
                            "You're another."
                        
                        
                            He lies, when, it must be confessed,
                            The simple truth had suited best;
                            He never lets his talent rest--
                            Call him brother--
                            Remembering the fatal fact
                            The dish you broke "was always cracked,"
                            And though your lies may pass as tact--
                            You're another.
                        
                        
                            And he will put the truth to rout
                            Most brilliantly, beyond a doubt,
                            When he is easiest found out--
                            Call him brother--
                            The rest of us our lies will keep
                            For times when truth is buried deep,
                            While the Recording Angels weep--
                            You're another.
                        
                        
                            He lies without a thought of pelf
                            Or of advantage to himself,
                            
                            And hides the truth upon the shelf--
                            Call him brother--
                            The slightest falsehood gives you pain
                            That is,--if it be clearly plain
                            That it will no advantage gain--
                            You're another.
                        
                        
                            As for deceiving me or you,
                            The only way that he might do
                            Would be to tell us what is true--
                            Call him brother--
                            For we who do not always lie
                            Can sometime do it on the sly
                            Nor wake the echoing reply,
                            "You're another."
                        
                        
                            We call our little lies "polite"
                            And fondly think they're tinted white,
                            While his are black as darkest night--
                            Call him brother--
                            Lest when we stand at Peters's Gate
                            And hear our liar told his fate,
                            The Saint may turn to us and state,
                            "You're another."
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE SEAMY SIDE
                        
                            THE wings of memory bear me back, today,
                            To childhood's castles in the air and dreams;
                            All things seemed lovely, then, along the way--
                            I did not then behold Life's ragged seams
                        
                        
                            The loving light of innocence redeems
                            The sordidness from mean, unlovely things--
                            I did not then behold Life's ragged seams;
                            Hope had not folded her disabled wings.
                        
                        
                            O happy days, now vanished long ago--
                            I did not then behold Life's ragged seams ;
                            Mine untried eyes not yet had leared to know
                            The shadows with which all existence teems.
                        
                        
                            I did not then behold Life's ragged seams;
                            Earth shone in splendor to my guileless eyes;
                            Would that I still might hold the truth that gleams,
                            Through darkened years, from that lost Paradise!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        BEHIND THE MASK
                        
                            THERE was a man who seemed immune from care,
                            In whom most laughter natively abide;
                            Yet underneath his jests Iay dark despair--
                            The merry man was sorrowful inside.
                        
                        
                            Such is the way of Life's strange masquerade,--
                            Our inner selves few ever learn to know;
                            Ah, could our guarded secrets be betrayed,
                            What unguessed truths would the betrayal show!
                        
                        
                            So with this man, to whom life seemed a jest,
                            Where pleasure ruled supreme and undenied,
                            While in his heart Grief lingered, unconfessed--
                            The merry man was sorrowful inside.
                        
                        
                            For seldom is it given to mortal eyes
                            The inmost shrines of human souls to see--
                            Our heart of hearts we shroud in deep disguise,
                            And wrap our hidden selves in mystery.
                        
                        
                            We cannot know that underneath his cheer
                            The agonies of Failure ever hide,
                            Nor see the might-have-beens whose taunting leer
                            Have made his heart thus sorrowful inside.
                        
                        
                            The gifts of Youth were spent in wanton waste,
                            And one by one he lost the golden years--
                            The vanished joys leave but a bitter taste,
                            And hidden by his smiles are scalding tears.
                        
                        
                        
                            Yet do I hold his life not holly lost,
                            For Failure bravely met is glorified--
                            The lesson of your life is porth the cost,
                            0 merry man--grown sorrowful inside!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SHEET LIGHTNING PEOPLE
                        
                            I KNOW a maid who plays and sings divinely,
                            And draws and paints with an artistic hand;
                            While she does many things I sit supinely,
                            Dazed by her varied gifts, you understand.
                            And yet at times I think this wondrous woman
                            Is like sheet lightning--brilliant, we admit--
                            Whose silver flames the summer skies illumine,
                            And yet--sheet lightning never makes a hit.
                        
                        
                            I know a man whose gifts might make him master
                            Of any one of many noble arts,
                            His varied talents led him to disaster,
                            We see him fail with sorrow in our hearts.
                            Thus is it true that no sheet lightning mortal,
                            Howe'er endowed with genius and with wit,
                            Shall ever enter Fame's enduring portal--
                            Sheet lightning never yet has made a hit.
                        
                        
                            We see unnumbered wrongs we know need righting,
                            Wrongs that bear fruit in endless human woes,
                            And seek to end them by haphazard fighting,
                            And strike them blindly with our scattered blows;
                            But Evil laughs at such sheet lightning warring
                            It fears the bolt that cleaves the heart of it,
                            But warfare such as this must fail of scoring--
                            Sheet lightning never yet has made a hit.
                        
                        
                            We scorn the narrow vision of our brother
                            And visit him with censure plain and frank,
                            
                            Who holds one vital truth and heeds no other,
                            And in disdain give him the title, "Crank";
                            And yet by such the world is upward driven,
                            By such the lamps of progress have been lit--
                            While thunderbolts uncounted trees have riven,
                            Sheet lightning never yet has made a hit.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        DISTANCE LENDS ENCHANTMENT
                        
                            IT would touch your heart to see in what peace
                            and amity
                            All my loving wife's relations and her husband
                            will agree;
                            Though our quarrels are but few, long ago we
                            found it true,
                            As the adage tells us, "Distance lends enchant-
                            ment to the view,"
                            So at least of all the trials that destroy my happy
                            smiles
                            Is the fact that 'twixt my home and theirs lie
                            many, many miles.
                            Oh, our love will pass at par--
                            From afar, from afar!
                        
                        
                            Our devotion never fails--while carried through
                            the mails,
                            But mention living nearer and my valiant visage
                            pales;
                            While we go our separate ways, you will find above
                            all praise
                            The respect that to her family your humble
                            servant pays;
                            Still--I married just my wife and I fear there
                            might be strife
                            Were not this separation the salvation of my life.
                            Oh, our love will pass at par--
                            From afar, from afar!
                        
                        
                        
                            I declare you never saw such a model son-in-law;
                            At a hundred miles' perspective I appear without
                            a flaw
                            But it cannot be denied by the miles that us divide
                            Our mutual admiration is immensely multiplied;
                            And it's furthermore a fact, if those miles you
                            should subtract,
                            It might add a few dissensions that we hitherto
                            have lacked.
                            Oh, our love will pass at par--
                            From afar, from afar.
                        
                        
                            So I drop a mournful tear when they end their
                            visits here,
                            But the weeping might be greater were it other-
                            wise, I fear.
                            I neglected once or twice to give heed to their
                            advice,
                            And lived for days thereafter in an atmosphere
                            of ice;
                            And, per contra, like as not if I told them what I
                            >thought,
                            I would find that my existence was uncomfortably
                            hot.
                            Oh, our love will pass at par--
                            From afar, from afar!
                        
                        
                            Now they never fail to claim every virtue you may
                            name
                            And discover in our children from their family
                            somehow came,
                            
                            While every naughty trait, you will find as sure as
                            fate,
                            From me, their loving father, they inherit, plain
                            and straight;
                            Then my worldly wealth is such that my pride it
                            seems to touch
                            To hear hints I might have managed so I'd now
                            have twice as much.
                            Oh our love will pass at par--
                            From afar, from afar!
                        
                        
                            When you make your nuptial vows and take your-
                            self a spouse,
                            Go off some little distance to select your little
                            house;
                            If your peace of mind is dear, do not make your
                            home too near
                            To either of your families--you'll reget it many
                            a year
                            For this little song of mine may be taken, every
                            line,
                            As a beacon light of wisdom--on your pathway
                            let it shine.
                            And your love will pass at par--
                            From afar, from afar!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        ZEROS
                        
                            THERE are times when I grow sad,
                            Thinking of the little tad
                            Who once learned to count and add,
                            And was taught
                            That the cipher, large and round,
                            With its name's imposing sound,
                            You invariably found 
                            Equaled 0.
                        
                        
                            In those days, with hook and line,
                            When the fishing had been fine,
                            There'd be maybe eight or nine
                            Fishes caught;
                            But we'd mutilate the truth
                            In those joyous days of youth,
                            When our total catch, forsooth,
                            Equaled 0.
                        
                        
                            And I still recall the year--
                            I was naughty then, I fear,
                            For the only thing that dear
                            Santa brought
                            In my socks from tops to toes
                            Were some articles like clothes,
                            Which to my mind, goodness knows,
                            Equaled 0.
                        
                        
                            Now my childhood's left behind,
                            And I muse upon mankind,
                            
                            And the poorest sort I find
                            In the lot
                            Are the ones in whom no sin
                            Could find room to enter in--
                            All they will be or have been
                            Equals 0.
                        
                        
                            There are some we might rehearse
                            Who are bad--and some are worse;
                            They assuredly are a curse
                            To be fought;
                            But deliver us from those
                            Who have neither faults nor foes--
                            All they are, as I suppose,
                            Equals 0.
                        
                        
                            There are some of gentle sex
                            Who man's wisdom do perplex--
                            Let's denominate them X
                            On the spot;
                            They are quantities unknown,
                            But we love them all, we own,
                            Even those who, we are shown,
                            Equal 0.
                        
                        
                            You, my child, be good or bad,
                            Be of merry mind or sad,
                            Oh, be rational or mad
                            And distraught;
                            But whatever else you do,
                            Be it never said of you
                            
                            All you did when you were through
                            Equaled 0
                        
                        
                            Though you never gain success
                            Or the goal for which you press,
                            Though all things you gain be less
                            Than you sought;
                            Not mere winning of the prize,
                            In the judgment of the wise,
                            Marks you not of those whose size
                            Equals 0.
                        
                        
                            Much, at best, that we achieve,
                            Many tangled webs we weave,
                            We in future shall perceive
                            Come to naught;
                            For the wisest of all kings
                            Found that vain are earthly things,
                            That the joy, existence brings
                            Equaled 0.
                        
                        
                            What are all the zeros for?
                            Though we ask it o'er and o'er,
                            'Tis a mystery more and more
                            Deeply fraught,
                            Evil may be understood
                            As the shadow cast by good,
                            Though we'd make it, if we could,
                            Equal 0.
                        
                        
                            But although from age to age
                            Patiently have seer and sage
                            
                            Gathered wisdom, page by page,
                            Dearly bought;
                            Still our knowledge of the Past,
                             Or the Future, looming vast,
                            Weighed and measured at the last
                            Equals 0.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        TRUMPS
                        
                            l LOVE to see a little child
                            By worldly stains all undefiled,
                            And so with joy my spirit jumps
                            To hail the time when "hearts are trumps."
                        
                        
                            But later on, turn where we may,
                            Life is a battle and affray,
                            Where we must meet with many bumps
                            And where, I fear, now "clubs are trumps."
                        
                        
                            If in our struggles, afterwhile,
                            Perchance shall fickle fortune smile,
                            Then shall the jewels bloom in clumps,
                            And pride shall swell, with "diamonds trumps."
                        
                        
                            This, too, alas, shall soon pass by,
                            Since earthly things must fade and die;
                            Then comes the solemn thud of lumps
                            Of "earth to earth"--and "spades are
                                trumps!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        BETWEEN THE LINES 
                        
                            THE gracious gift is given alike to each
                            To glean the meaning from our common speech;
                            The bare, blank import of our timeworn words
                            Comes to uesfreely, as the songs to birds,--
                            But few are given the power to read the mines
                            Of mystic meaning, writ between the lines.
                        
                        
                            The hackneyed words our lips or pens may join,
                            Though in themselves as dull as common coin,
                            Yet, in our use, to seeing hearts may show
                            Truths we may think are hidden far below,
                            And meanness stares at us, or virtue shines--
                            Unwittingly revealed between the lines.
                        
                        
                            For, lo, the words themselves are not the whole--
                            They are the outward form, but not the soul,
                            Whose spirit must escape the dullard's eyes,
                            A godlike gift meant only for the wise,
                            Who from the grapes of language draw the wines
                            Of the diviner thought--between the lines!
                        
                        
                            So the solutions we an direly need
                            The thoughtless throng may hold who runs may
                            read;
                            The outward answers may indeed be plain,
                            So those who seek shall never search in vain--
                            But fruitlessly we seek the Delphic Shrines,--
                            Life's deeper secrete lie between the lines.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
                        
                            HE builded him a dwelling, strong and high,
                            And thought, "So wel and stanchly will I build
                            That the corroding years shall pass it by,
                            And it shall stand when long my hand is stilled."
                        
                        
                            Then in the earth nearby, with careless hand,
                            In idle hour, as we may well suppose--
                            No thought of the far future wisely planned--
                            He planted just a little fragile rose.
                        
                        
                            But Time dealt harshly with that dwelling place,
                            And in the end has brought its utter doom,
                            And now has left behind no faintest trace,
                            Save where a few neglected roses bloom.
                        
                        
                            So in our lives the deeds we hope will last
                            Perhaps shall thus pass utterly away,
                            And nothing shall survive the dying Past
                            But things we thought were of the passing day.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE HOODO DAYS
                        
                        
                            TO-DAY all things I undertook went crisscross
                                and
                            >awry,
                            With not a gleam of heaven's blue or sunshine in
                            the sky;
                            All I have done from dawn to dusk has seemed to
                            end amiss,
                            And so as darkness falls, tonight, I feel about
                            like this!
                        
                        
                            I mind me, even as a child, how some days hap-
                            pened so,
                            An awful blur of gloom and tears, of heartaches
                            and of woe;
                            Then, in the evening, brother Will would say, "I
                            tell you, sis,
                            It seems to me that all day long you've been about
                            like this!"
                        
                        
                            I trow it has been ever so, that since the Fall of
                            Man
                            Such days have crossed his path on earth and
                            tripped him as he ran,
                            And even the haloed saints and seers, and
                            prophets, too, I wis,
                            Have had, at times, a day or so when things went
                            just
                            like this.
                        
                        
                        
                            So, dearest, come to me, tonight, and smooth my
                            silver hair,
                            And let us knit, as poets say, " the ravelled sleeve
                            of care":
                            Let us lay by this careworn day, and end it with
                            a kiss,
                            And pray another will not soon occur that's just
                            like this!
                        
                        
                            For when the hour-glass of our life has spilled
                            its shining sands,
                            And in the last, long sleep we fold our worn and
                            weary hands,
                            Then may we in our Father's house find never end-
                            ing bliss,
                            Nor meet an angel in the throng who feels at all
                            like this.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHY?
                        "WHY?" asks the little child, whose
                            wond'ring
                        eyes
                        The mystery of its new found world defies,
                        Its elders' wisdom putting to the test,
                        To find it but a shallow thing, at best--
                        With wide-eyed wonder, boundless as the sky,
                        And the eternal questions, "how?" and
                            "why?"
                        "Why?" asks the man of science, worn and old,
                        Yet with the long sought answer still untold;
                        He finds some truths to tireless search revealed,
                         But all the rest in age-old darkness sealed--
                        Unto the wisest, as to you and I,
                        Still come the baffling questions, "how?" and
                        "why?"
                        "Why?" asks the thinker who has pondered long
                        Over the endless struggle, Right with Wrong,--
                        He who has looked on Life, and seen therein
                        How strangely mixed are righteousness and sin,
                        And all the heights and depths that in it lie--
                        Well may his saddened spirit question, "why?"
                        "Why?" asks again the lover of his kind,
                        Must wealth parade and hunger march behind?
                        Why is man's lot in life divided thus,
                        Unchanged, from the far past of Lazarus?
                        Equal, at last, each waits his hour to die,
                        Perhaps to know the long sought reason "why."
                        
                        " Why?" ask the prophets of the human soul,
                        Who seek from the Unknown the veil to roll--
                        Who breathed the breath of life in on dull clod?
                        In vain--" Canst thou by seeking find out God "
                        Eternity alone may make reply
                        To our impatient, unavailing, " why? "
                        Nay, little sweetheart, with the wond'ring eyes,
                        Not all the wisdom of the wisest wise,
                        Nor all the knowledge of the ages past
                        Can answer half your questionings, at last;
                        We seek in vain the truths for which you sigh,
                        While from the great Unknown is echoed, " why? "
                    
                    
                    
                        QUARRELS
                        
                            SOMETIMES it seems to happen that the world is
                            full of spite,
                            When it's natural as breathing to quarrel, fuss
                            and fight,
                            And everything we undertake goes every way but
                            right,
                            And tears must flow.
                        
                        
                            The children start a quarrel at every word that's
                            said,
                            And father goes off angry and wishing he were
                            dead,
                            While mother stays and struggles, with an aching
                            heart and head,
                            And all is woe!
                        
                        
                            If a barometer is near, it indicates a storm,
                            And the thermometer will show the temperature is
                            warm,
                            And stinging words of anger like honey bees will
                            swarm,
                            We know not whence.
                        
                        
                            And mother says that her belief--or rather her
                            suspicion--
                            Is that father's cold has settled right in his dis-
                            position,
                            And that she wishes--but she knows that there's
                            no use in wishin'--
                            So why commence?
                        
                        
                        
                            Yet, in truth, these times of anger are but ripples
                            a pool
                            That below is deep and quiet, therefore soon the
                            wrath must cool,
                            And end by all admitting they were acting like a
                            fool,
                            And meant it not.
                        
                        
                            For on Life's jangling journey, if we would love
                            and live,
                            We find the need of spirits that leak anger like
                            sieve,
                            And hearts that can remember to forget and to
                            forgive,
                            And bygones blot!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE PASSING OF THE SLATE
                        
                            MY vagrant mind strays back, tonight,
                            To school days of an earlier date,
                            When all that I would draw or write
                            Appeared upon my old, cracked slate.
                        
                        
                            With knotty sums or scribbled text,
                            Or bits of youthful art thereon,
                            And if the work its author vexed,
                            One smudge--and all of it was gone.
                        
                        
                            The teacher's portrait might appear--
                            If we escaped his watchful eye--
                            To be rubbed out in haste and fear,
                            When the original came by.
                        
                        
                            A thousand things we might discern,
                            The aimless work of idle mind,
                            Each disappearing in its turn
                            And leaving not a trace behind.
                        
                        
                            But now the slate has lost its rule;
                            Today finds paper in its place,
                            And, both in life and in the school,
                            Mistakes are harder to erase.
                        
                        
                            The records of our later years
                            Are full of errors, small and great,
                            That we'd efface with joyful tears,
                            Were they but written on a slate!
                        
                        
                        
                            And full of words best left unsaid,
                            That make our brother's spirit bleed;
                            Stones given to him who asked for bread
                            And mocking thus his utter need.
                        
                        
                            We know all things are wisely planned,
                            So let us quarrel not with Fate
                            That we the power may not command
                            Of wiping bygones From Life's slate.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        BLOTS
                        
                            ONLY an inkspot, idly spilled upon the virgin
                                page,
                            Yet no man's hand, however skilled, nor touch of
                            mellow age
                            Shall ever more remove the trace of the offending
                            spot,
                            Or ever utterly efface the little, hateful blot.
                        
                        
                            So in our lives, as journeying on, we pass the
                            fleeting years,
                            There's many a page that's stained upon, and
                            neither time nor tears,
                            Nor aught the future holds in store can ever take
                            away
                            The smirch that recollection sore sees on that by-
                            gone day!
                        
                        
                            But though to cleanse the past in vain we stretch
                            our helpless hand.,
                            The future lies without a stain; so may I break
                            the bands
                            That bind me to the blotted past, and claim that
                            future mine,
                            That it may brighten to the last with gleams of
                            the Divine!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        IT PAYS TO ADVERTISE
                        
                            WE love to praise the modest flower
                            That blooms unseen in hidden bower,
                            But flaunting blossoms catch our eyes,
                            For, lo, it pays to advertise.
                        
                        
                            We all admire the modest maid,
                            In simple, quiet dress arrayed--
                            Such often miss connubial ties,
                            Because it pays to advertise.
                        
                        
                            Some "ragtime" songs, you'll please take
                                note,
                            Earn more than all that Shakespeare wrote--
                            The golden harvest blinds our eyes,
                            And proven it pays to advertise.
                        
                        
                            "The preacher" truly was not wrong,
                            The battle isn't to the strong,
                            And "neither yet bread to the wise"--
                            He knew it paid to advertise.
                        
                        
                            Full-fed Success delights to flaunt
                            Before the envious eyes of Want--
                            Success denotes the truly wise,
                            And shows it pays to advertise.
                        
                        
                            We sing the praises of the poor;
                            For their distress our aid is sure;
                            Sweet Charity from housetops cries
                            Behold it pays to advertise.
                        
                        
                        
                            From Him Who bade us veil from sight
                            The left hand's good deeds from the right
                            We turn-the Father of all Lies
                            Knows well it pays to advertise.
                        
                        
                            We read the graven epitaph
                            Above forgotten dust, and laugh,
                            For whether mortal lives or dies,
                            He knows it pays to advertise.
                        
                        
                            We sing the praise of modest worth,
                            While egotists acquire the earth;
                            To such it is a lawful prize--
                            Their creed: It pays to advertise.
                        
                        
                            Then bow before the Golden Calf,
                            You who have grown too wise by half
                            To eat the bread of sarifice--
                            Instead, it pays to advertise.
                        
                        
                            The world is busy with its cares,
                            Nor looks beyond its own affairs,
                            And hence it is without surprise
                            We find it pays to advertise.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        MODEL PEOPLE
                        
                            THERE'S a boy who never lies,
                            Never steals his mother's pies,
                            But as doubtless you surmise--
                            He is dead;
                            Never sneaks away to swim,
                            Never climbs a slender limb;
                            All that's ever wrong with him--
                            He is dead.
                        
                        
                            There's a girl who is not vain,
                            Never gives a playmate pain;
                            From these premises it's plain--
                            She is dead;
                            Never minds the looking glass,
                            Never giggles when I pass,
                            She is faultless--but alas--
                            She is dead.
                        
                        
                            There's a woman, so I hear,
                            Turns to gossip a deaf ear;
                            You may think this passing queer--
                            She is dead;
                            Never utters spiteful things,
                            To the cause of justice clings,
                            But at present she wears wings--
                            She is dead.
                        
                        
                            There's a man who never cheats
                            Any mortal that he meets,
                            
                            But he's wrapped in winding sheets--
                            He is dead;
                            Is not selfish, never tries
                            To hog up the choicest prize,
                            But I own with saddest sighs--
                            He is dead.
                        
                        
                            You have often read, perchance,
                            Of the heroes of romance;
                            Reason tells you at a glance--
                            They are dead;
                            They are folks of noble mind,
                            Made of all good traits combined,
                            So I sorrow when I find--
                            They are dead.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HIS SWEET TEMPERED WIFE
                        
                            AN even temper should he held a pearl above
                                all
                            price,
                            And outbursts of unbridled wrath are always far
                            from nice,
                            Especially in womankind, and therefore what a
                            treat
                            Is given him who has a wife whose temper's always
                            sweet!
                        
                        
                            The neighbors marvel, one and all, at her angelic
                            ways;
                            Her calm, unruffled frame of mind they never cease
                            to praise;
                            Why should her husband, then, complain of food
                            he cannot eat--
                            The heartless brute who has a wife whose temper's
                            always sweet.
                        
                        
                            We must admit that chaos reigns forever in her
                            house,
                            Her cupboard shelves would drive away a self
                            respecting mouse;
                            But should he growl because his home is never
                            clean and neat--
                            This brutal boor who has the wife whose temper's
                            always sweet?
                        
                        
                            Oh, never be it said of her she willingly would
                            shirk,
                            Still a little irritation is inseparable from
                                work;
                            
                            And so she just avoids them both; his joy
                                should
                            be complete--
                            Thrice blessed man who has a wife whose temper's
                            always sweet!
                        
                        
                            Her husband meets his daily round of labor, strife
                            and care,
                            And I fear his disposition sometimes shows some
                            signs of wear,
                            Yet with a bright and cheery smile she never fails
                            to greet
                            This favored man who has a wife whose temper's
                            always sweet.
                        
                        
                            What if her children should be cross--she sends
                            them off to play
                            With some near neighbor's little folks--it's
                                such
                            an easy way;
                            She would not think of chiding them for playing
                            on the street--
                            O happy father with a wife whose temper is so
                            sweet!
                        
                        
                            What though her shiftless management he daily
                            finds to be
                            A burden such as was the lot of Sindbad of the
                            Sea;
                            What though he finds his life thereby foredoomed
                            to sure defeat;
                            Should he not thank his lucky stars her temper
                            is so sweet?
                        
                        
                        
                            His sins are large and many but his pathways are
                            so rough
                            That we trust they may be pardoned--he's been
                            punished quite enough;
                            So we trust the Gates of Peter shall admit his
                            faltering feet--
                            The sinful man who had a wife whose temper was
                            so sweet.
                        
                        
                            So I'll not feel stunned or startled if, when first
                            my dazzled eyes
                            Catch a gleaming glimpse of glory through the
                            Gates of Paradise,
                            I behold enthroned in triumph on the very choicest
                            seat
                            The man who had the wife on earth whose temper
                            was so sweet!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HER EASTER THOUGHTS
                        
                            SHE sat demurely in the choir;
                            Her face seemed lit with sacred fire,
                            And as she sang I seemed to hear
                            Angelic voices, sweet and clear.
                        
                        
                            And as she sang I prayed that I
                            Be given power, from on High,
                            To read the thoughts that seemed to raise
                            Her rapturous soul in songs of praise.
                        
                        
                            Then Providence the gift bestowed,
                            And as the heavenly music flowed,
                            The inmost secrets of her mind
                            Were given me--and I repined!
                        
                        
                            She sang: "My Father knows my need;
                            And I can trust His love;
                            He may not always deign to give me
                            The things which most I crave."
                        
                        
                            She thought: "Gee! How I wish mygowns
                            Were half as swell as Cynthy Brown's,
                            And Mrs. Jones--the hateful cat--
                            Has got a stunning Easter hat!""
                        
                        
                            She sang: "My Father knows my need;
                            He will supply it all;
                            He hears His children when they cry,
                            And he answers when they call."
                        
                        
                        
                            She thought: "Now there's Malindy
                                Stan
                            Has got herself another beau;
                            I wouldn't think it could be true--
                            But he's a-settin' in their pew!"
                        
                        
                            She sang: "My Father knows my need;
                            His love no tongue can tell;
                            And if sometimes He does deny me,
                            I know for me 'tis well."
                        
                        
                            She thought: " Sue Thompson's
                                latest dress
                            Was never made for her, I guess;
                            Her rich relations' cast-off clothes
                            She thinks are pretty swell, I s'pose!"
                        
                        
                            She sang: "My Father know my need;
                            I fear no dread alarms,
                            For round about and underneath me
                            Are Everlasting arms."
                        
                        
                            She thought: "Look there at Becky
                                Brush--
                            She and her beau are soft as mush;
                            She's giggling there behind her fan,
                            Stuck up because she's got a man!"
                        
                        
                            She sang: "My Father knows,
                            . . . Oh, yes, He knows,
                            And with my soul 'tis well."
                        
                        
                            Thought I, fair maid, it may be so,
                            I'm very sure I do not know;
                            
                            And if I knew great deal less
                            I'd like it better, I confess.
                        
                        
                            Then I to Providence did pray
                            To take that fatal gift away;
                            I never wish to pierce the screen
                            That leaves our inner thoughts unseen.
                        
                        
                            Nay, from that hour I daily ask
                            That no X-ray shall e'er unmask
                            The hidden thoughts of mortal mind,
                            And if it should--then strike me
                                    blind!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE OLD-FASHIONED GRANDMOTHER
                        
                            THERE is something calm and holy in her quiet,
                            >furrowed face,
                            On which many bygone sorrows have left their
                            lasting trace,
                            But their passing has not left her in either face
                            or mind
                            Anything but present sweetness, with no bitter-
                            ness behind.
                        
                        
                            We may smile, perhaps, a moment at her queer
                            old Quaker cap,
                            As, beneath her clicking needles, grows the mitten
                            in her lap;
                            And again, no doubt, while gazing on the slender
                            paper rolls,
                            Made to light the evening candles of those frugal
                            old-time souls.
                        
                        
                            But she gave us strings of empty spools--a
                            treasure, you'll allow,
                            And queer old-fashioned pennies, as large as
                            quarters, now;
                            And let us run her spinning wheel and snuff the
                            candle, too,
                            And when she spoke, said "thee" and
                                "thy,"
                            instead of "your" and
                                "you."
                        
                        
                        
                            She knows the old privations have forevermore
                            gone by,
                            While a spendthrift generation complains that
                            living's high,
                            And lives in loving memories of a simpler, slower
                            past,
                            When men's wants were not so boundless and their
                            pace was not so fast.
                        
                        
                            She knows the rapid current of the years turns
                            never back,
                            But brings new compensations for the things that
                            it may lack;
                            Yet I doubt not there are moments when her gentle
                            soul regrets
                            The coming of the present, with its wealth and
                            suffragettes.
                        
                        
                            O maidens of the present, when the years have
                            come and gone
                            And brought you to the ending of the paths you're
                            travelling on,
                            May we find you all as worthy of our reverence,
                            at last,
                            O Grandmas of the Future, as these Grandmas of
                            the Past!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        INTRODUCIN' BOOMVILLE 
                        
                            You needn't look for Boomville on the general run
                            of maps,
                            It's not a full sized city, so it won't be there,
                                per-
                            haps;
                            But a map that deals in detail with our good old
                            Hoosier State
                            Will show the town of Boomville--or it should,
                            at any rate.
                        
                        
                            You've often seen some little boy pretending'
                                he's
                            a man,
                            And actin' big and dignified and grown-up" as
                            he can;
                            Well, Boomville's that way, and if she could just
                            increase in girth
                            By trying' to be big, she'd be metropolis of
                                the
                            earth.
                        
                        
                            We claim a thousand people, though some jealous
                            towns deride,
                            And hint that from the census man the half of
                            them most hide;
                            Or if we claim a " thousand souls," these
                                scornful
                            folks amuse
                            Themselves by sayin' that the "souls" are
                                mostly
                            soles of shoes!
                        
                        
                        
                            We have a half a dozen stores, a pair of barber
                            shops,
                            A railroad, too, with lots of trains, and now and
                            then one stops;
                            We have an elevator and a moving picture show,
                            A High School and a saw mill and three churches
                            in a row.
                        
                        
                            We've many social doings: there's the Boomville
                            Ladies' Aid,
                            Without which all our churches would be bank-
                            rupt, I'm afraid;
                            We've the Daughters of Rebekah--called the
                            "Beckys,"~ just for short--
                            And seven other Lodges of every style and sort.
                        
                        
                            We're neighborly in Boomville, and everyone's
                            affairs
                            Are sort of public property-we take 'em on the
                            shares;
                            And this is pleasant, too--sometimes--for
                            when we meet disgrace
                            We wish that it were otherwise, and hide our luck-
                            less face.
                        
                        
                            When strangers come to Boomville, the interest
                            is intense,
                            Who they may be and when they came and also
                            why and whence;
                            And when we once discover news, the way it's
                            magnified
                            
                            Would make a compound microscope lose all its
                            proper pride.
                        
                        
                            So if you seek for Boonville, though it's missing
                            on the map,
                            It's here in Indiana, in Nature's lavish lap,
                            And has a population of a thousand--more or
                            less--
                            And is the finest town on earth as we ourselves
                            confess.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE LEISURE CLASS IN BOOMVILLE
                        
                            I NOTE some foreign critic says there is no
                                "leisure
                            class "
                            In this uncultured country of the free,
                            But I desire to say to him, I'd like for him to pass
                            Around among our Boomvillsites with me!
                        
                        
                            I'd point him out a "leisure class" at
                                Grayson's
                            grocery store,
                            And others at Bill Barber's blacksmith shop;
                            At Hank O'Brien's shoe shop there are always
                            several more--
                            Why, you'll find 'emr half the places that you
                                stop.
                        
                        
                            They sit in Grayson's grocery store and chew
                            and smoke and chew,
                            In an atmosphere that turns a stranger green;
                            You find the articles of food the clerk bands out
                            to you
                            Are flavored, one and all, with nicotine!
                        
                        
                            A few in Barber's blacksmith shop will always take
                            their rest;
                            Bill punctuates the talk with hammer blows--
                            To watch another working gives a loafer added
                            zest,
                            And doubles his enjoyment of repose.
                        
                        
                            They gather at O'Brien's and watch him cobble
                            shoes
                            While they assassinate Old Father Time,
                            
                            Debatin' about politics, disseminatin' news,
                            Or talkin' of the latest noted crime.
                        
                        
                            Or, in the pleasant summer time, they'll sit along
                            the walk
                            And chaff and joke their neighbors as they pass,
                            Discuss the President's mistakes and talk and talk
                            and TALK
                            O my dear foreign friend--"no leisure class!"
                        
                        
                            "No leisure class!" It may be true we're
                                short
                            of titled lords
                            With damp and moldy castles and a yacht;
                            But we've a leisure class, my friend,--you'll
                                find
                            them whittling boards,
                            And at checkers they are Johnny-on-the-spot!
                        
                        
                            You'll find 'em at the harness shop,
                                you'll find 'em
                            at the Bank,
                            At the hardware, sitting throned on kegs of nails;
                            Where some new building's going up they orna-
                            ment a plank,
                            And they gather in en masse at "Public Sales."
                        
                        
                            Then, too, we often entertain the migratory kind,
                            Whose wealth has been destroyed by fire and food,
                            And who, to trust appearances, are crippled, lame
                            or blind--
                            These are our "leisure " princes of the blood.
                        
                        
                        
                            We must admit that Boomville lacks "the glory
                            that was Greece "
                            In some things Rome and Paris may surpass,
                            And we've no titles, you might say, but Justice of
                            the Peace,--
                            But don't tell us we have "no leisure
                                class!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BOOMVILLE BANNER
                        
                            OF the famous Boomville Banner I now propose
                            to speak,--
                            A journalistic triumph occurring once a week;
                            All Boomville reads it through and through, as we
                            delight to state--
                            Four pages filled with Boomville news and four
                            with "boiler-plate."
                        
                        
                            We learn that Sam Smith lost a horse and Jim
                            Jones found a cow,
                            And that Bill Barber's new front porch is almost
                            finished now;
                            We learn the Perkins family took dinner with Sim
                            Steele--
                            This important news concluding with a tribute to
                            the meal!
                        
                        
                            We read that Mrs. Smithers brought the editor
                            a pie,
                            And Mrs. Stump some apples that were "apples
                            of his eye";
                            For the finest, fairest products of all the country
                            'round
                            In the Boomville Banner sanctum are invariably
                            found.
                        
                        
                            They bring in home-made sausages, they bring in
                            fruit and flowers,
                            And "garden sass" and cottage cheese and
                            rhubarb wine in showers--
                            
                            Such gifts betoken generous hearts, for who could
                            basely hint
                            They might be prompted by desire to see one's
                            name in print!
                        
                        
                            "Our Country Correspondence" fills the last
                            page to a dot,
                            The news from Ginger Center, Jericho and Possum
                            Trot,
                            From Panama and Summit Hill, Highridge and
                            Galilee--
                            For which each correspondent receives his Banner
                            free.
                        
                        
                            The Banner has its enemies, but none of them
                            deny
                            Its gift for hiding ugly truths in a euphemistic
                            lie;
                            Thus when the Banner says "resigned" the
                                word's
                            interpreted
                            As meaning, nine times out of ten, some one was
                            "fired" instead.
                        
                        
                            I say it has its enemies: some criticize its stuff
                            As too much this or too much that, or maybe not
                            enough;
                            And once a teacher from the east remarked its
                            columns each
                            Appeared to her like hospitals for mangled parts
                            of speech!
                        
                        
                        
                            Its sentences she could not parse, she said, to save
                            her life
                            (Fact is, the Banner's English isn't quite like
                            CÃ¦sar's wife) ;
                            And then she'd poke no end of fun at its unceasing
                            love
                            Forending half its sentences with "to" or
                                "for"
                            or "of."
                        
                        
                            Still, the Banner stands for Boomville--speak
                            not of it in scorn;
                            It chronicles our history from the hour when we
                            are born,
                            And when we end life's journey our obituaries
                            shine--
                            They only cost a dollar each (verse five cents to
                            the line).
                        
                        
                            So let the city papers count their readers in a
                            host;
                            Perhaps they may be larger, but the Banner's
                            read the most;
                            At its items or its grammar though our enemies
                            deride,
                            Yet each subscriber points to it with unabated
                            pride.

                                        doth relate,
                                
                                
                                    The which hath served to save him from an
                                        untimely
                                
                                
                                    fate.

                                It fares not so with Wilfred, y-clept the Bold.
                                How then did he, a prisoner, escape
                                The direful end his predecessors found?
                                He hath a comely face and knightly shape,
                            
                            
                            And noble bearing, as of lord or king,
                            So in the Castle tower, large and round,
                            He was confined to ever wail and sing.

                                        pause
                                
                                
                                    To give an opportunity for well deserved
                                        applause.

                                His lovely daughter, in her chamber old,
                                And eke Sir Wilfred, in his dungeon cold,
                                Have whiled away the night, and now the gray
                                And misty dawn foretells the coming day.

                                    The Poet here retires to a point removed from
                                        harm,
                                
                                
                                    For a herald of the enemy hath sounded an
                                        alarm.
                                
                            
                            
                                Hark to the herald's horn before the gate;
                                Behold the spears, as in array they glisten!
                                Don Bumbos heedeth not except to state:
                                "Let the fools blow, I do not deign to
                                    listen!"

                                    Contains the sad emotions of Sir Wilfred,
                                        surnamed
                                
                                
                                    Bold,
                                
                                
                                    As from his lofty prison he the strangers doth
                                        behold.
                                
                            
                            
                                Sir Wilfred in his lonely dungeon tower,
                                Heareth the trumpet call, and peereth out
                                To see who comes at such unseemly hour.
                                He wotteth well the cause of the attack;
                                
                                Another knight hath come on and about
                                Affairs of love--with mighty joy he turneth
                                back:
                                He, too, the way of all shall shortly go,
                                But should he win, oh, woe the day, alack!"
                                By jealousy o'ercome he falleth low,
                                And tears his hair in unavailing woe.
                            
                        
                        
                            BOOK IX
                            
                                
                                    The Poet now the bloody strife beoldeth from
                                        afar,
                                
                                
                                    And then eftsoones goes on to state the outcome of
                                        the
                                
                                
                                    war.
                                
                            
                            
                                Now do we hear the heavy armor rattle,
                                And clashing spears upon the field of battle--
                                But, well-a-day, need I prolong the tale,
                                When mightier bards have sung of combats gory?
                                The powers of pen and ink too soon would fail,
                                So I proceed with this most mournful story.
                                Suffice to say the lovelorn knights were captured,
                                And in some future years, gadzooks, I ween,
                                Their last remains would make just such a scene
                                As, some time ago, I declined to show
                                To my hearers so enraptured!
                            
                        
                        
                            BOOK X
                            
                                
                                    The Poet here relateth how the red and ruddy
                                        wine
                                
                                
                                    The powers of the soldiery doth sadly
                                        undermine.
                                
                            
                            
                                Don Bumbos stalks through his ancestral halls,
                                Through the capacious halls of Bumbos Castle;
                                While one by one each gallant soldier falls,
                                
                                Not from his wounds, but from the wine and
                                wassail
                                Don Bumbos the Superb gives to his yeomen,
                                When they have bravely vanquished all their foe-
                                men.

                                    The Poet here beholdeth another fierce attack,
                                
                                
                                    While every armored soldier lies snoring on his
                                        back.
                                
                            
                            
                                But harkt! A herald's trumpet sounds again
                                Before the mighty walls of Bumbos Castle--
                                Who will defend it now? Its garrison,
                                As I have said, are overcome by wassail;
                                Don Bumbos only hath his head--and rues it,
                                When he bethinks he is so like to lose it!
                            
                        
                        
                            BOOK XII
                            
                                The herald' proclamation the Poet doth
                                        reveal,
                                
                                    Then to a distance he retires to wait the clash of
                                        steel.
                                
                            
                            The herald forth doth ride and this proclaims:
                            "We call upon Don Bumbos to surrender
                            This Castle up, by all the glorious names
                            Of Thor and Woden, gods of war and thunder;
                            We are the liegemen of Wilfred the Bold,
                            Who shall this Castle ever have and hold."

                                    To the herald's proclamation Don Bumbos
                                        makes,
                                
                                
                                    reply,
                                
                                
                                    The which would seem to indicate the fur is going
                                        to
                                
                                
                                    fly
                                
                            
                            
                            
                                Then thus replied Don Bumbos the Serene,
                                Saying; "'A thousand mightier hosts
                                    I've routed;
                                Above them all the grass grows tall and green;
                                They also of surrender often spouted!"
                                . . . Dear Reader, if in battles you delight,
                                Select your favorite; to this case apply it;
                                I shall but give the ending of the fight,
                                And then proceed upon my tale in quiet.
                                Suffice to say the Castle taken was,
                                And Bold Sir Wilfred soon was liberated,
                                While stern Don Bumbos roughly shaken was--
                                And so the end of this dread combat's stated.

                                    The Poet heaves a sigh or two for
                                        yesterday's mis-

                                    Then tuns his harp to sing a lay of love and
                                        of
                                
                                
                                    romance.
                                
                            
                            
                                And as for that sweet Lady, Ethelyn,
                                Who can describe her mingled joy and sorrow?
                                She tells Sir Wilfred how she tried to win
                                His freedom and--ah well, they wed tomorrow!

                                    The Poet now, in such a way that none it may
                                        offend,
                                
                                
                                    Lets fall a gentle hint or two of stern Don
                                        Bumbos'
                                
                                end.
                            
                            
                                The question now Sir Wilfred much doth bother,
                                In what wise he should deal with his new father;
                                He muses much and oft consults his lady;
                                
                                Some his conclusion might think somewhat shady,
                                For--by the shades of Christopher Columbus--
                                It also was the conclusion of Don Bumbos!

                                    The Poet with exceeding joy describes the
                                        wedding

                                    Although, alack, his feeble pen its pomp can not
                                        por-

                                Behold the marriage feasts! Now the procession
                                Starts from the mighty gates of Bumbos Castle;
                                The Evil One and jesters in progression
                                Follow behind and quaff the wine and wassail.
                                All swore no fairer pair had ever been
                                Than Wilfred and his Lady, Ethelyn.
                                The only thing to mar the nuptial feast,--
                                The absence of Don Bumbos--late deceased,
                                The which hath left his daughter brokenhearted,
                                While Wilfred also mourns the dear departed.

                                    The Poet comes at last unto the ending of his
                                        lay,
                                
                                
                                    And puts his silent harp aside until some other
                                        day.
                                
                            
                            
                                Hark to the horns at Bumbos Castle blowing!
                                Quaff of the wine at Bumbos Castle flowing!
                                Sir Wilfred lived in sweet tranquillity--
                                That is, he only fought about five knights a day,
                                And as throughout his life he preyed on merchants,
                                He doubtless died full rich in treasure, perchance.
                                
                                Far famed became his banner as it floated
                                In knightly joust by many a castle moated;
                                But I must lay aside my goose quill facile,
                                And bid a sad farewell to Bumbos Castle!
                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A STONE-AGE CURTAIN LECTURE
                        
                            SHE
                            THEY say our neighbors just across have found
                            the nicest cave--
                            So light and dry, while ours is damp and gloomy
                            as the grave;
                            She came here lately to parade the bearskin dress
                            she wore--
                            Brand new- and I've been wearing mine for
                                forty
                            years or more!
                        
                        
                            HE
                            The cave we've lived in all these years is plenty
                            good enough;
                            The one I went and dragged you from did look
                            a trifle tough;
                            And as regards your bearskin dress, I think, be-
                            yond a doubt,
                            That it would be a sinful waste to fail to wear it
                            out.
                        
                        
                            SHE
                            You know as well as I do that it isn't ft
                                to wear;
                            Some wouldn't wear it here at home, but I must
                            everywhere;
                            And even if it's not worn out, it's out of style,
                                be-
                            cause
                            It's all the fashion, nowadays, to leave on all the
                            claws!
                        
                        
                        
                            HE
                            If you try to follow fashion, you'll find out,
                                I'll
                            be bound,
                            There aren't bears enough on earth for the skins
                            to go around;
                            You'd better wear the one you have and keep it
                            looking neat,
                            And be thankful for your blessings that you have 
                            enough to eat.
                        
                        
                            SHE
                            Yes! But I have always noticed, with the country
                            full of deer,
                            You'll kill some hulking mammoth, and we eat
                            it for a year;
                            But I noticed at the neighbor's, when I visited
                            them there,
                            They'd venison, thesaurus meat and several
                                kinds
                            of bear!
                        
                        
                            HE
                            That's enough of such complaining--if my
                            patience you should tax
                            With your foolish prattle longer I will hit you
                            with my ax;
                            I'm not quick enough for reindeer--that,
                                per-
                            haps, is very true;
                            But, I say without vain boasting, I am quick
                            enough for you!
                        
                        
                        
                            SHE
                            I would like to see you do it--you're afraid to,
                            though, of course;
                            If you dare so much as threaten, there'll soon be
                            a divorce;
                            You wouldn't think of fighting with a bear of half
                            your size,
                            And if you mention fighting me, I'll
                                scratch out
                            both your eyes!
                        
                        
                            MORAL
                            In the Stone Age, as at present, when a quarrel
                            has occurred,
                            We surmise that to the woman there belonged the
                            final word.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE HOBO
                        POOR, unkempt victim of the Wanderlust,
                        Disgraced, despised--a modern Lazarus--
                        Thou, like Ulysses, art "become a name
                        For always roaming with a hungry heart."
                        The watch dog views thee with suspicious eye
                        And surly snarl; the housewife hands thee forth
                        Remnants of last week's breakfast, cast-off clothes
                        Of bygone years, while her more heartless spouse
                        Drops hints of gnarly woodpiles, ax and saw--
                        Speaks of the benefits of exercise
                        And thrusts thee forth in the cold world again.
                        Our modern fresh air faddists have at least
                        Nothing on thee--across thy lowly couch
                        The fresh air filters through the barbwire fence,
                        By the lone straw stack where thou findest rest.
                        Much bast thou travelled, likewise, though the
                        scenes
                        Thou seeest mainly are but flying ties,
                        Red litten switchyards and dark-browed police,
                        And dusty highways, leading on and on
                        Past countless homes, but none to shelter thee.
                        Though well deserved thy sorrows, I doubt not,
                        Yet goes my heart in sympathy to thee,
                        For this I learned while I was yet a child,
                        'Tis easier to slide down an icy hill
                        Than upward climb its slipp'ry slopes again.
                        So when the final summons of thy Judge
                        Bids thee "move on," and quit this vale of tears,
                        I pray the boon thou long bast vainly sought
                        Be thine at last--Eternities of Rest!
                    
                    
                    
                        BUT
                        
                            'TIS sad that as we journey on
                            Through this brief world, so quickly gone,
                            We meet with such unkindly "knocks" 
                            That charity in sorrow mocks.
                            For some will sweetly cast a slur
                            That clingeth like a burdock burr,
                            And makes a palace seem a hut
                            With an occasional timely "but."
                        
                        
                            We praise the virtues of our friends,
                            Our admiration never ends;
                            We build their reputations high
                            As the deep azure of the sky;
                            Inspired by friendship's sacred fire,
                            We ask that all the world admire,
                            And then--their throats we gently cut
                            While ending up our priase with "but."
                        
                        
                            We are so fair that Heaven knows
                            We'd never wrong our foulest foes;
                            We always give the devil his due,
                            With sometimes extra measure, too;
                            And those who wrong us, we admit,
                            We're told to love by Holy Writ;
                            Still--they'll have little cause to strut
                            When we conclude our tale with "but."
                        
                        
                            But when our journey's at an end,
                            And we are done with foe and friend,
                            
                            And every knock and slam and slur
                            Are numbered with the things that were,
                            Perchance we'll stand at Peter's Gate
                            And for admittance boldly wait,
                            Then hear the golden portals shut--
                            "I'd gladly bid you enter . . . 'But'!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        OUR LOST ILLUSIONS
                        
                            IN youth we thought the Ship of State
                            Was manned by statesmen--pardon laughter;
                            We find the blockhead and his mate,
                            The clever grafter.
                        
                        
                            And men who uttered words of light
                            We used to think were surely sainted--
                            But some we find are not as white
                            As they were painted.
                        
                        
                            We thought that we could gain renown,
                            And strove to do it--as who wouldn't?
                            But now, when Fate has turned us down,
                            We find we couldn't!
                        
                        
                            We fondly hoped, in bygone years,
                            To hew our way through walls of granite,
                            But we are haunted now by fears
                            Perhaps we cannot.
                        
                        
                            We thought our heart was all our own,
                            And fancy free--what young man doesn't?
                            But when the fleeting years had flown
                            We found it wasn't.
                        
                        
                            We thought that women were as pure
                            And sweet as pictured in romances;
                            Some are--with others I am sure
                            You take some chances!
                        
                        
                        
                            Of course I know too well, today,
                            These fancies were but vain delusions,
                            And yet for their return I pray--
                            My lost illusions!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                         THE GIRL FOR ME
                        
                            OH, I know little lassie who is so divinely
                                "sassy "
                            That I know she is the only girl for me;
                            She will stamp her foot and order, and I have such
                            feelings toward her
                            That I'd rather be her humble slave than free!
                        
                        
                            For I love this little lassie and I think that's prima
                            
                                facie
                            
                            proof that she must be the only girl for me;
                            And I sometimes sadly wonder what we'd do if torn
                            asunder,
                            So I pray that such a thing may never be!
                        
                        
                            Well I know there's not a lassie between Nome and
                            Tallahassee
                            Can compre with her--the only girl for me;
                            We are so completely mated that it's evidently
                            fated,
                            And that's a fate from which I'll
                                never flee!
                        
                        
                            For to me this little lassie seems so queenly and so
                            "classy "
                            That it's settled she's the only girl for me;
                            And no joy could be sweeter and no happiness com-
                            pleter--
                            She's just locked my heart and thrown away the
                            key!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        REST IN PEACE
                        
                            THE years roll by, unbroken in their flow,
                            Bringing the longing that must stronger grow,
                            That earthly cares may find their sweet release
                            In earth's great bosom, there to rest in peace.
                        
                        
                            From fickle Fortune comes blow and comes caress,
                            But no man knoweth if she shall curse or bless--
                            There is no haven from her vain caprice,
                            No certain refuge, till we rest in peace.
                        
                        
                            Why then in sorrow and in bitter grief
                            Are we complaining that this life is brief?
                            An all-wise Mercy made thus short its lease,
                            That in its closing we may rest in peace.
                        
                        
                            Wayworn and weary, we shall sow and reap;
                            At last "He giveth his beloved sleep ";
                            So, as the burdens of the years increase,
                            Mourn not their passing--we shall rest in peace.
                        
                        
                            In hours of trial must the way seem long,
                            Full of vain striving of the right with wrong;
                            That is Eternal--ours is sweet release:
                            Our labor ended, we shall rest in peace!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE POET AND HIS ART
                        
                            WHAT is the poet's gift,
                            What gives him power to lift
                            The overhanging clouds away and show the shining
                            rift?
                            'Tis not in jingling rhymes
                            Or words whose music chimes--
                            It is his power to banish clay and dwell in spirit
                            climes.
                        
                        
                            Whence come his melodies?
                            The murmur of the bees,
                            The measured sighing of the wind among the
                            swaying trees
                            He borrows, one and all,
                            With cadences that call
                            Forevermore from ocean shore and plashing water-
                            fall.
                        
                        
                            What of the poet's heart?
                            For all his magic art,
                            Yet do we find in all mankind its like and counter-
                            part;
                            But he, alone, may dare
                            To lay its secrets bare,
                            And shadow forth the harmonies he finds abiding
                            there.
                        
                        
                            What sees the poet's eye
                            That all may not descry?
                            
                            Perchance, the teardrops on his lids have rain-
                             bowed all the sky;
                            What music meets his ear
                            That others may not hear?
                            None, save that in his soul sometimes it wakes an
                            echo clear.
                        
                        
                            What is the poet's choice?
                            Only to be the voice
                            That speaketh for the voiceless, when they mourn
                            or they rejoice.
                            I hold him direly wrong
                            Who holds the poet's song--
                            Though of his heart it be a part--to him can all
                            belong.
                        
                        
                            What then is his reward,
                            Who thus hath freely poured
                            The mustic of his spirit out, to seek an answering
                            chord?
                            Not he cold world's acclaim--
                            Not wealth or fickle fame--
                            The song is its own recompense to the singer worth 
                            the name!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        "NEUTRAL"
                        AH, we are " neutral." From our
                            moral heights
                        We stand and watch the Old World's agony,--
                        As careless of its clash of right and wrong
                        The struggle that endures throughout all time,
                        As though some dog-fight caught our roving eye.
                        It is no fight of ours, and there is naught
                        In it of vital interest to us,--
                        Save and except, perhaps, this single thing:
                        The lessons of the Sermon on the Mount,
                        Endangered after nineteen hundred years
                        Of service as the leaven of the earth,
                        Are to be swept away by this base creed
                        Of power, that makes efficiency its god
                        But we are "neutral"--it is naught to us,
                        It gives the Midas touch that turns to gold--
                        The precious thing which in the olden times
                        Mankind made idols of--so we rejoice.
                        We see a nation, waxing great and strong,
                        Plotting, behind a screen of empty words,
                        Against the peace and safety of the earth,--
                        Forgetting nothing in their deep laid plans
                        Save the existence of Almighty God,
                        A God whose laws are just, who "will repay."
                        But were are "neutral"--we return our thanks
                        To Heaven for having "kept us out of war,"
                        The dreadful thing which, besides hurting men,
                        Clips figures off the balances of trade.
                        So let the game go on--whoever wins,
                        We can lose nothing--save our nation's soul--
                        Our old ideal of sacrifce of self
                        
                        And all that renders living worth our while.
                        Ah, moral heights that keep us far removed
                        From all the stains of strife-preserves our
                        calm--
                        And keeps us always "neutral"--blessed word!
                    
                    
                    
                        TO OLD MT. UNION
                        
                            
                                Karo, Kero, Kira, Kee!
                            
                            
                                Rah, Rah, Rah, for M. U. C.!

                                Rah, Rah, Rah, for old Mt. Union!
                            
                        
                        
                            IN my ancient days in college, where I found my
                            fund of knowledge--
                            I regret to say its total is but small,
                            Yet I hold Mt. Union blameless, for by regions
                            that are nameless,
                            It's a marvel I learned anything at all!
                        
                        
                            For I had no boundless yearning for absorbing
                            useful learning,
                            And loitered in the Reading Room devouring
                            magazines;
                            Nor did I hold high revel with those minions of
                            the devil
                            Who wrought havoc with Mt. Union's peaceful
                            scenes;
                        
                        
                            Who painted up the chapel with a lurid, streaky
                            dapple,
                            And smeared it fore and aft with melted cheese,
                            Which assailed our shrinking noses with no per-
                            fume like the rose's,
                            But lingered many moons upon the breeze!
                        
                        
                        
                            Nor was I the wicked donkey who took the ape
                            and monkey,
                            The Mummy, the gorilla--all the freaks in the
                            Museum--
                            And left them, duly labeled, in the chapel, which
                            enabled
                            Each professor to know which one stood for him.
                        
                        
                            You recall those students mighty, who, attired in
                            a nighty,
                            (Nay, let us draw the veil upon that scene),
                            And that deed of fiends benighted who the wrath
                            of heaven invited
                            By painting Prexy's cow a gorgeous green.
                        
                        
                            Ah, today I mourn with sadness that I missed
                            those acts of gladness
                            And let others undertake them in my place,
                            Who now no doubt, are teaching and lecturing
                            and preaching
                            With the sanctity of ministers of grace!
                        
                        
                            Since those old days in Ohio you have won and
                            wedded Scio,
                            And a schoolmate of my college days is Prexy,
                            heaven wots;
                            
                                Alekezenion! Alekizunion! Rah, Rah, Rah for
                            
                            
                                old Mt. Union,
                            
                            On whose name I lay these few for-get-me-nots.
                            
                                Oskewahwah! Skinnewahwah!

                        WHAT IS IT ALL FOR?
                        
                             Mark Tastell, of his litle daugter, after apparently pondering over
                                thing in general, finally asking, "Mamma what is it all
                                for?" To the writer this seems the most important question
                                ever asked--one over, whose answer the philosophers and thelogians
                                have disputed for cen- turies, and which they will probably debate
                                for all time.
                        
                        
                            WELL may we ask again what it is for,
                            The purpose that its future holds in store;
                            The more we ask, we are but baffled more,
                            Since Science and the Scriptures join to say
                            That it shall end and wholly pass away--
                            Alas, the answer lies
                            Beyond our narrow skies!
                        
                        
                            Age after age, aye, since Time first began,
                            Slowly unfolds the wise and wondrous plan,
                            From empty chaos onward up to man--
                            Yet for the final ending of it all,
                            The wise men say, once more an empty ball.
                            How can it seem so glad,
                            When it is all so sad?
                        
                        
                            To what avail shall all the human race
                            Through weary ages struggle on apace,
                            Then its Creator utterly efface
                            All that the age-old effort hath achieved,
                            Ending as though it had not been conceived--
                            Brought forth from misty void,
                            To be again destroyed.
                        
                        
                        
                            Such is our only answer--earth to earth--
                            So closely bound in one are Death and Birth;
                            And much that we achieve has little worth.
                            Yet through it all must every thoughtful man
                            Behold the working of an all-wise plan,
                            Whose end is never clear
                            to our dimmed vision here!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        MY FAITH
                        
                            CREEDS seem to me like dull and faded flowers
                            That once were fresh and lovely, long ago,
                            But might have better served our later hours
                            If they had been passed by, and left to grow.
                        
                        
                            And I doubt not that every moral man
                            Has worshipped by his lights, however dim,
                            A God he pictured out on his own plan--
                            A God that was Divine--at least to him!
                        
                        
                            Man writes his revelations and his creeds
                            With eyes half blinded by his hopes and fears;
                            Each serves in its own time some human needs--
                            But the unchanging God deals not in years.
                        
                        
                            So, while in none I utterly believe,
                            None would I wholly pass unheeding by;
                            Since truth and error ever interweave,
                            We find in each some message from on High.
                        
                        
                            The primal law of earthly things is growth;
                            In mind and spirit also must we grow;
                            Our cramping creeds should then, indeed, be loath
                            To say, "Thus far, no farther, shalt thou go."
                        
                        
                            Nor can I hold that to a favored few
                            The God of Ages gives all truth divine,
                            While other faiths are error, through and through,
                            With evil end and origin malign;
                        
                        
                        
                            But rather hold that truth in many a guise
                            Gleams through them all, but changed in outward
                            dress;
                            That each may bring the Light to eager eyes,
                            And human need with aid and comfort bless.
                        
                        
                            So I believe the views of the Divine,
                            In which each man finds solace for his soul,
                            Are only fragments--yours as well as mine--
                            Each finding but a fraction of the Whole.
                        
                        
                            And since our wisdom, after all, is dumb
                            About so much in our existence here,
                            Why need our visions of the life to come
                            Be limned in lines, unchangeable and clear?
                        
                        
                            We know through ages dark with hate and fear,
                            On groping, twilight paths our race has trod,
                            And hope, at last, the dawning day is near,
                            To light our pathway to the changeless God.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        JUDGE NOT
                        
                            "Judge not, that ye be not judged"
                        
                        
                            I WOULD these simple words of Christ
                            Might be obeyed with greater heed;
                            Our wayward feet, to wrong enticed,
                            Should teach the tongue their utmost need.
                        
                        
                            Ah no! A self appointed judge,
                            We sit upon our lofty throne,
                            Free to condemn the fellow drudge
                            Whose frailties differ from our own.
                        
                        
                            We know not through what mists of tears
                            Environment hath led them on,
                            Or, heritage of bygone years,
                            Heredity held them in pawn.
                        
                        
                            So, knowing not the hidden source
                            From which their wayward acts have sprung,
                            We let harsh judgment take its course,
                            And lash them with unbridled tongue.
                        
                        
                            Remembering not Whose voice it was
                            That bade us "first cast out the beam,"
                            We carp at all our neighbor does,
                            And censure flows in ceaseless stream.
                        
                        
                            But with what measure ye shall mete,
                            It shall be measured back again;
                            Who then shall say "revenge is sweet,"
                            And harshly judge his fellow men!
                        
                        
                        
                            The world is wide, and narrow sects 
                            Would better serve man's lowly lot
                            By harping less on outgrown texts,
                            And heeding Christ's own words, "Judge
                                not."
                        
                        
                            I would these precious words of His
                            We might bear with us through the strife--
                            No more to know what hatred is,
                            No more to judge another's life!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE HERMIT
                        I was a hermit, not in the living flesh,
                        Not barred from humankind by lonely miles,
                        Nor dwelling in some far, sequestered hut;
                        My hermitage was rather of the soul,
                        Shut out from human ties by unseen bars,
                        And loneliest among the jostling crowd.
                        Mere miles of space may quickly be traversed,
                        But the impalpable barriers that shut
                        The shrinking soul from human sympathy
                        Can only be surmounted--if at all--
                         By slow and groping steps on unknown paths.
                        My youth fed on the fancies of Romance,
                        And faithfully I worshipped at the shrine
                        Of the fair God of Things as they should be,
                        Unmindful of the God of Things that Are.
                        With passing years were these illusions lost,
                        And I was dowered with eyes that saw below
                        The fair exterior to the unclean core.
                        I saw, at last, Life's bitter irony,
                        The wine press whose unfeeling touch can crush
                        The wine of laughter from the grapes of tears.
                        Yet, through it all, I came at last to see
                        The danger in the path of souls like mine.
                        I saw that he whose highest aim in life
                        Is but to get the utmost out of it
                        Gets nothing that can be of lasting worth;
                        The soul grows rich alone through what it spends.
                        I have learned Faith from the perennial Spring
                        That ever bursts the Winter's buds anew,
                        
                        Learned Patience from the slow and plodding plow,
                        And Charity from all the griefs and sins
                        Forever interwoven through our lot.
                        And, though the Life within may seek in vain
                        An outlet through the streams of spoken speech,
                        It may, perchance, like some deep-hidden spring,
                        Find outlet that, unseen, shall bless the earth,
                        Escaping from its spirit hermitage,
                        To merge and fuse its lot with all mankind.
                    
                    
                    
                        THE PRICE
                        
                            "For all we take we must pay; but the price is cruel
                                high."
                            
                                WISDOM OF PRIVATE MULVANEY
                            
                        
                        
                            LIFE lays its wealth before us--you and I
                            Take what we will--but ever, ere we die,
                            We find in truth, "the price is cruel high."
                        
                        
                            This hoary truth each soul anew must learn,
                            That nothing comes to those who nothing earn.
                            And he who takes must render full return.
                        
                        
                            In countless ways Life takes its bitter toll-
                            Health, peace-succes, unsated at its goal--
                            All things are legal tender of the soul.
                        
                        
                            Sometimes the price may seem to us unjust--
                            One blind surrender to a fleshly lust
                            Bring costs that only end with " dust to dust!"
                        
                        
                            We seek escape from an entangling mesh
                            Of past mistakes--to each Fate comes afresh,
                            A Shylock asking for the pound of flesh.
                        
                        
                            We murmur at the cost, and to our cry,
                            "The wage of sin is death"--the
                                old reply--
                            From the beginning has the price been high.
                        
                        
                            Nor must we pay a price for wrong alone,
                            And reap the harvest that ourselves have sown;
                            Yea, even good has costs that we must own.
                        
                        
                        
                            All that we gain is somehow gained by loss;
                            The price is high for noble things, or gross,
                            And each in turn must bear his grievous cross.
                        
                        
                            So with the artist, to whose jealous art
                            Are sacrificed the passions of his heart,
                            And holiest of ties are rent apart.
                        
                        
                            "For all we take" the payment must be made,
                            Nor can it be evaded or delayed; 
                            "The price is cruel high"--but it is paid.
                        
                        
                            Our envious eyes see lavish Fortune pour,
                            And swell our brother's portion more and more--
                            But he, and not ourselves, must pay the score.
                        
                        
                            We see the golden harvest, sheaf on sheaf,
                            Nor pause to think the reaping time is brief,
                            Or that the seed was sown in toil and grief.
                        
                        
                            We long for good to triumph over vice,
                            But find our souls too weak to pay the price--
                            So even Peter denied his Master thrice.
                        
                        
                            The art of living is the highest art--
                            Here lies its secret, that we play our part,
                            And pay its price with an ungrudging heart.
                        
                        
                            Life lays its wealth before us--with a sigh
                            Of unfulfilled desire we pass it by,
                            Remembering "the price is cruel high."
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SAYIN' GOODBYE
                        
                            THERE'S words I always hate t' use--they'd
                                fill
                            at least a column--
                            'N' one of 'em's that word
                                "goodbye"--it sounds
                            so sad 'n' solumn!
                            You jus' can't say it t' y'r
                                friends without y'r eyes
                            a-smartin', 
                            'N' seems as though thsi life of ours is
                                jus' made
                            up of partin'
                            So, since my hatred of the word is great, and 
                            growin' greater,
                            My custom is t' say, instead, "So long,
                                I'll see y'
                            later."
                        
                        
                            Of course, I know "Goodbye" sounds best t'
                                head
                            a song er poem,
                            But t' th' friends y'r parted from,
                                jus' as y' get
                            t' know 'em,
                            It sounds so sort of final-like it draws y'r heart-
                            strings tighter;
                            So it's my way t' pass it by f'r phrases
                                that are
                            brighter.
                            I hate "goodbye," "adieu,"
                                "farewell"--'n' I'm
                            a hearty hater--
                            So in their place I always say, "So long, I'll
                                see
                            y' later."
                        
                        
                            I hate th' words "The End" in books, that
                                seemed,
                            in th' beginnin',
                            So jolly-like 'n' funny that y'
                                couldn't keep fr'm
                            grinnin'--
                            
                            'N' then that word they use instead, I always
                                wish
                            was minus,
                            W'y should they end an English book with that
                            blamed Latin "Finis"?
                            Dear Reader, if you'll be so kind, and to my wishes 
                            cater,
                            We'll shake each other's paws
                                'n' say,
                            "So long, I'll see y'
                                later!"
