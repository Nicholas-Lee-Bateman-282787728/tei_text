        <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> following verses were suggested by incidents and objects observed
          along the wayside and written during the leisure hours vouchsafed to the author midst the
          cares and labors incident to a physician's busy life, and he feels assured that, by their
          sentiment and expression, no one who may honor them with a perusal will thereby be made
          the worse, if not the better. Any misgivings he may have had in presenting this volume for
          public favor have been overshadowed by the solicitude and partiality of loving friends;
          and if he has furnished enough honey, extracted from the flowers of fancy, to fill one
          little cell in the great poetical hive, he will feel that his songs have not been sung in
          vain.<lb></lb> <hi rend="i">Vincennes, Ind., May, 1898</hi>.</p>

          <head rend="center">At Midnight</head>

          <lg>
            <l>'Tis midnight hour, a holy time for thought,</l>
            <l>A solemn silence reigns, and not a sound</l>
            <l>Is heard to break the perfect stillness. E'en</l>
            <l>The wakeful whip-poor-will's last plaintive song</l>
            <l>Of mournful melody has died away</l>
            <l>Within the distant hills.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l rend="ti-3">Whilst nature seems</l>
            <l>In deep and darkling grandeur to repose,</l>
            <l>And all of earth by sable folds of night</l>
            <l>Is hidden from the view, which could disturb</l>
            <l>The chain of thought that reaches other worlds,</l>
            <l>'Tis sweet to sit in contemplation rapt</l>
            <l>And hold communion with the spirit land.</l>
            <l>For, in this deep and holy solitude</l>
            <l>The baser feelings of the erring heart</l>
          </lg>

          <pb id="VAA9481-013" n="12"/>



          <lg>
            <l>Are stilled by spirit whisperings I seem</l>
            <l>To hear. The flow'rets sweet that gem the vale--</l>
            <l>The verdant landscape, robed in beauteousness--</l>
            <l>The crystal, rippling streams, whose cadences</l>
            <l>E'er fall in monotones upon the ear,</l>
            <l>Alike are from the keenest vision veiled.</l>
            <l>And yet, from soothing influence they shed,</l>
            <l>I feel as if bright guardian angels watched</l>
            <l>The footsteps of each silent worshiper,</l>
            <l>Who wanders midst the solitudes of night.</l>
            <l>Far in the western horizon, up-piled,</l>
            <l>Like mountains covered with perpetual snow,</l>
            <l>The fleecy clouds, "the drapery of heaven,"</l>
            <l>In grandeur move, on airy wings upborne,</l>
            <l>Athwart the boundless space.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l rend="ti-3">The crescent moon</l>
            <l>That rode in queenly majesty the sky,</l>
            <l>When nascent earth commenced its onward<lb/> course,</l>
            <l>Still sheds its soft and silv'ry light, to gild</l>
            <l>The firmament, as if it were a lamp</l>
            <l>Hung out from vast eternity's domain</l>
            <l>To guide departing spirits from below</l>
            <l>To heavenly realms where joys immortal are.</l>

          <pb id="VAA9481-014" n="13"/>


          <lg>
            <l>The glittering stars, that with effulgent beams</l>
            <l>Of beauty and of splendor gemmed the sky</l>
            <l>And sung the morning hymn of time, still shed</l>
            <l>Their radiance from the eboned brow of night,</l>
            <l>Keeping their watch sublime, like sentinels</l>
            <l>Upon the everlasting walls of heaven.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The hour and scene invite my thoughts above,</l>
            <l>As fancy plumes its spirit wings, and peers</l>
            <l>Into creation's vast immensity.</l>
            <l>Oh ! what a changeless harmony pervades</l>
            <l>The universe throughout. The seasons come</l>
            <l>And go in making up the rounds of time,</l>
            <l>Without one jarring discord to disturb</l>
            <l>The unison of the connected whole.</l>
            <l>The years, the months, the weeks, and days succeed</l>
            <l>Each other now, as when they first began.</l>
            <l>When we behold all things of earth and sky</l>
            <l>Move on with one accord in endless paths,</l>

            <l>Our tongues, invoking adoration's voice,</l>
            <l>Proclaim aloud their origin divine.</l>

            <l>Of being? He's as but a little speck,</l>
            <l>Tossed to and fro, by every passing wind.</l>
            <l>If, then, O man, thou still art proud and vain,</l>

            <l>And be ye humbled low; and know that all</l>
            <l>Thy pomp and splendor soon will pass away,</l>
            <l>As doth the bubble on the wayward stream;</l>
            <l>"For dust thou art, to dust thou shalt return ! "</l>

            <l>If not with God, in paradise, oh ! where?</l>
            <l>In death's dark charnel-house, Philosophy,</l>
            <l>Awe-struck and dumb, steps back and offers not</l>
            <l>One word of comfort to the stricken heart,</l>
            <l>And throws no ray of light to guide the soul</l>
            <l>Winging its way beyond the shores of time.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>The mountain stream with swiftness glides along,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Through flowery vales and deep and shady wood,</l>
            <l>Singing in monotones its daily song,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Unheard within the haunts of solitude</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Of nature's holiest halls, save by the rude</l>
            <l>And hardy but ingenuous mountaineer,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Who listens in a meditative mood;</l>
            <l>And feathered minstrels and the nimble deer,</l>
            <l>That oft, at morn and eve, delight to linger here.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Lit by the eye of morn, all beaming bright,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Its glassy bosom seems forever new</l>
            <l>In beauteousness, tinged with the golden light;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And, like the evanescent shining dew,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Its waters sparkle with a pearly hue</l>
            <l>As they are upward thrown, in foaming spray,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">By trout and bass whilst darting swiftly through</l>
            <l>Its pure and cooling depths in sportive play,</l>
            <l>And bask a moment in the sun's warm, genial ray.</l>

          <pb id="VAA9481-017" n="16"/>


          <lg>
            <l>For there no cruel angler's bearded hook,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Concealed with care beneath a tempting bait,</l>
            <l>Has e'er been thrown to lure, from cranny nook,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Its denizens his appetite to sate;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">But, from the early dawn till twilight late,</l>
            <l>Unconscious of the wiles of man they move;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Each one attended by a chosen mate</l>
            <l>Enthralled by nature's instinct-ties, or love</l>
            <l>Like that which sweetly governs earth and heaven above.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Along its rising banks the tall pine trees</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Lift up their heads, as if to pierce the sky,</l>
            <l>And wave their plumage to the wayward breeze</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That oft hath swept mid threat'ning thunders by,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Making a wild and mournful melody,</l>
            <l>Which falls upon the lone heart, touched with woe,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">In sad yet soothing strains, waking a sigh</l>
            <l>Responsive, and which prompts sad tears to flow,</l>
            <l>As mem'ry calls up joys that perished mid their glow.</l>

          <pb id="VAA9481-018" n="17"/>



          <lg>
            <l>Like radiant gems upon the brow of night,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">With bright and varied hues the perfumed flowers</l>
            <l>Bedeck the rugged bank's ascending height,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Wreathing with beauty's robe the wildwood bowers;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And far aloft, within the distance towers</l>
            <l>A mighty mountain's top, mid heaven's deep blue,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Like a portentous cloud that threat'ning lowers</l>
            <l>O'er earth, imparting grandeur to the view,</l>
            <l>As lightnings flash and dart athwart with vivid hue.</l>
          </lg>


          <lg>
            <l>Whilst here I gaze on this enchanting scene,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Where nature is in rich attire arrayed,</l>
            <l>As jocund morning, clothed with silv'ry sheen,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Beams on the earth, without one darkling shade</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To mar the glowing loveliness displayed;</l>
            <l>My heart grows sad, as mem'ry calls to mind</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The poor and much-wronged Indians we have made</l>
            <l>To flee these hills, and dales, and leave behind</l>
            <l>Their earthly homes, where dearest ties of life were twined.</l>

          <pb id="VAA9481-019" n="18"/>



          <lg>
            <l>Methinks I now can see some on yon hill</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Uprising far aloft, as there they sit</l>
            <l>Absorbed in thought, whilst all around is still,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">As they survey their homes, before they quit</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Their sacred haunts for aye; how quickly flit</l>
            <l>Before their minds the scenes of childhood's day;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Emotions, as they there alternate knit</l>
            <l>Their brows, or faces wreathe with smiles, display</l>
            <l>Their thoughts, as they in justice' name for vengeance pray.</l>
          </lg>


          <lg>
            <l>Here each upon a mother's breast was nursed,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">As blooming flowers enfold the morning dew ;</l>
            <l>Here is the glassy stream that mirrored first</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Their lithe and childish forms, to nature true;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Here are the vales where lovers met to woo,</l>
            <l>When spring's warm breath begemmed the em'rald sod,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And o'er each scene a sweet enchantment threw;</l>
            <l>Here all their dead lie buried 'neath the clod,</l>
            <l>And here the grottoes where they worshiped nature's God !</l>
          </lg>


          <pb id="VAA9481-020" n="19"/>



          <lg>
            <l>Yes, here beneath the overarching stones</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Nature's deft fingers have with artful skill</l>
            <l>Formed fitting tombs; and here lie bleaching bones</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Of kin who did through changeless laws fulfill,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">In time, their mete of years, as God did will;</l>
            <l>And here they laid in peaceful, hallowed rest</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Till vandals sought this consecrated hill</l>
            <l>And delved within its depths, in quest</l>
            <l>Of relics, at imperious science' stern behest.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Oh ! could they lightly leave each vale and hill,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And burst the many ties that round them cling,</l>
            <l>And blot from mem'ry all that's dear, at will?</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Intruder, hast thou naught but gold to bring,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To pluck out of the stricken heart the sting,</l>
            <l>Which thou hast with thy hand implanted there ?</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Away with thy polluting offering,</l>
            <l>For it can ne'er atone for one dark care,</l>
            <l>Or tear of sorrow shed in deep and wild despair !</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>O man, thy inhumanity hath made</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Millions of hearts to bleed, and sink all crushed</l>
            <l>With woe ; and yet thy thirst seems still unstayed,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And kindness' voice within thy bosom hushed ;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Though earth, for wrongs, with crimsoned streams hath blushed,</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-021" n="20"/>



            <l>And injured innocence hath cried to heaven</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">For retribution at His hands, still, flushed</l>
            <l>With hope of gain, thou hast the Red Man driven</l>
            <l>Westward, to find a home beneath the sun of even!</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Flow on bright stream in beauty and in pride,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And as the winds which kiss thy face as free;</l>
            <l>And sing sweet songs, as thou dost onward glide</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Laving the mountain's base, and flow'ry lea;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Thy music's but a song of minstrelsy</l>
            <l>Of nature, waked by the eternal One,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Who formed from chaos, earth and sky and sea,</l>
            <l>And guides the planetary worlds that run,</l>
            <l>Swiftly within their orbits, round the glowing sun.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Upon the flow'ry banks I love to stray</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And drink the cooling waters as they stream</l>
            <l>Along, and listen to the wild bird's lay</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Of melody ; for here thy scenes but seem</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To me, like slumber's most enchanting dream ;</l>
            <l>As here are birds, and flowers, and mountains grand,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And as bright summer throws on each her beam,</l>
            <l>They all conspire, with beauty's magic wand,</l>
            <l>To make them like the realms of fancy's fairyland.</l>

            <l>Have faded in their luster,</l>

            <l>At rest, dear belov'd one, at last and forever,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Safe in the arms of thy Savior's pure love !</l>
            <l>Disease with its fingers life's tendrils must sever</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Ere the spirit can mount on its pinions above;</l>
            <l>For we are but pilgrims and vigils e'er keeping,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">For angels to guide to the heavenly goal,</l>
            <l>Where deepest affliction, and sorrow, and weeping</l>

          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Like the meteor's flash in the concave of heaven,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Bless'd spirits depart from their bodies of clay;</l>
            <l>They come with the morning, depart with the even,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">But leave sweetest mem'ries to mark each bright way.</l>
            <l>Like the dust that is left of the meteor's burning,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Our bodies dissolve and become as the clod ;</l>
            <l>While our souls take departure, in triumph, returning</l>

          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>We part with the loved one in trust, but in sorrow,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Though her body reposes within the cold grave,</l>
            <l>That again we shall meet her on heaven's to-morrow,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Since the One who has taken is mighty to save.</l>

            <l>Like the perfume of flowers, in morning's bright glowing,</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Her life lent a light like the sunshine above her,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Her heart was as pure as the snowflake just cast;</l>
            <l>And none ever knew her but soon learned to love her,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Which love was enduring with time as it passed.</l>
            <l>She ever was patient, with heart so confiding,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Though affliction encompassed and burthened her life :</l>
            <l>Her faith in the Savior was ever abiding,</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Behind the dear features and all that was mortal,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Her white soul seemed shining with translucent light,</l>
            <l>And angels were waiting to ope heaven's portal,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And welcome in peans their songs of delight.</l>
            <l>She left us in sorrow and, haltingly, groping</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">In darkness, still treading the shores of life's stream,</l>
            <l>But not without comfort, and sweetest of hoping,</l>

            <l>In that other country, where life is eternal,</l>

          </lg>

          <lg>

            <l>Again I tread my own dear native land,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Where ev'ry stream and hill and vale and grot,</l>
            <l>So beautifully formed by nature's hand,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Combine to make it seem a garden spot;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And gaze upon my father's humble cot,</l>
            <l>Where many scenes of joy departed lie,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Oh, I could wish no happier lot</l>
            <l>Than here to live beneath its genial sky,</l>

            <l>Thy haunts, dear Avondale, were not forgot</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Whilst I was wand'ring far away from thee,</l>
            <l>For time can never with its pencil blot</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Thy bright and joyous scenes from memory.</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And oft when all around would cheerless be,</l>

            <l rend="ti-1">I've turned my thoughts o'er life's tempestu'us sea</l>
            <l>To thee, when gladness buoyed up my heart,</l>

          <lg>
            <l>But, since I looked so fondly on thee last</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">With friends, a change has o'er thee come, and thou,</l>
            <l>Dear home, with deepest gloom seem'st overcast;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">For lately where there was but joy, oh ! now,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">A sadness rests upon each inmate's brow,</l>
            <l>That tells that fearful death, with fatal doom,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Hath made a dear and cherished one to bow</l>
            <l>Before his scythe, that ever reaps in gloom,</l>
            <l>To rise no more till heaven shall burst the fettered tomb.</l>

            <l>Ah, yes, dear sister, thou hast passed from earth,</l>

            <l>And as we gather round our father's hearth,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Where once was happiness, when thou wert here,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Oh ! oft will flow affection's sacred tear</l>
            <l>In memory of thee. We did not think,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Alas, that one to us so very dear</l>
            <l>Would pass so soon away, and in death sink,</l>

            <l>The partner of thy bosom, who hath been</l>

            <l>And joys, now bows in mourning to the keen</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> And poignant anguish that his bosom fills,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">As grief its dregs of sorrow there distills.</l>

            <l>The little ones, which thou didst leave behind,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Feel much thy loss; but in the One who wills</l>
            <l>Thee hence, a kind protector they will find,</l>
            <l>For he to the shorn lambs tempers the chilling wind.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>But, oh ! 'tis cheering to each aching heart</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That is now bowed in deepest grief, to know</l>
            <l>That thou from earth wert ready to depart,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To Him, who plucked from thee life's bitter woe</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And robbed death of its keen and fatal throe,</l>
            <l>As thy soul poised, betwixt the earth and sky,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Ere leaving its clay tenement below</l>
            <l>To soar away to brighter realms on high,</l>
            <l>Where angels sing their ceaseless songs of melody.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Dear sister, though thou'rt in the tomb beneath</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The turf, that soon will wear a brighter hue,</l>
            <l>As spring again entwines its emerald wreath</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Where zephyrs will delight, at eve, to woo</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The flowers, and kiss from them the shining dew,</l>
            <l>We often will in deepest anguish weep</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Thy loss, and o'er thy grave sweet flowers strew ;</l>
            <l>And e'er thy form embalmed in mem'ry keep :</l>

          <lg>
            <l>I saw him in the sunny hour of life,</l>
            <l>When health glowed on his cheeks like the bright blush</l>
            <l>That tints the rose at morning's dewy hour.</l>
            <l>His brow, o'er which his tresses lightly played,</l>
            <l>Was yet unfurrowed by a trace of care,</l>
            <l>And seemed, amid its snowy whiteness, fit</l>
            <l>To shrine the purest thoughts that gem the mind.</l>
            <l>No star shone brighter in the milky-way</l>
            <l>Than did the luster of his piercing eye,</l>
            <l>For it was lit by genius' glowing fire</l>
            <l>And ev'ry glance it gave fell on the heart,</l>
            <l>Like gleaming sunbeam on the dancing wave:</l>
            <l>To him the world was bright and beautiful,</l>
            <l> For no dark cloud had thrown its somber wing</l>
            <l>Across the clear horizon of his life,</l>
            <l>To dim one scene of beauty or of love.</l>
            <l>And no keen pang of sorrow yet had pierced</l>
            <l>His breast, to mar the dreamy bliss of youth,</l>
            <l>Which trembled on his heart-strings like the tones</l>
            <l>Of music dying on the harp's sweet chords.</l>
            <l>"None knew him but to love him," for his heart</l>

            <pb id="VAA9481-064" n="63"/>



            <l>Was a fit temple-home of heaven-born love,</l>
            <l>And it was ladened with affection's flowers,</l>
            <l>Which shed a sacred influence around.</l>
            <l>But, ah ! ambition fired his breast and hope</l>
            <l>With siren cadence whispered in his ear</l>
            <l>Her witching song, and threw around his mind</l>
            <l>A halo bright, and bade him look aloft,</l>
            <l>And view the mount of fame, where honors beam,</l>
            <l>And pluck a fadeless wreath of glory there.</l>
            <l>Fair knowledge opened wide her golden gates,</l>
            <l>And beckoned him to range her flow'ry fields</l>
            <l>Of Poesy, and from Castalian stream</l>
            <l>Drink deep, while by its banks meand'ring there.</l>
            <l>Entranced by such alluring, tempting scenes,</l>
            <l>He eager sought to wander midst the bowers</l>
            <l>Of beauty, and, 'neath shade of sylvan groves</l>
            <l>That drooped with ladened sweetness on their boughs,</l>
            <l>To quaff the dews of nectar sparkling there,</l>
            <l>Which wisdom shook from her ambrosial wing.</l>
            <l>Joy filled his soul, as from the hoary page</l>
            <l>Of history he gleaned and treasured up</l>
            <l>In mem'ry's urn the love of ancient days.</l>
            <l>And as he delved within the golden mine</l>
            <l>Of science, and explored its labyrinths,</l>
            <l>With viewless wings time passed, unheeded by,</l>
            <l>Leaving no care imprinted on his brow,</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-065" n="64"/>
            <l>Or darkling shadow brooding o'er his mind.</l>
            <l>Oh, he was happy as the merry birds</l>
            <l>That trilled their morning music by his door,</l>
            <l>For no sad thoughts then rested on his heart</l>
            <l>To mar the blissful present, or to dim</l>
            <l>The radiant future rising on his view.</l>
            <l>He little dreamed as thus he wandered on,</l>
            <l>Plucking the gems of beauty clust'ring round,</l>
            <l>That there was lurking in his path a foe,</l>
            <l>Whose deadly, poisoned shafts should pierce his breast,</l>
            <l>And rankle in its depths, till death drank up</l>
            <l>His young life's blood. Ah, no, bright visions filled</l>
            <l>His brilliant mind, and fancy painted all</l>
            <l>The scenes of coming years with vivid hues</l>
            <l>Of beaut'ousness, and joy his bosom thrilled,</l>
            <l>As fame's bright mount first on his vision burst.</l>
            <l>I saw him yet again, but, oh, how changed!</l>
            <l>Consumption, fell destroyer of our race,</l>
            <l>With fatal aim had pierced his manly breast,</l>
            <l>And he was fading as a lovely flower</l>
            <l>That nurtures 'neath its leaves a blighting worm;</l>
            <l>But, like the eagle stricken in its flight,</l>
            <l>"He nursed the pinion that impelled the steel."</l>
            <l>His firm elastic step was gone. His form,</l>
            <l>Once noble in its mein, was drooped and bowed.</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-066" n="65"/>

            <l>The hue upon his cheeks, once fresh and bright,</l>
            <l>Had paled before disease's touch, and seemed</l>
            <l>Like a soft tint upon the ev'ning cloud</l>
            <l>Reflected from the golden orb of day.</l>
            <l>His noble brow was still untouched by time,</l>
            <l>But sorrow's wing had swept by it and left</l>
            <l>A shadow resting on its white expanse.</l>
            <l>And, yet, his eye beamed with unwonted fire,</l>
            <l>And ev'ry glance was like the meteor's flash,</l>
            <l>That leaves us spell-bound by its mystic light.</l>
            <l>And, still, he seemed unconscious that sad change</l>
            <l>Had left its impress graven on his form,</l>
            <l>And all still beaut'ous seemed, for no dread thought</l>
            <l>Entered his mind to tell him that the sands</l>
            <l>Of life had nearly run their hurried course;</l>
            <l>Or that its flick'ring taper dimly burned.</l>
            <l>The future was imbued with rainbow hues,</l>
            <l>And ev'ry scene was tinged by joy and love</l>
            <l>And ev'ry music tone, of hope's sweet song,</l>
            <l>Still in his heart an answering echo found.</l>
            <l>But, ah! the blissful dreams that filled his mind,</l>
            <l>And threw a sweet enchantment round each scene</l>
            <l>To thrill the heart, were soon to fade away,</l>
            <l>Like hues of beauty from a sun-lit cloud,</l>
            <l>And be like a vain mem'ry of the past.</l>
            <l>I saw him never more! Weeks passed away</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-067" n="66"/>

            <l>And spring yielded once more her roseate wreath</l>
            <l>To bind bright summer's golden brow, but, ah,</l>
            <l>It brought no joy--no healing on its wings,</l>
            <l>To soothe the stricken breast--no power to pluck</l>
            <l>From out its depths the deadly sting of death!</l>
            <l>Ah, no, his fate was sealed, and like the rose</l>
            <l>Plucked from its stem at noon, he drooped and died;</l>
            <l>For, ere the frosts of autumn chilled the earth,</l>
            <l>With summer's leaves and fading flowers</l>
            <l>His form in silence rested in the tomb--</l>
            <l>His spirit, freed from dust, returned to heaven!</l>

            <l>Mid'st ether blue, appears afar;</l>
            <l>But ev'ning's sweet mysterious powers,</l>
            <l>And glancing stars, in heav'nly bowers,</l>
            <l>Cast not the shadow from my brow,</l>
            <l>For thou art absent from me now.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Come home ! Though ming'ling with the throng</l>
            <l>Around the festive board, and song</l>
            <l>And wit, and beauty's lustrous eyes,</l>

            <l>As they display their witcheries,</l>
            <l>Enliven every scene of night</l>
            <l>To fill the soul with pure delight;</l>
            <l>Yet, even then, amid the gay</l>
            <l>My thoughts to thee in fondness stray.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Come home! Night moves apace, and all</l>
            <l>The earth is covered with a pall;</l>
            <l>And even songs from whip-poor-will</l>
            <l>Are hushed upon the distant hill;</l>
            <l>And tired nature's sweet repose</l>
            <l>In balmy sleep my eyelids close;</l>
            <l>And then, in dreams supremely blest,</l>
            <l>My head is pillowed on thy breast.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>But, ah ! the morning comes, and far</l>
            <l>Recedes its fading, twilight star</l>
            <l>As Sol, with bright and beaming eye,</l>
            <l>Ascends aloft the eastern sky;</l>
            <l>And visions sweet which swayed the heart</l>
            <l>As if by magic now depart,</l>
            <l>And I awake, with rosy day,</l>
            <l>To find I dreamed--thou art away.</l>

          <pb id="VAA9481-089" n="88"/>



          <lg>
            <l>Yet still I'd dream that dream again;</l>
            <l>Its pleasure far outweighs the pain,</l>
            <l>As oft as sleep my eyelids seal</l>
            <l>Though waking hours the cheat reveal;</l>
            <l>For then each parted spirit meets</l>
            <l>And heart with heart in fondness beats,</l>
            <l>And loving lips give kiss for kiss,</l>
            <l>And quaff the cup of earthly bliss.</l>

          <head rend="center">A Love Idyl -- and Moral</head>


          <lg>
            <l>Fair Nettie and lover went riding one day,</l>
            <l>And, whether it happened in June or in May,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To the ones interested it doesn't much matter;</l>
            <l>But this they remember, while going along</l>
            <l>Engaged in sweet converse or snatches of song,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The birds in the tree-tops oft chimed in their chatter.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Their hearts were aglow with love's mystical cheer,</l>
            <l>And, as Cupid stood sentry, they felt not a fear</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">While nature was wearing her robes so beguiling;</l>
            <l>And as they drove slowly along the highway</l>
            <l>They looked at each other but had little to say,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Though their hands were enclasped and their faces were smiling.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The day was as pleasant as each could desire,</l>
            <l>And prairie and woodland did jointly conspire</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To add to their many awakened new blisses;</l>
            <l>While the roses and daisies in shadow and light</l>
            <l>Each caught the true spirit of their company quite,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And swapped with the bees and butterflies kisses.</l>
          </lg>


          <pb id="VAA9481-091" n="90"/>




          <lg>
            <l>Oh! these were dear moments, when words sweet and low,</l>
            <l>Which uttered in accents that none else may know,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Not even the lilies which round them were blooming,</l>
            <l>And ever kept looking and winking so sly,</l>
            <l>As if they were asking "the wherefore and why,"</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Until their bold actions seemed rather presuming,</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>For there are some wooings too sacred and dear</l>
            <l>For any but lovers to see and to hear;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Yea, even the flowers so smiling and winning;</l>
            <l>And had Adam and Eve done their courting aright,</l>
            <l>With no one in hearing, and no one in sight,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Our race might be freed from its woe and its sinning.</l>
          </lg>


          <lg>
            <l>The past soon was faded from each other's view,</l>
            <l>And with the blank future they had nothing to do;</l>
            <l>Alone, in the present, they knew, they were living</l>
            <l>And, oh! how the moments sped swiftly away</l>
            <l>On wings tinged with beauty, like halos of day,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">While each of sweet pleasures were taking and giving.</l>
          </lg>


          <pb id="VAA9481-092" n="91"/>




          <lg>
            <l>They drove through the woodland and prairie domain,</l>
            <l>Where the lark's song in meadow and thrush's refrain</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Upon the fresh breezes came piping and trilling,</l>
            <l>To add to their wooings with musical zest,</l>
            <l>As turned were their faces to the sun-setting west,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">When they were not busy in cooing and billing.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>With hearts thus enraptured by love's genial glow,</l>
            <l>It can not be wondered if each made a vow</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">In words of devotion and deepest affection;</l>
            <l>And that was the sequel of driving that day,</l>
            <l>And whether 'twas June or whether it was May,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">They each say the evening was one of perfection.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Yes, Nettie and lover avow and agree</l>
            <l>That that outing is sacred, and ever will be;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">In fact they declare 'twas superb and delicious,</l>
            <l>And say they'd repeat it (if allowed thus to speak</l>
            <l>And give their opinions) each day in the week,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">If all the conditions were just as propitious.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>When first I saw thee, Mary,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">There was a gentle thrill,</l>
            <l>That swept across my heart-strings</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That lingers sweetly still.</l>
            <l>Thine eyes, so bright and beaming,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And brow, by tresses twined,</l>
            <l>But told me of the jewel,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That was within enshrined.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Oh, then a feeling, Mary,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That kindred souls alone</l>
            <l>Can have, came o'er me stealing,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And told me thou art one;</l>
            <l>And, at that joyous moment,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Dear friendship's tender cords</l>
            <l>Did twine themselves around me,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Whilst list'ning to thy words.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And often since, dear Mary,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Thy voice has calmed to rest</l>
            <l>The deep and hidden feelings,</l>

            <pb id="VAA9481-095" n="94"/>

            <l rend="ti-1">Of mental woe and pain,</l>
            <l>Was soothed by thy pure kindness</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And all was well again.</l>
          </lg>

            <l>Yes, though we now are parted,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Thy spell's yet o'er me cast;</l>

          <p rend="center">(Inscribed to my boyhood friends.)</p>
          <lg>
            <l>Dear friends, companions of my early days,</l>
            <l>Whose worth and genius won the meed of praise,</l>
            <l>Though years upon the wings of time have fled</l>
            <l>Since last by each the fond good-bye was said,</l>
            <l>I know within your hearts dear mem'ry shrines</l>
            <l>Dear thoughts of him, who pens these rambling rhymes</l>
            <l>To you, as erst his muse essayed to sing,</l>
            <l>And soared away on fancy's shining wing.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>As sunlight through the parting clouds of day</l>
            <l>Returns again, when storms have passed away,</l>
            <l>To bless the earth and sea with genial beam,</l>
            <l>So scenes of early years with brightness gleam</l>
            <l>Upon the heart, through the dim, shad'wy past,</l>
            <l>To cheer, when life with cares is overcast,</l>
            <l>As memory reopes its treasure urn,</l>
            <l>Where friendship's sacred fires forever burn.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The days, the hours we have together spent</l>
            <l>Seem with my inmost being deeply blent,</l>
            <l>And, though many a change across the heart</l>
            <l>Has swept since then, of life they seem a part;</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-108" n="107"/>


            <l>As when in youth through field and vale we strayed,</l>
            <l>Which were in Flora's gay attire arrayed,</l>
            <l>Or lingered 'neath inviting forest trees,</l>
            <l>To catch the music of the bird and breeze.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Do you remember how, in smiling May,</l>
            <l>When snowy dogwood blooms and redbuds gay</l>
            <l>Bedecked the forest dells, away we hied,</l>
            <l>To sport within the flowing crystal tide?</l>
            <l>An elder rod, a string, a bent pin hook</l>
            <l>Full oft made up our tackle for the brook;</l>
            <l>But if by chance a better we could boast,</l>
            <l>Oh, how the shiners and the perch were tossed.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And mind you when, in glowing summer hours,</l>
            <l>We roamed o'er field and glade to gather flowers</l>
            <l>Yet bathed with dews--the beauteous tears of night--</l>
            <l>Which starlight beamed beneath the morning's light?</l>
            <l>They had no tongues and yet they did impart</l>
            <l>Lessons, that touched with tenderness the heart;</l>
            <l>They spoke not, yet their incense on the air</l>
            <l>Thrilled our young bosoms like the voice of prayer.</l>
          </lg>

          <pb id="VAA9481-109" n="108"/>


          <lg>
            <l>Do you remember how in autumn days,</l>
            <l>When earth was wrapped in Indian summer's haze,</l>
            <l>Amid the falling leaves of every hue,</l>
            <l>In search of nuts, we roamed the forest through?</l>
            <l>Although sweet pleasure danced along our way</l>
            <l>Like some wood nymph, or gladsome meadow fay,</l>
            <l>Our hearts were sad, and oft we breathed a sigh,</l>
            <l>To see the lovely verdure fade and die.</l>
          </lg>


          <lg>
            <l>Do you remember the log school-house still</l>
            <l>That stood upon the green and sloping hill,</l>
            <l>Around whose base a little winding stream</l>
            <l>In quiet flowed, and glassed day's sparkling beam?</l>
            <l>And too, the grapevine swing within the wood,</l>
            <l>And rude bark playhouse, that near by it stood,</l>
            <l>Beneath whose roof each one, in mimic pride</l>
            <l>And pomp, some statesman grave personified?</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Rememberest how joyously each noon</l>
            <l>We hailed, and thought that playtimes passed too soon,</l>
            <l>When e'er the mind, engaged in sportive play,</l>
            <l>Was heedless of the passing hours of day?</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-110" n="109"/>


            <l>The eyes, which with sweet glancing beauty burned</l>
            <l>When e'er perchance the teacher's back was turned,</l>
            <l>Spake words the heart alone e'er comprehends,</l>
            <l>Do you remember yet those scenes, dear friends?</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Oh, then our minds were buoyant, and as free</l>
            <l>As winds that kissed the dew-drops from the lea,</l>
            <l>And spurned control, which sought at home or school</l>
            <l>To fetter with the staid or iron rule,</l>
            <l>And though we daily conned our lessons o'er,</l>
            <l>As wisdom opened wide her jeweled store,</l>
            <l>Inviting nature claimed each thought and view,</l>
            <l>And round each heart a sweet enchantment threw.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>For when her voice calls to the yearning heart,</l>
            <l>And wakes each feeling as by magic art,</l>
            <l>'Tis vain, by master's skill or power, to try,</l>
            <l>With hick'ry withe, or threat'ning speech, or eye,</l>
            <l>To chain the mind, and on fair mem'ry's page</l>
            <l>To write the lore of statesman, poet, sage;</l>
            <l>For she alone, by inspiration fraught,</l>
            <l>Can chain at will each wand'ring restless thought.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>'Tis true that there were times when we forsook</l>
            <l>Our sports awhile for some new picture book,</l>
            <l>Or fairy tale, whose wond'rous scenes inflamed</l>
            <l>Our youthful minds and rapt attention claimed,</l>
            <l>As noble deeds of daring, by the score,</l>
            <l>In glowing language were recounted o'er,</l>
            <l>Or those that told of wrongs in pity'ng strains,</l>
            <l>When innocence appealed for help in vain.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>But knotty sums that puzzled and perplexed</l>
            <l>The mind, till it was tired and sorely vexed;</l>
            <l>The prosy sentences in false syntax,</l>
            <l>Which proved for us too oft hard, stubborn facts;</l>
            <l>The hist'ry of each land, and stream and ocean,</l>
            <l>The laws which govern heat, and light and motion;</l>
            <l>And moral codes, that took a tilt at mammon,</l>
            <l>Were often deemed by us the sheerest gammon.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Like bird from cage released, with outstretched wings</l>
            <l>Through ether blue with joy exultant springs,</l>
            <l>Pouring upon the air its sweetest strains,</l>
            <l>Forgetful of its former woes and pains,</l>
            <l>So we, when loosed from weary tasks at school,</l>
            <l>And nought to fear, from look or switch or rule,</l>
            <l>With hoop or ball ran swiftly o'er the plain,</l>
            <l>Rejoicing in our freedom once again.</l>
          </lg>


          <pb id="VAA9481-112" n="111"/>

          <lg>
            <l>Or with the hounds, which seemed our sports to share,</l>
            <l>Through field and glade pursued the timid hare,</l>
            <l>That nimbly coursing o'er familiar track</l>
            <l>Defied full oft the eager, yelping pack;</l>
            <l>Or with our guns and pointers tried our luck</l>
            <l>On flying pigeon, partridge, plover, duck,</l>
            <l>Or cunning squirr'l, that frisked in sportive glee</l>
            <l>And barked surprised upon a greenwood tree.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And when old boreas swept wood and field,</l>
            <l>And all the brooks and fountains were congealed,</l>
            <l>A sport was offered, and we would respond,</l>
            <l>And hasten with our skates to creek or pond,</l>
            <l>Where we, with hands benumbed and flying feet,</l>
            <l>Cut figures queer, which we could not repeat;</l>
            <l>For, if a slip was made, within a trice</l>
            <l>Our heads, not skates, slid on the slippery ice.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Do you remember when, 'neath harvest moon,</l>
            <l>We sallied forth to hunt the sly old coon</l>
            <l>And 'possum, in the wild umbrageous wood,</l>
            <l>As they in darkness foraged for their food</l>
            <l>In creeks, where fish and muscles did abound,</l>
            <l>And wild grapes, and the pawpaws ripe were found ?</l>
            <l>Ah, lucky was the "varmint," doubling back,</l>
            <l>If he deceived our dogs upon his track.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The many escapades we had in sports,</l>
            <l>Whilst chasing game at night in such resorts,</l>
            <l>Seemed not, perhaps, quite orthodox to some,</l>
            <l>Who never strayed from the paternal home.</l>
            <l>But, then, we never went for fun alone,</l>
            <l>And conscience for such acts could well atone;</l>
            <l>And roasted 'possum, served as we could wish,</l>
            <l>With sweet potatoes, was a toothsome dish</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>To tempt an epicure, or prince or lord,</l>
            <l>When placed well garnished on the supper board.</l>
            <l>The cuisine of old auntie, cook, you know,</l>
            <l>We'll ne'er forget, though of the long ago,</l>
            <l>For then to taste it was a chief delight,</l>
            <l>When freed from book and task on Saturday night,</l>
            <l>As we would meet to tell our exploits o'er,</l>
            <l>And eat the game we captured just before.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Some might object and call these sinful joys,</l>
            <l>But all the world knows that boys <hi rend="i">will</hi> be boys,</l>
            <l>And those, who try to make of them staid men,</l>
            <l>Are too utopian in mortal ken ;</l>
            <l>For few of them, on whom a parent dotes,</l>
            <l>E'er fail to sow, and harvest, some wild oats,</l>
            <l>But who, in later years' experience,</l>
            <l>Enrich their homes with sweetest recompense.</l>
          </lg>


          <pb id="VAA9481-114" n="113"/>

          <lg>
            <l>And when in time to cadet size we grew,</l>
            <l>We donned a uniform, of white and blue,</l>
            <l>And shoulder'd musket or grappel'd a sword,</l>
            <l>And marched and countermarched, at given word;</l>
            <l>Bedecked with waving plumes, and trappings bright</l>
            <l>On gala days, when foes were not in sight,</l>
            <l>We kept quick step, to martial music's strain,</l>
            <l>As we charged up the hill and down again.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Music had charms for some of us, you know,</l>
            <l>And horn, flute, clarionet and piccalo,</l>
            <l>And drum made up our band, and oft we played</l>
            <l>At comp'ny drill, and midnight serenade</l>
            <l>To please a sweetheart, or admiring friend.</l>
            <l>The mem'ries of those times in beauty blend</l>
            <l>To guild life's journey, on its downward stream,</l>
            <l>And weave for us its most delicious dream.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And thus we passed youth's fleeting hours away</l>
            <l>Unfettered, save by pleasure's genial sway,</l>
            <l>Whose winning ways and deeply cunning skill</l>
            <l>The listless heart led captive at its will,</l>
            <l>Unminded of the changes sweeping by,</l>
            <l>Which often pained the heart, tear dimmed the eye;</l>
            <l>For all, as viewed through life's kaleidoscope,</l>
            <l>But charmed the mind and gave the bosom hope.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>But time passed on and youth to manhood changed;</l>
            <l>Our love for former sports became estranged,</l>
            <l>And joys, that once so sweetly thrilled the heart,</l>
            <l>Now seemed to be of mem'ry but a part,</l>
            <l>Like some dear, cherished dream of early love,</l>
            <l>Which fancy in its haunts of beauty wove,</l>
            <l>Whose glowing colors kissed the plastic mind</l>
            <l>And left their impress there in brightness shrined.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>No more the ball or marble gave delight;</l>
            <l>The chase and drill were now neglected quite,</l>
            <l>And things that once with pleasure's ray could warm</l>
            <l>The heart, and round it cast a witching charm,</l>
            <l>No more the bent of inclination swayed,</l>
            <l>Though in their bright accustomed garb arrayed;</l>
            <l>For mind now claimed its mission to fulfill,</l>
            <l>And make the passions subject to the will.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Neglected learning, now no longer deemed</l>
            <l>The phantom that the youthful fancy dreamed,</l>
            <l>Was to the eager mind a jewel bright,</l>
            <l>As wisdom shed its rays of glowing light,</l>
            <l>And bade us from its crystal fount drink deep,</l>
            <l>Where thought its richest, brightest trophies reap;</l>
            <l>Or, pointing to fair nature's book, outspread,</l>
            <l>Bade us its many golden pages read.</l>

            <l>For there the vale with its unnumbered flowers--</l>
            <l>The streams that sing away day's shining hours--</l>
            <l>The groves, amid whose boughs and trembling leaves</l>
            <l>The wind its sweetest songs of music weaves;</l>
            <l>The mountains tow'ring midst ethereal space--</l>
            <l>The ocean roaring at its rock-bound base,</l>
            <l> And sun, and moon, and stars are pages bright</l>
            <l>That thrilled the heart with ecstasy's delight.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Yes, as the mind, expanding, drank the lore</l>
            <l>From learning's fount, it thirsted still the more,</l>
            <l>As in the yearning soul were quickly wrought</l>
            <l>New hopes, and aims, inborn of heavenly thought;</l>
            <l>For, if we looked up to the sky above,</l>
            <l>Eternal wisdom there spake words of love;</l>
            <l>And, if we looked to earth and seas below,</l>
            <l>Eternal light crowned all with lustrous glow.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Sweet hours of life, dear pictures of the past !</l>
            <l>Like bright and softened hues that overcast</l>
            <l>The sky, when long the sun has sunk to rest</l>
            <l>And kissed the ocean of the distant west,</l>
            <l>Ye shine effulgent on the wistful eye,</l>
            <l>As memory relights youth's fading sky,</l>
            <l>And voices, that have long been hushed and still,</l>
            <l>Echo again, to make the heart-strings thrill.</l>
          </lg>


          <pb id="VAA9481-117" n="116"/>


          <lg>
            <l>But ah, dear friends, although 'tis sweet at times</l>
            <l>To look within the past, as its sweet chimes</l>
            <l>Re-echo in the heart, as erst they rang,</l>
            <l>When hope in dulcet tones its music sang;</l>
            <l>Yet there are scenes of sadness pictured there</l>
            <l>That call up oft the sympathetic tear,</l>
            <l>As some forgotten tone, or word, or look</l>
            <l>Is then recalled from mem'ry's hoarded book.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Yes, friends and pledged companions of my youth,</l>
            <l>Whose deeds were noble, and whose words were truth,</l>
            <l>Ere life's zenith was reached received death's doom,</l>
            <l>And slumber now, alas ! within the tomb.</l>
            <l>Earth seemed to them all beautiful and bright,</l>
            <l>And fancy robed each passing scene with light,</l>
            <l>But oh ! how vain the thought of length of years,</l>
            <l>Since hope's blest star but rose to set in tears.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Long, unreturning years, have passed away</l>
            <l>Since then, and left us but their hallowed clay,</l>
            <l>Whilst life's realities, midst light and shade,</l>
            <l>Upon our hearts, for weal or woe, have made</l>
            <l>Impressions strong as life; and yet we still</l>
            <l>Are striving to ascend that rugged hill,</l>
            <l>Whose summit eager thousands toil to gain</l>
            <l>Through life, but often toil, alas ! in vain.</l>

          </lg>
          <pb id="VAA9481-118" n="117"/>

          <lg>
            <l>But ever let our aims be good and high,</l>
            <l>Undaunted by the troubles rolling by,</l>
            <l>Though they be many and full often leave</l>
            <l>A sting within the heart, to sorely grieve,</l>
            <l>If we would reap a harvest full and rich,</l>
            <l>And have our names placed in the envied niche</l>
            <l>Of fame, and be remembered in the years</l>
            <l>To come, when life's last spark is dimmed by tears.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Yet, if we'd gain a name of wide renown,</l>
            <l>We must be good, as great, since virtue's crown</l>
            <l>Must give a setting, like the dome of night</l>
            <l>To stars, or else, though shrined in dazzling light</l>
            <l>Enough to win the world's admiring gaze,</l>
            <l>With none too famed to give it fulsome praise,</l>
            <l>The ages will its bright effulgence mar</l>
            <l>Until, to human sight, 'tis lost like pleiad star.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Still let us onward press with high resolve,</l>
            <l>For seeming hills that tow'r aloft dissolve</l>
            <l>Before the iron will, as dew-drops bright</l>
            <l>Exhaled at kiss of morning's genial light;</l>
            <l>The goal shines in the distance far, 'tis true,</l>
            <l>But those who perseveringly pursue</l>
            <l>Its paths, though darkling shadows overcast</l>
            <l>The way, may gain some glitt'ring prize at last.</l>

            <l>And fame is quite within the reach of all,</l>
            <l>Who would to her in wooing accents call,</l>
            <l>For those, alone, success impatient waits,</l>
            <l>Who would with effort open wide her gates.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>With progress thy triumphal car sweeps on</l>
            <l>Through cycling time, ladened with trophies won</l>
            <l>In life's great battle, and none can withstand</l>
            <l>Thy steppings, or escape thy plastic hand;</l>
            <l>And art and nature own thy regal sway,</l>
            <l>And with their choicest gifts bestrew thy way.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Oh, be for thee, the pleasing task and aim</l>
            <l>To re-enkindle Liberty's bright flame,</l>
            <l>Till it shall rise, like incense to the sky,</l>
            <l>The mind to light, the heart to purify;</l>
            <l>And all mankind in loving harmony</l>
            <l>Shall live, and in their pristine glory be.</l>

          <p rend="center">(Addressed to Mr. Isaac Wilson. and Hannah Decker Wilson, Olney,
            Illinois, Oct. 13, 1879.)</p>
          <lg>
            <l>We hail thee, groom and bride of fifty years !</l>
            <l>Who hand in hand, midst trials, hopes and fears</l>
            <l>Have journeyed down the stream of life, and still,</l>
            <l>In love and joy, thy youthful vows fulfill.</l>
            <l> Old time, unroll thy scroll and once again</l>
            <l>Reveal the joyous hours and moments when</l>
            <l>These hearts, united and in unison</l>
            <l>To love's sweet voice and touch, first beat as one!</l>
            <l>And, in the flight of years, oh, heaven, let this</l>
            <l>Be one, to them, of hallowed, wedded bliss,</l>
            <l>As friends and kindred, near and far away</l>
            <l>Now greet them on their golden wedding day.</l>
          </lg>


          <lg>
            <l>When twain you gave in troth the plighted vow,</l>
            <l>Surely the angels did, consenting, bow,</l>
            <l>For all along this half a hundred years</l>
            <l>Your smiles and joys have far outweighed your tears.</l>
            <l>Mercy and peace, with choicest blessings stored,</l>
            <l>Have crowned with plenty your domestic board ;</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-142" n="141"/>

            <l>And children have been given you to bless</l>
            <l>And cheer your latter days with happiness.</l>
            <l>You, best of husbands, you, the best of wives,</l>
            <l>We greet as groom and bride, God bless your lives,</l>
            <l>And in each heart shed love's delicious ray,</l>
            <l>To gild and crown your golden wedding day.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Oh ! may your years in future glide along</l>
            <l>As sweet as poet's dream or maiden's song;</l>
            <l>And care no deeper lines upon each brow</l>
            <l>Trace with his finger than are graven now ;</l>
            <l>And beauty's richest tints, from nature, borrow,</l>
            <l>To shrine the purest love of each to-morrow,</l>
            <l>As from hope's mountain, by prescience given,</l>
            <l>You view the twilight of the coming even;</l>
            <l>And, when time's measure to each one is filled--</l>
            <l>Your loving hearts to all below be stilled,</l>
            <l>Sweet Star of Bethlehem, let thy bright rays</l>

          <head rend="center">Evolution</head>


          <p rend="center">(Is it Fact or Fancy?)</p>

          <lg>
            <l>Who will deny this is a reasoning age,</l>
            <l>When we by it can trace our lineage</l>
            <l>Through high selection and development,</l>
            <l>Unhelped by revelation kindly sent,</l>
            <l>From man and woman, shaped in glorious forms,</l>
            <l>To bugs and fleas and loathsome, slimy worms?</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Time was when we were taught to act and think</l>
            <l>That there was no connecting common link</l>
            <l>Between the brute and human, but, alas !</l>
            <l>We find ourselves related to the ass;</l>
            <l>For did not he have such a brassy cheek</l>
            <l>In converse terse to brother Baalam speak?</l>
            <l>And though we fail our true kindship to find,</l>
            <l>The difference is in shape and not in kind.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Who can not some resemblance strong descry</l>
            <l>Between a lady and a butterfly,</l>
            <l>As she, full rigged, like vessel trimmed for sail,</l>
            <l>Throws all her frills and pinbacks to the gale,</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-144" n="143"/>

            <l>Regardless how the gallant top sail hangs,</l>
            <l>If it does not obscure her frizzled bangs,</l>
            <l>Bedecked with hues through art and nature's freaks,</l>
            <l>That oft outshine the paint upon her cheeks.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And don't the modern dandy, dressed to kill,</l>
            <l>Or wound his sweetheart 'neath her linen frill,</l>
            <l>Recall the plumage and the peacock strut,</l>
            <l>When each upon their backs their all have put,</l>
            <l>Unconscious that the crowd that round them gathers</l>
            <l>Is but attracted by their " fuss and feathers."</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And don't the dude, with natty hat and cane,</l>
            <l>Resemble much in walk and look, the crane,</l>
            <l>As he with stylish step and ogling stare,</l>
            <l>E'er keeps his weather eye upon the fair?</l>
            <l>He often flirts by way of a digression,</l>
            <l>And wonders if he has made an impression,</l>
            <l>When, really, at most, his strolling visit</l>
            <l>Calls forth the question only, Oh ! what is it?</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>A drummer's likeness, who can not discern,</l>
            <l>To elephant, which has his grub to earn?</l>
            <l>Each packs a <hi rend="i">trunk</hi>, in traveling to and fro,</l>
            <l>And <hi rend="i">quarters</hi> take, when to each town they go;</l>

            <pb id="VAA9481-145" n="144"/>

            <l>Both travel with a <hi rend="i">show</hi>, as you may see,</l>
            <l>And, if unchecked, when bent upon a spree,</l>
            <l>Although each one a different cause espouses,</l>
            <l>Are pretty sure in time to break their houses.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>That polly parrot and the politician</l>
            <l>Are much alike, 'twould take no wise logician</l>
            <l>To demonstrate, since seizing on the polls</l>
            <l>Each sees his <hi rend="i">footing's</hi> good, in all his roles;</l>
            <l>They well agree, in all their songs and meters.</l>
            <l>And often act their parts, as ward repeaters;</l>
            <l>For in each case, of squalling and of splutter,</l>
            <l>They have a common object-bread and butter.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And who, with keen perception can not draw</l>
            <l>Resemblance 'twixt the learned judge at law,</l>
            <l>And silent owl, with solemn face and eyes?</l>
            <l>Both put on dignity, and each looks wise;</l>
            <l>Both sit among the <hi rend="i">limbs</hi>, the one of trees,</l>
            <l>The other those of law, of all degrees;</l>
            <l>While each in doing justice to his cause</l>
            <l>Deals <hi rend="i">fowly</hi> often with the <hi rend="i">footed claws</hi>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And there are persons (be to them bad luck !)</l>
            <l>Who see between a doctor and a duck</l>
            <l>A likeness strong, and say, as proof to back it,</l>
            <l>That each has a propensity to quack it. </l>

            <pb id="VAA9481-146" n="145"/>

            <l>The charlatan of herbs and sugar pills</l>
            <l>Oft, like the duck, has <hi rend="i">flat</hi> and lengthy bills;</l>
            <l>And each in turn is often seen in quest</l>
            <l>Of down or gold to feather well his nest.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Behold ! e'en now, against our pride and wishes,</l>
            <l>Our lineage is traced way down to fishes,</l>
            <l>For pretty mermaids, living 'neath the waves,</l>
            <l>Flirting with beaux within their coral caves,</l>
            <l>In time may change their haunts for huts and gardens,</l>
            <l>And with their sisters sport the Dolly Vardens.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>The merman, will he common impulse mind,</l>
            <l>When he has not a tail to wag behind,</l>
            <l>And put on style and airs, like any other</l>
            <l>Big fish, evolved into a man and brother,</l>
            <l>Who has exchanged his drink--a common fate,</l>
            <l>For that of lager beer or whisky straight?</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>And thus we see through scientific glasses</l>
            <l>Some common traits developed by the masses</l>
            <l>Of human kind, and beasts, that otherwise</l>
            <l>Would seem inexplicable mysteries.</l>
            <l>But he who now the likeness can't discern</l>
            <l>Is thought too big a fool to live and learn.</l>
          </lg>



          <pb id="VAA9481-147" n="146"/>

          <lg>
            <l>Yes, sages, who in science deeply revel,</l>
            <l>Have found for creatures but a common level,</l>
            <l>And like a river, in its upward course,</l>
            <l>Blest evolution points the native source;</l>
            <l>And although it may tinge the cheeks with shame,</l>
            <l>We learn our destiny, and whence we came.</l>
            <l>With syllogistic trick, of cunning art,</l>
            <l>They prove all creatures had an even start,</l>
            <l>And when some, in improvement's onward race</l>
            <l>In nature's scale, secured the higher place,</l>
            <l>It was "selection," "blue glass," or mistake,</l>
            <l>That caused them all the new departure take.</l>
            <l>They set at naught, as false, God's wondrous plan,</l>
            <l>In holy writ outlined,--" Let us make man."</l>
            <l>They bridge their paths o'er the chaotic chasm</l>

            <l>But leave to chance, at some propitious hour,</l>
            <l>To give to it a vitalizing power.</l>
            <l>They say the protoplasm from protein came</l>
            <l>Through isomeric forms with upward aim,</l>
            <l>And mol'cules, by affinities arranged,</l>
            <l>As they in nature's crucible were changed.</l>
            <l>But whence the protein as thus combined,</l>
            <l>And all the elements which stand behind?</l>

            <l>Suppose that mankind first did take its start</l>
            <l>In cell and germ, each playing well its part,</l>
            <l>Until evolved in years to babyhood,</l>
            <l>Who furnished nurses for the little brood?</l>
            <l>Who made their beds at night, so warm and neat,</l>
            <l>And tucked the covers round their tiny feet?</l>
            <l>And when,from hunger,mamma they were calling,</l>
            <l>Who soothed and gave them milk to stop their squalling ?</l>
            <l>Pray, Doctor Darwin, who supplied the teas</l>
            <l>To cure their colds contracted in the breeze,</l>
            <l>When out upon a little picnic frolic,</l>
            <l>Or soothing syrup when they had the colic?</l>
            <l>Who taught their lisping tongues the human speech?</l>
            <l>Was it the moaning sea shell on the beach,</l>
            <l>Or echo notes, which through the forests rang,</l>
            <l>Where dwell the monkey and orang-outang?</l>
            <l>Of reason's light, who was the gracious giver?</l>
            <l>Does brain secrete a thought, as bile the liver?</l>
            <l>And do we find the little fellows springing</l>
            <l>Up through gradations time is ever bringing</l>
            <l>From lowest type of life to highest one,</l>
            <l>A daughter this to be, and that, a son?</l>
            <l>If so, by all means, let the fact be stated,</l>
            <l>And let the darlings all be cultivated.</l>
            <l>Then, by selection, or by evolution maybe,</l>
            <l>We all can boast a good and pretty baby,</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-149" n="148"/>

            <l>And grow it like a rose geranium,</l>
            <l>And stuff with sense its little cranium,</l>
            <l>That all the world may know that times have changed,</l>
            <l>And nature's laws are now by science ranged.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Suppose it took a million years to bring</l>
            <l>An element up to a living thing,</l>
            <l>Why can we not, in the transforming stages,</l>
            <l>Witness what others saw in ancient ages?</l>
            <l>Why can we not, in our own passing day,</l>
            <l>Perceive the great progressive laws at play,</l>
            <l>And see the embryotic germ of hen</l>
            <l>A new departure take, and hatch a wren?</l>
            <l>Or, in full term and time, bring forth to view</l>
            <l>An eagle, condor or a cockatoo?</l>
            <l>Or plastic fertile germ of horse or ass,</l>
            <l>Which does by chance through evolution pass,</l>
            <l>Become a little shining humming-bird,</l>
            <l>Or elephant, a Jumbo of the herd ?</l>
            <l>Now shall we say, to cover well the point</l>
            <l>Of failure, that these times are out of joint ?</l>
            <l>Ah, science has its garners fully loaded</l>
            <l>With baseless theories, by facts exploded.</l>
            <l>One year has launched imaginative schemes</l>
            <l>That proved the next but scientific dreams;</l>
            <l>So, when, in wisdom's deepest depths profound,</l>
            <l>The sages have at last the unit found,</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-150" n="149"/>

            <l>The utmost point of science has been reached,</l>
            <l>And all the sophistry that they have preached</l>
            <l>Then fails them, and compels a fatal pause,</l>
            <l>If they ignore a potent, great first cause ;</l>
            <l>For who but God, ye scientists, please tell,</l>
            <l>Could make the elements of germ and cell?</l>
            <l>We know we can a compound change at will</l>
            <l>Into its elements, with cunning skill,</l>
            <l>And, then, as easily can re-combine</l>
            <l>The same; yet these show not the hand divine,</l>
            <l>Save in unerring laws at first created,</l>
            <l>Which govern solid things and sublimated.</l>
            <l>In hydrogen and oxygen combined</l>
            <l>The compound water, we are sure to find :</l>
            <l>Yet at the chemist's skillful touch, 'tis true</l>
            <l>It may assume ethereal weight and hue;</l>
            <l>And, too, the crystal, with its clear cut faces,</l>
            <l>By solvents can be changed, so that no traces</l>
            <l>Are left to tell of former beauties bright,</l>
            <l>Reflected and refracted by the light.</l>
            <l>And still, through nature's fixed, unvar'ing laws</l>
            <l>So surely as effect does follow cause,</l>
            <l>This mass may yet that lovely form regain,</l>
            <l>If first conditions are assumed again.</l>
            <l>Not so with living cell and protoplast :</l>
            <l>Once changed they never more can be recast</l>
            <l>Into their former beings. From the dead</l>
            <l>No life can come, when vital spark has fled.</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-151" n="150"/>

            <l>What is that vital spark, and whence it came,</l>
            <l>Which warmed the living as with fiery flame?</l>
            <l>Was it but an electric current riven?</l>
            <l>Or was it soul, or spirit-life, God-given,</l>
            <l>Which unenvironed flew its heavenly way,</l>
            <l>Leaving its house of matter to decay?</l>
            <l>Then why the difference, we the savants ask,</l>
            <l>'Twixt dead and living matter? Solons meet the task.</l>
            <l>Through words revealed we have a clear solution ;</l>
            <l>Through wiseacres it's only evolution.</l>
            <l>If a creator is required at last,</l>
            <l>To form the elements of bioplast,</l>
            <l>Why go behind creative power revealed,</l>
            <l>To seek it in vague reason's mists concealed?</l>
            <l>The trouble is to bridge the boundless chasm</l>
            <l>'Twixt cell and ether with the protoplasm.</l>
            <l>Can't He, who could a nucleus create,</l>
            <l>As well make mankind in their high estate ?</l>
            <l>This epigram has lived for many days,</l>
            <l>The rule is poor that will not work both ways,</l>
            <l>And, if it be accepted as a truth,</l>
            <l>Then why may we not just as well, forsooth !</l>
            <l>Say Jocko lost his manhood for a cage,</l>
            <l>Since this is held as a degen'rate age?</l>
            <l>The origin of sin and Adam's fall</l>
            <l>Is no great mystery, if we but call </l>

            <pb id="VAA9481-152" n="151"/>


            <l>To aid deep science, in these latter days,</l>
            <l>When all the world with knowledge is ablaze,</l>
            <l>And higher critics soar on shining wings,</l>
            <l>And look askance at all intricate things;</l>
            <l>For now we know that circumstance deranges</l>
            <l>The course of matter with time's many changes,</l>
            <l>So that a creature, once of high degree and cast,</l>
            <l>Through retrograding scale, might crawl at last.</l>
            <l>Perhaps the serpent, which to Eve did speak,</l>
            <l>In nature was a metamorphosed freak.</l>
            <l>His cunning plot, alas! too well succeeded</l>
            <l>But for it lost its speech, and then receded</l>
            <l>Along the backward course of evolution</l>
            <l>(A barren recompense for honied elocution),</l>
            <l>Till now, at last, under the best auspices,</l>
            <l>It can but squirm, and crawl, and issue hisses.</l>
            <l>Can't Darwin see, in the descending scale,</l>
            <l>That mankind might at last evolve a tail,</l>
            <l>If circumstances were at all propitious</l>
            <l>To give them four legs, and a nature vicious,</l>
            <l>Since nature, in her various moods and ways,</l>
            <l>Full oft a downward tendency betrays?</l>
            <l>Then, taking as a truth the olden rule,</l>
            <l>Of double action, up and down, the school</l>
            <l>Of Darwin might have solved the problem clearly,</l>
            <l>Of extinct races which we learn of yearly,</l>
            <l>Of men, whose cities in our western land</l>
            <l>As monuments unto their genius stand, </l>

            <pb id="VAA9481-153" n="152"/>

            <l>But who could not successful warfare wage</l>
            <l>'Gainst a degenerate prehistoric age.</l>
            <l>Did they assume a higher type or did they change</l>
            <l>Their shapes and natures to a lower range ?</l>
            <l>In this dilemma science doth avail</l>
            <l>To trace the missing link to Spotted Tail,</l>
            <l>And to his many savage cousins full,</l>
            <l>From bad Geronimo to Sitting Bull,</l>
            <l>And all their nomad kindred, high and low,</l>
            <l>From painted chief to shaggy buffalo.</l>
            <l>In free development, reversed, we see,</l>
            <l>When left to chance and blind selection free,</l>
            <l>We might descend the scale to simpler forms</l>
            <l>Until we reach the level of the worms,</l>
            <l>And even lower, in the backward grade,</l>
            <l>If evolution lent its molding aid.</l>
            <l>If we review the times of long ago,</l>
            <l>And scan the ancient works of man, we know</l>
            <l>He then our equal was in many things,</l>
            <l>O'er which aesthetic taste still glamour flings,</l>
            <l>And see, upon the world's recording chart,</l>
            <l>That no advance has since been made in art,</l>
            <l>Or painting, or in architectural skill;</l>
            <l>For evidences dot each plain and hill</l>
            <l>To show that Africa and Asia then</l>
            <l>Gave to that age as wise, enlightened men</l>

            <l>Can give in this, our golden era day.</l>
            <l>Their monuments and palaces yet stand</l>
            <l>To testify of wisdom, genius grand,</l>
            <l>Whose reach and depth and breadth, in culture vast,</l>
            <l>In modern times have never been surpassed.</l>
            <l>What stopped blest progress in its upward work?</l>
            <l>Was it Egyptian or the turbaned Turk</l>
            <l>That turned the tide, with retrograding wheels,</l>
            <l>Until the map with deepest tints reveals</l>
            <l>A darkened Asia, and a darker Africa?</l>
            <l>Did evolution stop or go astray?</l>
            <l>E'en Greece and Rome's trancendent light</l>
            <l>Was overshadowed, as by stygian night,</l>
            <l>As crimes and ignorance usurped the sway,</l>
            <l>Where right and intellect once led the way.</l>
            <l>Whatever the new fangled doctrine does,</l>
            <l>With puffed up scholars, it creates a buzz,</l>
            <l>As they drink its philosophy and cant,</l>
            <l>Which do, to them, supply the long felt want;</l>
            <l>And, thus equipped, to all they shy a lance,</l>
            <l>Who won't believe that all things came by chance.</l>
            <l>They will admit that there are good and evil,</l>
            <l>Yet stubbornly ignore both God and devil;</l>
            <l>That Joshua really did make the sun</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Are matches made in heaven? Ah, no, not all,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">For circumstance and art and mammon do</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Much of the pairing of the world ; they who</l>
            <l>Mark not the fact are deaf to Cupid's call.</l>
            <l>Yet, when, contrariwise, some people seek</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The course of nature's plan to overthrow,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Success may follow for awhile, but woe</l>
            <l>And sorrow afterwards dire vengeance wreak.</l>
            <l>A monitor presides within the breast</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Of ev'ry mortal being with a soul,</l>
            <l>Restless, and vigilant, and e'er in quest</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Of some congenial spirit to console</l>
            <l>The aching heart, and give its longings rest,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And nothing else its cravings will control.</l>
          </lg>


          <lg>
            <l>To farthest verge marked by the night and day,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Ere blighting sin the human race had cursed,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The heav'nly orbs their courses run, as first</l>
            <l>Through space they started on their trackless way.</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-162" n="161"/>





            <l>So in accord with laws divinely made,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">When left to freely choose, all creatures mate,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And not by accident, which some call fate ;</l>
            <l>And thus through love is nature's will obeyed.</l>
            <l>Are laws which seem to govern earth and heaven</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Not made for man? Can he set them aside,</l>
            <l>When they for all creation's sum were given?</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Can he through station, pomp, or wealth, or pride,</l>

          <lg>
            <l>The wedding bells with silver tongues may ring</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Their merry chimes, the ear to charm and please,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And riches bring with them luxurious ease;</l>
            <l>But, oh, too oft they leave a poignant sting</l>
            <l>Where naught but joy seemed only due, for love</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Can not be bought with gold; respect at best</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Is all that mammon gains by rich behest--</l>
            <l>Affection pure it can not buy or move.</l>
            <l>Society, by artful charms, may win</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">With dazzling rays; but all its glamour soon</l>


            <pb id="VAA9481-163" n="162"/>


            <l>Wears off, as pleasures fade from gilded sin ;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And, even, fame the heart can not attune</l>
            <l>When mated not by love, for naught within</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">One answ'ring chord sends back to proffered boon.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Half hidden, Cupid, in his sylvan bower,</l>

            <l rend="ti-1">Peers at, with cunning glance, each passer-by,</l>
            <l>As bees peep from the petals of a flower,</l>
            <l>Op'ning with beauty to the dews and sun ;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And ready stands, with bended bow and dart,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Love-tipped, to pierce each sympathetic heart</l>
            <l>Exposed by mutual admiration won :</l>
            <l>And shy is lad or lass who can evade</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The shaft upon its fatal mission sent,</l>
            <l>Though oft the shot seems but at random made;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">For when he's on marauding conquest bent,</l>
            <l>The victim, dazed by blandishments displayed,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">At will surrenders, with a sweet consent.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Then let each lover's purest offerings,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Of deep devotion and of graces sweet,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Be placed on altar at the Sly God's feet,</l>
            <l>And he will fan the flame with downy wings </l>

            <pb id="VAA9481-164" n="163"/>




            <l>And make it burn the brighter, as the days</l>

            <l rend="ti-1">More closely sympathetic hearts and minds.</l>
            <l>Defying reason's subtle, cunning ways,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">When conscience shall give heed to Cupid's plea,</l>
            <l>Untrammeled by restraint of wealth or caste,</l>
            <l>And guided by affection sweet, and free,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">May we not hope ere many years be passed</l>
            <l>Mankind will wiser, purer, happier be,</l>

            <l>To make the paths of duty sure and plain,</l>
            <l>That conscience, tutored and enlightened, may,</l>
            <l>Environed and confined to thought's domain,</l>
            <l>Assist mankind the better to obey</l>
            <l>The law, and thus lost paradise regain.</l>

            <l>Oh! lady weep no more, but let me chase</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">From thy fair cheeks those crystal tears away,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That shine like sparkling dews, and now be gay;</l>
            <l>Although, as stealing down thy saddened face</l>
            <l>Their brightness adds another gentle grace</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To thy already winning charms, as they</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">With beauty gem, like pearls of purest ray;</l>
            <l>Yet with my lips I would those tears efface,</l>
            <l>As the bright dews are kissed from off the flowers</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">By morning's sun-lit breath. Cheer up, be calm:</l>
            <l>Heaven will disperse the cloud that round thee lowers,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And o'er thy troubled mind shed a sweet balm;</l>
            <l>And gently soothe thee, in thy deepest sorrow,</l>
            <l>And cause a brighter sky to gild the morrow.</l>

            <l>Heroic Cubans ! hard has been your fate,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Enslaved and slain by tyrant's stern command ;</l>
            <l>Be firm and of good cheer, and watch and wait,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">As your deliverance is near at hand.</l>
            <l>For soon Columb'a's sons will strike the blow,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That will forever end Spain's power for strife,</l>
            <l>Which e'er had brought you misery and woe,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And freedom give, the dearest boon of life.</l>
          </lg>


          <lg>
            <l>Americans ! ye men of noble sires,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Let mem'ries of your brothers on the Maine</l>
            <l>Rekindle in your breasts avenging fires</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That shall consume accurs'd, assassin Spain.</l>
            <l>To arms, ye brave ! unsheath your gleaming swords ;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">From peaceful rests take down your trusty guns,</l>
            <l>And from Columbia's shores drive dastard hordes</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And let them know you still are freedom's sons.</l>

            <l>In passing time her cruel, fiendish work</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Has kept apace with the revolving years,</l>
            <l>Outrivaling, in hellish deeds, the Turk</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Who, ghoul-like, thrived on human blood and tears.</l>
            <l>O'er western lands, in sweet religion's name,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Her banners have been raised but to deceive,</l>
            <l>And all who trusted have been brought to shame,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And left o'er sorrow's bitter cup to grieve.</l>
          </lg>


          <lg>
            <l>O'er fair Peru and fairer Mexico,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Her savag'ry and thirst for sordid gold</l>
            <l>Brought to the Incas and the Aztecs woe</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Too heavy for the human heart to hold.</l>
            <l>Her greed for conquest, like a rising flood</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Sweeping in billows o'er the coral strand,</l>
            <l>Baptized old Cuba in a sea of blood,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Leaving no soul to tell of " Fatherland."<ref id="ref_001" rend="super"

            <l>And yet, when centuries had passed away,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And a new race had made their homes to smile</l>
            <l>With love, again she comes in war array</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To lay in waste this beaut'ous, happy isle.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>On ev'ry southern wind that passes by</l>

            <l>While helpless mothers in keen anguish cry,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">As famine, gaunt and grim, stalks to and fro.</l>
            <l>Can these appeals for sympathy and aid</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Unheeded be at such colossal crime?</l>
            <l>Freemen ! avenge these wrongs, with ball and blade,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And fame will wreathe your brows in coming time.</l>
