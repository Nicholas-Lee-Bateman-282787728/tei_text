                    form the "boiling place," or falls. That observant tourist, Judge James Hall, was
                    impressed by this turbulence: "The ear is stunned with the sound of rushing waters: and the
                    sight of waves dashing, and foaming, and whirling among the rocks and eddies below, is grand and
                        fearful."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Through these rapids were three channels, the best of which was on the Indiana side, known as the
                    "Indian chute" or "shoot." Navigation was possible only in high
                    water, and only by a skillful pilot able to steer through a narrow passage fifteen feet wide between
                    outcroppings capable of ripping the hull out of a boat. Even then some mariners came to grief, as in
                    the disaster of April, 1807, when three ships attempted to run the rapids on a rise. The <hi rend="i">John Atkinson</hi> "bore down for the head grand shoot and passed handsomely
                    by, rubbing the rocks two or three times," but the <hi rend="i">Rufus King</hi> and <hi rend="i">Tuscarora</hi> piled up. "The apparent perilous situation of the crews and
                    gentlemen on board was dreadful; in ships without rudders or keels tumbling from rock to rock and
                    rolling from side to side… without a possibility of being relieved from the
                        shore."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Before the age of steam a boat was at the mercy of the
                    current; an upstream craft could get through only by paying out a line forward to some solid object
                    on shore, moving ahead hand over hand of all hands on board: a laborious method but sure unless the
                    line parted, as it sometimes did.</p>
            <p>Low water prevented all loaded boats, even of light draft, from negotiating the falls, and forced
                    boatmen to portage two miles between <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Shippers paid a handsome fee for cartage of cargo and for extra hands to tow the
                    unloaded boat over to the Indian chute or to reload on another craft at the opposite end. To save
                    labor and expense, skippers needed a safe channel around the falls.</p>

            <p>Early in the nineteenth century, Indiana and other citizens undertook there the first Hoosier canal
                    venture. A futile effort, confused, impeded by sectional and self-interest, it revealed that digging
                    a two-mile ditch was not so easy as the captain and the colonel had surmised. The instigator of this
                    project was General Benjamin Hovey, a land speculator from <placeName>

                            continuation of the peace of the western country. In times of civil commotion, it would have
                            been worth nothing to the stockholders; and if Burr had at that time, other views, and only
                            held up this scheme to the public, to lull suspicion, while his plans were maturing, he

                    else produced a plan or estimate of cost. In the spring of 1805 Burr and Wilkinson stopped at
                        <geogName>Ohio Falls</geogName>, where Wilkinson was said to have talked noisily about making a
                    fortune out of the canal, to have expressed doubts of Hovey's integrity, and voiced a hope
                    of enlisting the support of Governor William Henry Harrison.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> But the Governor
                    remained aloof, and whether Burr or Wilkinson took at the time any practical steps to further the
                    canal scheme is not known.</p>
            <p>Yet some among the canal associates must have bestirred themselves, for on August 6 when Hovey
                    presented to the Indiana legislature his petition for incorporation, it responded with a bill
                    approved on August 24 incorporating the Indiana Canal Company. A long act of incorporation implied
                    that canal men or lawmakers or both had given careful thought to the business. The law specified
                    that: the capital stock be twenty thousand shares at $50 each; the company might accept
                    from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    canal commence within nine months from the passage of the act and be completed by December 1, 1811;

            <p>Of that group another Burr ally was Davis Floyd. A successful lawyer and tavern keeper, he was a

                    filibuster and collected about forty muskets. Later indicted for treason, he escaped by a nolle
                    prosequi; locally indicted for high misdemeanor, he was convicted, fined $10, and jailed
                    for three hours. If he lost caste with the Governor, he remained popular with legislators who, while

                    powerful feelings for and against. Aided by staunch friends and assailed by bitter enemies, Burr
                    moved continually in an aura of glamour and brimstone.</p>
            <p>Perhaps Burr took advantage of the liberal canal charter to induce company directors to organize a
                    bank for issuing promissory notes and to buy stock in the <placeName>

                    Burr's purposes, whatever they were. Nevertheless, if beneath the surface of canal affairs
                    were the muffled indirection and murky motives typical of Burr, some directors and onlookers
                    believed that the company expected to dig a canal. By October, 1805, subscriptions had risen to
                    $120,000 "subscribed by men of the first standing in the Union,"
                    according to Josiah Espy. He went on to say: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The spirit of enterprise was not dead in Indiana, but only collecting itself. If some farmers were
                    ignorant and indolent, if some distillers could not produce more whiskey than they needed
                    themselves, the Indiana potential was yet good. With the coming of statehood, <geogName>Ohio
                    Falls</geogName> canaling got its second wind. By the time Governor Jonathan Jennings delivered his
                    message to the first state legislature on November 7, 1816, Hoosier canal advocates were ready for
                    another try. This time they were mainly residents of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, they were not diverted by conspiratorial plots, and they plainly intended to dig a
                    canal. The leaders were John Bigelow and Samuel Beach. On January 3, 1817, they obtained from the
                    legislature a charter for the <geogName>Ohio Canal</geogName> Company to be incorporated with a
                    capital stock of $1,000,000, twenty thousand shares at $50 each. Liberal
                    provisions conferred power of eminent domain, allowed the company to double the capital, permitted
                    it to receive donations from the <placeName>

                    and specified that the job be finished by December 1, 1822. A less liberal provision fixed by
                    legislative action definite canal tolls. The act named as directors Bigelow, Beach, James Lemon,

            </p>
            <p>A complication occurred at a July meeting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, when it developed that speculators (whether within the company or outside is not
                    clear) were buying land on the proposed canal route with a view of profiting at the expense of the
                    company. This disclosure, added to lack of plan and estimate, led <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> subscribers to withhold their subscriptions and to appoint a committee to engage an
                    engineer "to examine the obstructions in the bed of the river at the falls, to ascertain
                    the practicability of removing them, and the probable expense of doing it."<hi rend="sup">66</hi>

            <p>It is strange that these technicalities of plan and estimate, which should have preceded all other
                    effort, should only so belatedly have been considered. A few months later the news was that Captain

                    than the company's engineer should have done these tasks is as puzzling as other haphazard
                    aspects of this undertaking. Still, the notice referring to Green is the first specific one
                    mentioning plan or estimate and came nine months after the company had been incorporated;

                    </quote>Starting a canal without bottles or kegs was as unthinkable as launching a cruiser without
                    champagne. At noon on May 3, company directors, each carrying a shovel, marched to the canal site,
                    where they simultaneously dug. The assembled crowd, described by the Corydon <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Gazette</hi> as "a large number of citizens," seized shovels and followed suit
                    with loud huzzas. At 2:00 P.M. everybody "repaired to a bower, prepared on a charming
                    green, in sight of the Canal," where Ethan Stone, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, delivered "an animated and patriotic address." After that all fell
                    to on "an elegant and sumptuous repast, prepared for the occasion by Maj. Charles
                    Futter." Pervading the occasion, said the paper, were "harmony, conviviality and
                    good fellowship… and everything exhibited a spirit of generous emulation in promoting
                    this great National work, destined to be one of the strongest cements of our union and common
                        prosperity."<hi rend="sup">74</hi>

            <p>Thus digging began in a blaze of hope, and for a time thereafter the contractor, Michael I. Myers,
                    busily grubbed out a section in <placeName>

                    </placeName> between Spring Street and the corner post of the town allotment and dug about a mile of
                    shallow ditch. The company engineer conceived the ingenious scheme of damming Cane Run, turning the
                    water into the canal ditch and washing out the earth, thus materially reducing the cost of
                    excavation. The idea was clever, but a stratum of blue clay defeated him. Sixty years later a local
                    historian said: "The waters carried out a small quantity of loose dirt, but when the blue
                    clay was reached had no effect, and had it continued running to this day would not have made a
                        canal."<hi rend="sup">75</hi>

                    Indiana, when confirmed believers were convinced that faith and determination could move mountains.

                    publish the blanks—scotched rumors that the lottery had been suspended and spurred on
                    chance-takers by such urgings as: "Adventurers, be on the alert, or you will miss a fortune
                    by unpardonable negligence."<hi rend="sup">86</hi> Nobody made a fortune, for the highest

                    for it was a dismal failure. Of 2,716 tickets sold, 1,497 were sold on credit, and lottery managers
                    had turned over to the company treasury only $2,536.<hi rend="sup">87</hi> By the end of

                    far short of the capitalization of $1,000,000, and only a small part of that was cash.

                            "4[00] to 600 dollars per Barge or Steam Boat" for a canal. But when they

            </byline>
            <p>Two installments of the minutes of the board of trustees of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University have previously been published in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi> (December, 1958, and September, 1959) and cover meetings held from December, 1806,
                    to December, 1811. Taken together, these two installments of the board's transactions
                    during the five years following the school's incorporation provide a broad view of the
                    problems and policies involved in transplanting a "seed of culture" from the
                    Atlantic seaboard to the Old Northwest at the beginning of the nineteenth century. At the end of
                    five years a three-story brick building stood ready for occupancy and in a sense symbolized both the
                    achievements and frustrations experienced by the board in its efforts to transform a congressional
                    land grant into a "seminary of learning."</p>
            <p>Proceeding upon a trial-and-error basis, a distinguished group of men had given time and support to
                    the school's interests: William Henry Harrison, a future president of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, served as president of the board and chairman of the committee charged with selling
                    and leasing land; Waller Taylor, one of Indiana's first two <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senators, "managed" an unsuccessful lottery designed to raise
                    $6,000 for the building fund; Jonathan Jennings, who was to be first governor of the
                    state of Indiana, served for a time as clerk of the board; one of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>' first two <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senators, Jesse B. Thomas, contracted for materials and labor for the building. A dozen
                    other men nearly as prominent in Indiana's territorial and state history and equally
                    dedicated to the school's success assumed comparable responsibilities as board members.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the board's most significant discovery during those early years was the fact that
                    necessary alterations in the physical dimensions of the first building were paralleled <list type="footnotes">

                    educational "blueprints" which most of the board's members had carried
                    west with them. For example, it became obvious that before an Eastern-style
                    "university" could prosper on the frontier a reservoir of scholars had first to be
                    created. This realization led to the opening of both a "common English school" and
                    a "Grammar school," for which an elaborate set of rules was drawn up and adopted
                    by the board in 1811. Considering the number and nature of the problems which the early board faced,
                    the erection of a brick building and the opening of preparatory schools within a period of five
                    years seemed grounds for the optimistic belief that a "Western nursery of
                    statesmen" was taking root in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the eve of the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>The following installment of the minutes, covering the period from 1812 to 1824, spans a significant
                    era in the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, whose fortunes were at many points affected by the larger trends and forces
                    of state and national history. Thus, the War of 1812 brought about a dispersal of several of the
                    original and most influential members of the board of trustees. The "Great
                    Migration" of the war and postwar years, on the other hand, carried a large number of
                    easterners to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> area and several of them, graduates of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Yale, became members of the board. The "land craze" of the years
                    preceding the Panic of 1819 was reflected in the board's confidence in its ability to sell
                    for $10 an acre school lands which had brought only $2 or $3 an
                    acre before the war. The board blamed the land policy of the national government for at least part
                    of the school's financial failure.</p>
            <p>Among factors of an "extraneous" nature which affected <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, the determining one in making these years a "dark age"
                    for the school was the relative decline in importance of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> itself. A very perceptive anonymous writer in the Western Sun (February 16, 1822) noted
                    both the origins and effects of the city's decline. During the French period it had
                    "grown rapidly under the profits of the fur trade." Later, "under the
                    Americans" <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> became "the grand central point of emigration and the seat of government for
                    the Northwest territory," and as a "frontier town, and a consequent military post,
                    she enjoyed the advantage of large sums expended by the general government." <pb n="313" id="VAA4025-057-4-039"/> Moreover, when the city was "located by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as a place for issuing supplies to the Indians, great advantages were reaped from the
                    consequent trade," and, finally, while <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> was "situated on the great leading route of western emigration, she received
                    from this source alone considerable sums of money and a constant increase of inhabitants."
                    All these favorable conditions, however, were "now [1822]… sadly reversed. More
                    than one third of our dwelling houses are destitute of inhabitants, our population has decreased
                    nearly or quite one half.… Buildings that a few years ago rented for two or three hundred
                    per annum, can now be rented for 50 or $100—many can be had for
                    occupying."</p>
            <p>Between 1812 and 1824 the university's early promise was to a comparable degree and for
                    closely related reasons "sadly reversed" also. When <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> ceased to be the "grand central point of emigration," the possibility
                    of leasing university land as a fund-raising measure disappeared and was finally abandoned. The
                    interruption in the "constant increase in inhabitants" undoubtedly helped to
                    deprive the school of a population base large enough and financially able to support it. The
                    transfer of the territorial capital from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Corydon reflected the declining influence in Indiana political affairs of the "<placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    the sale of those lands to the projected "state seminary" at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. One point is clear: the "trouble" with <placeName>

                    </placeName> University during this period cannot be explained solely in terms of loss of the land
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName> to the future Indiana University. To do so is to assign fundamental importance to a
                    development which was actually a symptom of deep-seated historical forces which had been at work on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and, indirectly, on the university.</p>
            <p>During the dozen years covered by the following minutes the board is seen in its various attempts to
                    carry forward the work begun before 1812 and to meet new challenges, only some of which are
                    suggested above. Desperately needed financial resources were sought unsuccessfully in several <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-057-4-040"/> petitions to Congress "praying" for
                    permission to sell additional land in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName>. Maintenance of the university building (and the "erection of two small houses
                    of convenience for the use of the Scholars, on the University lot") involved protracted
                    negotiations over labor and supplies. Nearly constant attention had to be given the problem of
                    finding students and retaining teachers for the "Grammar school." Changes in
                    curriculum and in tuition rates required board consideration, possibly in response to the large
                    number of "academies" and other private schools which sprang up in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the postwar years. These schools, ranging from "female"
                    boarding schools to night schools for apprentices, were conducted by individual schoolmasters (and
                    schoolmistresses), Protestant ministers, and the Catholic clergy and must have cut into the
                    university's grammar school enrollment. Such competition no doubt figured in the
                    board's decision in 1823 to turn over part of the university building to "the
                    Revd. Henry M. Shaw… and his successors, Episcopal clergymen" on the condition
                    that they "repair the Edifice… [and] attend to the education of youth.
                    " It was Shaw's school which was converted into the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> Seminary in 1824.</p>
            <p>By 1824, as the minutes and relevant footnotes below will indicate, the status of the board of
                    trustees and the charter provisions of the university itself had been significantly altered as a
                    result of a series of laws passed by the Indiana General Assembly. In 1820 the board's
                    control over rental income from the "seminary lands" in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName> was transferred to a state-appointed collector. Two years later, control over the land
                    was vested in a board of commissioners and the proceeds from its sale were reserved for the
                    "benefit of the state Seminary [at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>]." In January, 1824, the "university" was
                    "adopted" as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> Seminary and the board of trustees acted for a short time as the governing board for
                    the new institution. The terminal date of this installment (April, 1824), then, may be taken as the
                    close of the first era of the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University. After nearly two decades the school's experience was a case
                    history of both the "respect for learning" which the migrating easterner carried
                    West and the "obstacles to culture" which he found upon his arrival. Needless to
                    say, the ideal of such a university persisted and had sufficient vitality to make <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    obtaining an active fund for the benefit of the Institution, the Board of Trustees, conformably to
                    the provisions of the act of Incorporation, offerred to lease, in quarter sections the remaining
                    part of the Township— The Country however must be settled, &amp; improvements
                    considerably advanced, before any reliance can be placed on a fund derived from that source. Those
                    possessing the means, will purchase; others confiding in the indulgence of the Government,<hi rend="sup">37</hi> will spread themselves along the frontiers on the public lands; &amp;
                    thousands now prefer the latter, to a lease on liberal terms of the land appropriated for the use of
                    the University. Few leases being taken, &amp; believing the arrangement likely to prove
                    unproductive, at least for many years, the Board have for the present abandoned the measure. Having
                    no other means than the prices of Tuition for the support of Teachers, the Board have been able to
                    open a grammar school only, &amp; many years must elapse, before such a number of schollars will
                    offer, as would justify the employment of Teachers in the various &amp; higher branches of
                    literature &amp; philosophy. Had the Board the ability of procuring a competent library
                    &amp; philosophical apparatus, &amp; of supporting the necessary professors, the Institution
                    might shortly be rendered respectable &amp; advantageous to the country— This
                    desirable object can only be attained by the sale of the Seminary land, from which a fund might be
                    immediately realized, without impairing or hazarding the principal; that would be amply sufficient
                    for all the purposes of a useful &amp; splendid establishment— Your Petitioners would

                    Opperation.— That quantity of land has been sold, and the proceeds expended in the

            <p>Your Memorialists would further respectfully represent that under the authority of the Act of

            <p>Thus, in brief, the affairs of the seminary stood, when in the Autumn of Eighteen hundred &amp;
                    seventeen, the Board were induced to make application to your honorable Body for authority to sell
                    the remaining part of the aforesaid Township of land, and invest the proceeds of the sale in some
                    active Bank stock, the annual dividends of which might be expended in putting the Institution into
                    immediate and useful operation— And your Memorialists beg the indulgence of your
                    honorable Body, while they thus early renew this application, and while they attempt to state the
                    reasons which have induced them to it— And they are encouraged to this measure from the
                    consideration that all the reasons in favor of such a course at that time, are now encreased in a
                    duplicate ratio, &amp; that many reasons are added to those which at that time existed. Our

                    the sale of these lands would, even at this time, create a fund amply sufficient for all the
                    purposes contemplated by Congress, or could they believe that such a measure would impair the

                    consideration that does away [with] one of the principal objections urged to the measure by the
                    committee of the Senate to whom this subject was referred at the last session of Congress.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Such a precausion will effectually prevent any unwarrantable sacrifice in the

                    are committed upon the most valuable of this timber. Your Memorialists need hardly suggest the idea
                    that this circumstance will not only prevent an encrease of the value of these lands, but must
                    gradually diminish this value—a circumstance which the utmost vigilance of your
                    Memorialists will not be able to prevent. Your Memorialists do not indulge the expectation that they

                    Although the author emphasizes the history of tidewater <placeName>

            <p>To this reviewer at least, these two volumes afford much information to indicate that the successful

                    inevitable development from colonial experience. In fact, they strengthen the impression that the
                    Old Dominion exhibited important elements favorable to its becoming an independent country rather
                    than a part of the <placeName>

               </hi> is desirable—perhaps even required—reading for persons
                    with serious interest in the early history of the American Middle West. This is true not only
                    because a significant proportion of the early settlers of the Middle West were either natives of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> or descendents thereof but equally true because the most important problems faced by
                    the pioneers of the Middle West had previously been faced by Virginians—conflict with
                    Indians, the impact of the frontier, the necessity for much self-sufficiency, the organization of
                    local government, the development of transportation facilities, and so on. To a substantial extent,
                    the life and institutions of the early American Middle West was bottomed upon English life and
                    institutions <hi rend="i">as modified by Virginians.</hi> Thus, in various respects the founding of
                    Jamestown in 1608 is a more important part of Indiana's history than La Salle's

                    bibliographies are included. The author seems aware that local history cannot be written in a purely
                    local context, but his two volumes illustrate how essential such studies are to an adequate

            <p>Professor Caruso has continued a study of the frontier which he began in <hi rend="i">The Appalachian
                        Frontier.</hi> This volume on the Great Lakes frontier deals with a century and three-quarters
                    of the history of the Old Northwest from the arrival of Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette at Green
                    Bay to the admission of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> as a state. In twelve lengthy chapters the author has condensed a staggering amount of
                    frontier history into this book. There is nothing especially new in either his organization or
                    approach. His research nevertheless was extensive, giving his study a marked degree of
                    dependability. He has attempted to produce an account of the vigorous American thrust into the
                    Northwest which is at once compressed and readable. The compression has been done with highly
                    acceptable skill, and the writing is facile, even if at moments it appears strained. For instance,
                    Caruso refers to "sputtering" rifles (p. 369), and there are other such figures
                    which seem miscast. Nevertheless the text flows on with interest.</p>
            <p>There is an extensive chapter on the formation and administration of Indiana Territory which centers
                    largely about the cardinal issue of whether or not slavery would exist there. Jonathan Jennings is
                    treated as a central figure who stirred opposition to slavery and who saw the territory created free
                    as a sort of personal triumph.</p>
            <p>The entire Northwest was involved in the vaguities of American Indian policies, a trial and error
                    approach to much of its settlement, an involved relationship with Great Britain, and the rising
                    pressures of partisan politics. The Indian problem was central in the early phases of territorial
                    expansion. From the arrival of white men along the Great Lakes to the end of the Black Hawk War the
                    region was troubled with threats and conflicts. The Shawnee chieftain Tecumseh was to leave an
                    impression on the early Northwest almost comparable to that of George Clark and William Henry
                    Harrison. Like Glenn Tucker, Mr. Caruso looks upon the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> as an indecisive skirmish which "made <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>—a mere border skirmish that settled nothing—one of the great
                    victories in American history. In twenty-nine years it grew so big that it won Harrison the
                    presidency of the <placeName>

            <p>The War of 1812 was, in the eyes of the author, a frontier war which the East had to accept. In a
                    search for virgin soil the frontiersmen felt they had to have free access to the sprawling
                    Northwest. The war treated here is the same struggle which has been described many times before.
                    Little new has been added in this text. But Professor Caruso launches out into lush if not virgin
                    territory in his discussion of the Americanization of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>

                    his associates. Especially good are the passages drawn from the writings of Henry R. Schoolcraft.</p>

                    There is an extensive and carefully classified bibliography. The amount of original material

                    </placeName>, it is surprising that no one from that state has previously published a complete
                    account of these engagements. Now G. Glenn Clift, assistant director of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Society, has written a book on the subject, using as its title the battle
                    cry American troops used after the disaster at the Raisin.</p>
            <p>If enthusiasm had been enough, the Kentuckians would have annihilated the enemies of their country.
                    General orders for mobilization quickly produced volunteers beyond the state's quota, and
                    Brigadier General James Winchester, appointed by the president to command the western forces, went
                    to work with a will. Preparation and organization took time. On August 3, Governor Charles Scott
                    received an order from the secretary of war to send fifteen hundred infantry to the support of
                    General William Hull at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In spite of earnest endeavor, it was not until August 19, three days after
                    Hull's surrender, that the detachment set out for <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>All sorts of difficulties slowed the march of the relief column. Indian forays, building of forts,
                    lack of food and clothing, shortages of arms and munitions, and a diversion to relieve <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, besieged by Indians, caused many delays. Besides, militiamen were not easy to manage.
                    Animosity toward General Winchester caused a near mutiny, and only the appointment of their hero,
                    William Henry Harrison, as major general in command of the Northwestern Army satisfied the
                    Kentuckians that they would be properly led.</p>
            <p>Harrison ordered Winchester to the Rapids of the Maumee to establish a base for an advance to
                    Frenchtown (now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>

                    snow, and insufficient food, the Kentuckians reached the rapids on January 10, 1813. After Frenchmen
                    from the settlement had begged for protection from marauding British and Indians, Winchester on
                    January 17 ordered a detachment of 660 officers and men to the Raisin. The author describes in
                    detail the victorious action of January 18, the defeat of January 22 in which Winchester, who had
                    advanced with reinforcements, was captured, the massacre on the twenty-third, and the fate of the
                    prisoners who had been taken to Fort Maiden.</p>

            <p>The subject of this book, "the concept of Jacksonian democracy," is neither
                    political nor social democracy in the Jacksonian period nor the Jacksonian Democratic party, but a
                    set of six propositions based on the idea that the Democrats and "the opposing
                    party" of the 1830's and 1840's were in leadership, mass support,
                    ideology, and program the agents of certain socioeconomic classes and social groups. The study is an
                    attempt, according to Benson, to answer two specific questions: What empirical phenomena can
                    logically be designated by the concept? Does the concept help us to understand the course of
                    American history after 1815? As the concept is not defined until the last chapter (p. 329) the
                    unwary reader may at first be misled in earlier chapters by the author's apparent search
                    for evidence that might give substance and meaning to the Democratic party as an institution or to
                    democracy as a form of political behavior. The search is, in fact, a much narrower although detailed
                    examination of evidence to validate five of the six propositions. Benson has studied partisan
                    newspapers, party platforms, <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-057-4-099"/> and other party propaganda on
                    major public issues and the "images" of various parties and has sought to relate
                    them to the numbers of votes cast for various party tickets in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> chiefly from 1834 to 1844. In later chapters correlations are sought between the
                    numbers and proportions of votes cast and certain "quantified" economic, social,
                    cultural, ethnic, and religious characteristics of the population. The author's conclusions
                    are forthright: the underlying assumptions of historians who accept "the term and concept
                    of Jacksonian Democracy" are, at least for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, untenable; and the concept of Jacksonian Democracy has obscured rather than
                    illuminated the course of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> history after 1815. His findings are, in brief, iconoclastic.</p>
            <p>Benson recognizes only three approaches to the study of American politics in this period: first, the
                    hypotheses of Beard and Turner with their later modifications; second, the "metaphysical
                    notions about the country's `divine democratic mission,' or the `peculiar
                    political genius of the Teutonic race'" (p. 272); and third, "`chaos
                    floating into chaos'" (p. 272). He ignores other approaches of the past hundred
                    years: the search to discover how Americans governed themselves, who participated, at what levels,
                    to what extent, at what times, in what ways, for what purposes, and with what consequences for
                    themselves and for others; the role of "the court house gang"; the changing nature
                    of political leadership. The "general theory of voting behavior" which he
                    elaborates is not a general theory but a hypothetical statistical correlation that diverts attention
                    from basic questions such as what was the significance of voting. He neglects fundamental problems
                    involved in the formation of party platforms, party tickets, and political parties themselves and
                    the functions of those institutions in American society. Heavily weighted with arithmetic and
                    ideology, the study seems lifeless, abstract, and unreal.</p>
            <p>Within the limits Benson set for himself his book is an outstanding work of destructive criticism,
                    the removal of debris that historians need to do before they begin to write. It seriously weakens
                    the arguments presented by followers of the Simons-Beard-Hacker school and to some extent those of
                    Turner disciples without touching the main stream of Jacksonian studies. Its positive contributions
                    are negligible.</p>

                    and as a teacher and administrator who made a powerful impact on the emergence of basic research as

                    Vance probably believes that the publications listed have amply covered the story. If so, he is
                    mistaken because, even with many sources not mentioned, it is true that no book has yet been
                    published that adequately explains the American university as a public service institution,
                    particularly that aspect of it vaguely called "university extension" and
                    "adult education," both of which are often met with scorn by academic pundits,
                    neglected by administrators, and little understood by the public. Most Americans regard universities
                    as either ivory towers or colleges for the young. Vance recognizes the significance of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Idea as revolutionary but almost dismisses that evaluation when he says, "More
                    concise, less grand in conception, equally illuminating, was the oft-quoted comment of a <placeName>

                    was something for me'" (p. 204). Perhaps when the biographies of L. E. Reber, W.
                    L. Lighty, and other early representatives of the university extension movement are written, the
                    service function of universities may be illuminated as a true revolution. <placeName>

                    research; the combination signals a highly important development of American universities.</p>
            <p>Two episodes of curious interest are here worthy of note because they are related to the acute

                    system to the Promised Land of freedom" (p. 2). The legend had its origin in the ante
                    bellum period, but it reached its greatest flowering in reminiscences and memoirs published in the
                    generation following the Civil War. Later it was incorporated into many works of history as well as
                    fiction. Among historians, William H. Siebert did most to perpetuate the legend. In his numerous
                    writings Siebert relied heavily upon the reminiscences of former abolitionists and their
                    descendants. In his critical and scholarly little book Gara has used many of the materials which
                    Siebert collected but has come to different conclusions than Siebert did.</p>
            <p>Gara finds that the legend of the underground railroad, like most legends, contains some elements of
                    truth but also much exaggeration and folklore. His conclusions are not particularly startling, and
                    some of them have been anticipated by other historians, but his is the first systematic examination
                    of the legend. Briefly summarized his findings are as follows.</p>
            <p>First of all, there was no tightly knit organization on a national scale dedicated to helping slaves
                    escape, but there were a few localities in which there was a flourishing underground
                    railroad—as, for example, in eastern Indiana where Levi Coffin was active. Not all slaves
                    who ran away tried to come North. Some sought relatives or friends in the South or ran away and hid
                    to escape punishment. The number who actually reached the free states or <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> was very small. The legend emphasized the daring and heroism of the white conductors of
                    the railroad rather than that of the slaves. In the revised version which Gara gives us,
                    "the abolitionists play a less important part and the escaping slaves a more important
                    one…" (p. 18). Slaves who escaped were likely to be those who were most
                    intelligent and who had had the greatest educational advantages. They usually made the break for
                    freedom on their own initiative and were largely self-reliant. Expectation of assistance from white
                    abolitionists in the North played little or no part in the decision of most slaves to try to escape.
                    In fact, slaves often were unaware of any organization in the North which might help them. The
                    escapees usually headed, when possible, for the homes of Negroes who might lend them aid. Obviously
                    the most difficult and <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-057-4-102"/> dangerous part of the escape involved
                    travel through slave states. Such aid as white abolitionists rendered was available only after the
                    most hazardous part of the fugitive's journey was accomplished.</p>
            <p>By no means all abolitionists supported underground railroad activities. Although they were usually
                    ready to help an individual fugitive who happened to come their way, many abolitionists looked
                    askance at efforts to entice slaves to escape, preferring to use legal rather than illegal means to
                    gain their ends. Moreover, many of them felt that assistance to fugitives did not really weaken the
                    institution of slavery, which was their real objective. Nevertheless the fugitive slave issue,
                    especially after the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, and the sight of runaway slaves were powerful
                    factors in converting northerners to antislavery views.</p>

            <p>The title of this book is taken by its author from the characterization which Horace Greeley
                    derisively made of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Peace Conference. It was, in fact, largely an old man's convention as measured
                    by the standards of longevity in those days, for out of the 132 delegates who actually attended,
                    only seven were under forty years of age and twelve were seventy or more.</p>
            <p>Representatives from twenty-one states met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> on February 4, 1861, for the purpose of applying in the sectional dispute that old
                    American custom of compromising, which had saved the day on several important occasions in the past.
                    But as Professor Hesseltine notes in his Foreword, extremists in both North and South had passed
                    beyond the point where they were willing to give and take.</p>
            <p>Though a convention to compromise sectional difficulties had been suggested as early as the summer of
                    1860, nothing concrete developed until <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> called for such a convention in January, 1861; but the very day on which the delegates
                    assembled in Willard's Hotel Hall there also assembled in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Montgomery</region>, <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
               </placeName>, delegates
                    who were soon to organize the Confederate <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of America. Although some leaders who were setting up the Confederacy were willing to
                    re-enter a "reconstructed" Union, it was now late in the day for compromise.</p>
            <p>Of the twenty-one states that sent delegates to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, only six were slave states, and all of the free states were not represented.

                    </placeName> sent no delegates, and the Pacific states were too far away to attend. There was no
                    chance of the convention working out a compromise that would be accepted by northern and southern
                    extremists, who in reality were largely in charge of the destinies of the country, although there is
                    a general opinion among historians, shared by the author of this book, that a majority of the people
                    in both North and South would have accepted a compromise—the compromise that the
                    convention worked out or the Crittenden Compromise, <pb n="377" id="VAA4025-057-4-103"/> which had
                    been devised but not accepted in the Senate. Both the Peace Convention Compromise and the Crittenden
                    Compromise were in essence largely similar—both dealing only with the slavery issue, and
                    if adopted either would have become the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>
            <p>The author, Professor Gunderson, of Indiana University's Department of Speech and Theatre,
                    has as a sort of underlying theme which he in no wise belabors, the importance of propaganda,
                    oratory as well as the printed word, in capturing men's hearts and souls. The extremists
                    worked it overtime. Though there were economic issues more fundamental than slavery, yet people
                    could be emotionalized over slavery easier than over any other issue. The moderates or conservatives
                    failed to employ devices to capture people's emotions. This study, based on a widespread
                    search of newspapers, manuscript collections, as well as the records of the convention, offers a
                    valuable approach to the outbreak of the Civil War as well as an excellent analysis of the
                    convention and its activities.</p>

                    </placeName>'s attack at Harpers Ferry and the surrender of Major Anderson at Fort Sumter.
                    To arrange and present a meaningful account of the politics and people of that period is the
                    objective of <hi rend="i">Prologue to Sumter.</hi> In this work, which is a collection of excerpts
                    from writings pertinent to his topic, Editor Stern draws from diaries, official records, newspapers,
                    and several secondary works. In the main, he chooses well from the mass of materials concerning the
                    ominous period under consideration.</p>
            <p>In each of the twelve sections of <hi rend="i">Prologue to Sumter</hi> Stern builds up suspense about
                    the fate of the Union as he presents through the words of historians, soldiers, statesmen, and plain
                    folk what was occurring in the North and the South as the two areas drifted helplessly into a
                    brothers' war. Often these accounts are skillfully arranged to bring into sharp focus the
                    theme of a section, building toward the climax at Sumter. This is particularly true of the sections
                    entitled "The Union is Dissolved," "Storm over the White House,"
                    and "The Rack of Indecision." It is unfortunate that the section dealing with the
                    South's preparation for war is not broader in scope to include more of what was going on in
                    the several southern states.</p>

            <p>A companion piece to Stern's <hi rend="i">Sumter</hi> is his <hi rend="i">Soldier Life in
                        the Union and Confederate Armies.</hi> In this work he presents selections from previously
                    published reminiscences of two former soldiers who wrote of their Civil War experiences. Of the two
                    authors, the Union veteran Billings overshadows ex-Confederate McCarthy in his descriptions of what
                    it meant to be a soldier. The McCarthy work gives clearly the viewpoint of a lost cause; yet this
                    fact is not fully noted by Stern, who chooses not to include portions of the McCarthy work that make
                    this theme quite clear. Stern's selections of portions of McCarthy's and
                    Billings' books do bring the general reader to realize just how emotional the fighting men
                    of 1861-1865 were during the last of the chivalrous wars.</p>

            <p>In 1869, W. H. H. Terrell, adjutant general for the state of Indiana during the latter part of the
                    Civil War, issued the <hi rend="i">Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Indiana.</hi> The
                    work included eight volumes and covered the entire period of the Civil War. The first of the eight
                    volumes was the most significant one as an historical source. It was composed of 466 pages of text
                    supplemented by 372 pages of statistics and documents describing Indiana's participation in
                    the great war. The remaining seven volumes were largely composed of rosters of Indiana officers and
                    soldiers.</p>
            <p>The volume under review is a reprint of the major portions of Terrell's Volume I. It
                    corrects certain typographical errors and changes punctuation in a manner consistent with better
                    usage. It has also been organized into chapters. Minor text material and most of the statistical and
                    documentary supplements have been omitted. These omissions have been noted in the new edition, and
                    reference is made by means of footnotes citing the original Volume I. The remaining statistical and
                    documentary supplements which are reprinted include the summary of troops furnished by the state of
                    Indiana, the chronological list of engagements in which Indiana troops participated, and the
                    campaigns in which Indiana troops participated. An index for the volume has also been supplied. In
                    addition, there is a thoughtful Foreword by the eminent Bell I. Wiley, of Emory University, chairman
                    of the Committee on Historical Activities of the National Civil War Centennial Commission, and an
                    anonymous editorial note with biographical data concerning Terrell.</p>
            <p>In considering the value of this reprint, it should first be said that any study of
                    Indiana's participation in the Civil War begins with the Adjutant General's
                    report. Because it is in many respects a direct transcript of original documents, it is a primary
                    source for a wide <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-057-4-105"/> range of <hi rend="i">facts.</hi> For these
                    facts, there is no usable substitute for this volume. These facts include such things as the number
                    of Indiana regiments raised and their terms of service; the operations of the draft in Indiana;
                    facts about the Indiana Legion, the "home guard" of the period; military
                    financing; relief of soldiers and their families, including the activities of the Indiana Sanitary
                    Commission; and the manufacture of ammunition in Indiana. The reprint also contains a caveat
                    pointing up the limitations of the work when it departs from factual data and pursues
                    interpretations of Indiana politics of the Civil War period.</p>
            <p>The caveat attached to the reprint is in the form of Wiley's Foreword. Although he was not
                    asked and did not set forth details, he does refer to the widely accepted traditional view of
                    Indiana politics during the period of the Civil War and immediately thereafter. According to this
                    tradition, Oliver P. Morton and his faction of the Republican party appear as the exclusive
                    champions of the Union in Indiana. The Democrats are cast as southern sympathizers, men actively
                    seeking to destroy the Union. Also featured are the Knights of the Golden Circle and the Sons of
                    Liberty, secret organizations with loyalties to the Confederacy. According to the tradition, the
                    line between these latter organizations and the Democratic party is very indistinctly drawn.</p>
            <p>As is true of so many historical traditions, that concerning Indiana Civil War politics is elusive.
                    Within each of the traditional characterizations of the warring political elements there lies
                    sufficient truth and apparent truth to make rebuttal difficult. Only in relatively recent years have
                    studies appeared raising any questions about the tradition. In 1949 Kenneth M. Stampp issued <hi rend="i">Indiana Politics during the Civil War</hi> (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Ind.), an able book which mutes the high colors of the tradition. Frank L. Klement has
                    recently carried the revision further with an exposition which is also well done <hi rend="i">(The
                        Copperheads in the Middle West</hi> [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Ill., I960]). In addition to questioning the stereotypes of the tradition, these
                    studies show that Governor Morton and his colleagues actively and consciously assisted in the
                    creation of the tradition by accusations of disloyalty against their opponents and by elaborate
                    charades designed to create the impression of imminent peril to the state. W. H. H. Terrell was a
                    Morton man. Not surprisingly, his report accepted the premises of the Morton administration and
                    therefore assisted in carrying along the myth. This is the point which Wiley makes in his Foreword,
                    so that the reprint, unlike the original, may be evaluated with a view to its limitations.</p>
            <p>A republication and wider dissemination of the <hi rend="i">facts</hi> contained in this volume make
                    this reprint worthwhile. This value is increased because of the better organization and indexing of
                    the reprint as compared to the original work. And because of the caveat, the benefits of the reprint
                    are not mitigated by the inclusion of the traditional partisan view of internal politics. The
                    Indiana Historical Society and its editors have therefore done extremely well in bringing forth this
                    book.</p>

                    </placeName>, Ark.: Pioneer Press, Civil War Publications, Inc., 1960. No pagination. Numerous
                    illustrations. De luxe edition, $25.00; regular edition, $18.00.)</head>
            <p>This impressive publication is introduced by letters from General U. S. Grant, III, and Robert E.
                    Lee, IV, together with the pictures of their illustrious military forbearers. It is composed of
                    reprints of thirty-six battle scenes published by Kurtz and Allison, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, during the decade 1884–1894. The battle scenes are arranged
                    chronologically, and each carries the date of original publication. The originals have been hunted
                    out from a variety of archives and libraries, and each repository is given due credit.</p>
            <p>Besides the reprints, the publication gives a narrative of the battle pictured. The authors include
                    trained historians, military men with a flair for the Civil War, and a variety of others who are
                    just plain enthusiasts. The narratives on the whole are well done and above the mere traditional
                    level. The choice of authors has been fortunate considering the fact that the publication is part of
                    the centennial offering, and the Civil War buff must be its chief supporter.</p>
            <p>The publisher does not vouch for accuracy of the battle series but does point out that Lincoln sent
                    Kurtz to battlefields to make sketches. These sketches are presumably reflected in the prints issued
                    by the firm Kurtz headed though they came out several years after the war. Some do show familiarity
                    with the battle terrain, but for the most part they stress traditional high points of the battle. In
                    this area—the traditional battle—the historian of the period will find his
                    chief interest. Published nearly a generation after the war, the prints reflect interpretations
                    already stereotyped and point up things related to the war that still lived. Here and there one
                    detects the "cavalier," and the "rebel charge" is frequent.
                    There is a little touch of the abolitionist detectable. The action of Negro troops is stressed, and
                    in the Fort Pillow affair all the basics of <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> are
                    depicted. The proportionate stress on western battles shows the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> origin of the prints.</p>
            <p>The publisher has spared no effort in reproducing these postwar mementos of the great conflict. The
                    book is an excellent job from every angle, and for the Civil War buff who specializes in the area,
                    it is a must.</p>

            <p>At its 1895 term the Supreme Court handed down three significant decisions. In the <hi rend="i">Knight</hi> sugar trust case it narrowly interpreted the word "commerce" so
                    as to exclude manufacturing within the meaning of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In the <hi rend="i">Debs</hi> case it upheld a lower court's injunction against the leaders of the
                    American Railway Union, recently involved in the Pullman strike. And in the <hi rend="i">Pollock</hi> case it <pb n="381" id="VAA4025-057-4-107"/> invalidated the controversial federal
                    income tax of 1894. To advocates of social reform, this term of the Court seemed to mark an
                    unfortunate victory for laissez-faire conservatism. Judicial supremacy in government, they
                    complained, was obstructing indispensable public policies.</p>
            <p>In this volume, Professor Paul traces the "revolutionary" course of legal thought
                    during the preceding decade from a traditional conservatism to novel, "right-wing"
                    positions of the mid-1890's. From research in law journals, bar association publications,
                    and judicial reports he gathered his materials for an interesting study in intellectual as well as
                    constitutional history. Year by year the attitudes of bar and bench reflected the rising social
                    tensions of an industrial nation. Increasingly, conservatives were disturbed by the assaults or
                    menaces against corporate wealth and power. Their search for protection of property rights pointed
                    naturally to the judiciary as the most reliable defender against majoritarian oppression. One of the
                    many evidences of this shifting legal philosophy was the shrinking state police power as judges read
                    a new doctrine of substantive due process of law into the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus railroad rates
                    must be <hi rend="i">reasonably</hi> regulated—in the judgment of the courts, not the
                    legislatures.</p>
            <p>One has the impression that the tone of the book is too partisan. Steadfastly, the author sympathizes
                    with the reformers and censures the "new" conservatives. Consequently, he is
                    probably led into some errors and misunderstandings. His discussion of substantive due process of
                    law is an example. Although that doctrine was new during the 1890's in the context of the
                    Fourteenth Amendment, its antecedents can be found well back in English and American history.
                    Lawyers' arguments in the <hi rend="i">Dartmouth College</hi> case (1819), <hi rend="i">Ogden v. Saunders</hi> (1827), and <hi rend="i">Groves v. Slaughter</hi> (1841) are a few, and
                    not the first, statements of the idea. If John Marshall had had his way (and he almost did) in <hi rend="i">Ogden</hi> v. <hi rend="i">Saunders,</hi> he would have transformed the contract clause
                    into a due process clause. Actually, the line between what Professor Paul approves as
                    "procedural" due process and what he disapproves as
                    "substantive" is a very shadowy one. Indeed the rationale of substantive due
                    process <hi rend="i">was</hi> procedural. Fair trial in court, with all the traditional guarantees
                    for individual rights that this connotes, was due process, while legislative enactments confiscating
                    property or just profits were not. The trouble may not have been so much with the judges'
                    legal rules as with the judges themselves. The judicial process always necessitates a choice of
                    alternatives and a balancing of substantial competing interests. During this period of history the
                    bench and bar were not yet educated to economic realities or to the needs and aspirations of a large
                    number of the American people. This is what Brandeis saw when, as an attorney before the Supreme
                    Court, he set out to educate their honors by his celebrated factual briefs. By the way, those who
                    later deplored substantive due process of law in the economic area (Holmes among them) were usually
                    quite willing to apply the doctrine rigorously in behalf of civil liberties.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding such points of interpretation, where there is much room for divergent opinion, the
                    book is, on the whole, a good one. Professor Paul cuts a new swath in the yet uncleared field of
                    legal <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-057-4-108"/> thought for a period of special interest. Further work of
                    this kind is needed before a broader and improved synthesis of constitutional history can be
                    achieved. The author well deserved the Beveridge Award of the American Historical Association.</p>

            <p>Historians often are inclined to believe that there has been a steady decline in the quality of the
                    American newspaper since the end of the nineteenth century when Joseph Pulitzer and William <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hearst created sensationalism. Newspapermen generally disagree with this
                    interpretation, pointing to the fact that twentieth-century newspapers, for all their entertainment
                    features, contain far more of solid news information—reported considerably more exactly
                    and expeditiously—than those of the previous century. Assigned to write a compact volume
                    on newspapers as a part of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s series on the history of American civilization, Bernard A. Weisberger
                    balances the two points of view fairly well. The reader may find consideration of the point of view
                    of intellectuals who regret the coming of newspaper "empires" and consideration of
                    that of professionals who appreciate the increased objectivity of the press.</p>
            <p>"There is no need for despair," Weisberger writes. "It would be foolhardy
                    to insist flatly that the makers and molders of journalism will never break through the limitations
                    of the mass-communications newspaper to answer the challenge of the age. A new American newspaperman
                    may yet emerge, wielding some unforeseen cost-cutting mechanism, reaching for some as yet
                    unsuspected audience, shouting, shaping, innovating, and carrying on the traditions of a calling
                    which, all in all, has had many things to boast of" (p. 203).</p>
            <p>Weisberger came to the field of journalism through a study written a decade ago, which was rather
                    undistinguished, of reporters on the Union side in the Civil War. His new book has more sweep. He is
                    by profession a cultural historian and appropriately treats the press as an aspect of the
                    nation's cultural history. He also follows the pattern of several journalism historians in
                    emphasizing economic currents in the stream of the American press, the fiscal and mechanical
                    developments.</p>
            <p>For the scholar in the field of journalism, the new book will be less satisfactory than either Frank
                    L. Mott's volume or that of Edwin Emery and Henry L. Smith. Although both of those are
                    written as textbooks, they are more substantial than the present book. Weisberger's book
                    may be more useful to the conventional historian and to the lay reader. At least one insight in the
                    new synthesis may be useful even to students of journalism history. This is the interpretation of
                    the first half of the nineteenth century as a period of "special audience" papers.
                    Traditionally, that era has been called the period of the "party press."
                    Weisberger's interpretation seems a more inclusive one.</p>
            <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-057-4-109"/>
            <p>One fault of the book is a fault of scholarship in the field generally. This is an overemphasis upon
                    the development of the press in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. An outstanding characteristic of the American press is its
                    provincialism—the fact that this country, unlike Britain, <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, Russia, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ag">Argentina</country>
                    </placeName>, for example, has never developed a national journalism. As Weisberger shows, there
                    were the beginnings of such a national press first in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, but provincialism won out. The newspapers of the provincial cities like <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName> have represented more truly the pattern of American journalism than those of <placeName>

                    cities and almost none at all in lesser cities. Weisberger, like others before him, has had to
                    depend upon the literature available.</p>

            <p>In the past decade there has developed among historians and political scientists an interest in
                    administrative history. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> Ilchman offers a significant contribution to this expanding field in his study of the
                    growth of a professional diplomatic corps within the Department of State. In this initial study the
                    author concentrates on the gradual transformation of American representatives on the secretarial
                    level from temporary political appointees to career officers selected on the basis of competitive
                    examinations. A future volume will examine developments on the ministerial level, compare American
                    and British experience, and judge what influence the movement toward professional diplomacy has had
                    on the conduct of American foreign policy.</p>
            <p>Ilchman's research was wide, varied, and solid. Perhaps the only materials not investigated
                    which could have added much to a study of this type were the individual, confidential records of the
                    secretaries which the Department of State has not, and in all probability will not, open to
                    historians. Much of the research is condensed into statistics demonstrating the increasing tenure of
                    the secretaries after the profession was placed on a career basis, the growing number and quality of
                    applicants taking the examinations, and the high percentage of graduates of eastern colleges
                    appointed to the foreign service.</p>
            <p>The statistical approach, however, does not make for easy reading; the figures are valuable, but many
                    of them belong in footnotes and not in the text. The book is for the specialist who will use it as a
                    valuable reference work. The general reader, however, will find little that holds his interest in a
                    mass of figures and chapters that increase in length from forty to sixty-seven pages; long chapters
                    written in the weak passive voice simply do not hold a reader's attention. A more serious
                    defect is that the author is not always clear in his explanations; a good example of this failure is
                    with regard to the awarding of bonus points <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-057-4-110"/> on the competitive
                    examinations to applicants who did not receive the requisite score. This gift made it possible for
                    some of the failures to receive appointments to the foreign service. By whose authority this policy
                    was carried out and why is never explained. It would seem to be a rather serious defect in a system
                    designed to produce quality candidates and certainly deserves explanation. In addition, the author
                    on numerous occasions refers to various men by their last names only and never fully identifies
                    them. An incomplete index adds to the confusion. The old maxim that one should spend as much time on
                    writing as on research was apparently violated by a promising young scholar.</p>

            <p>No reviewer will approach such a book as this with confidence. The volume lies heavily on his desk,
                    familiar in its <hi rend="i">AHR</hi>-blue jacket, but forbidding inside with its double columns of
                    dense print. All these monographs and narratives and biographies and collections of printed sources
                    and atlases! How does one discover whether anything significant has been left out (beyond the small
                    point where the book moves across the reviewer's cultivated patch) or something unworthy
                    included? But even when omissions are found, or an occasional lack of balance noted, there is no
                    ground for criticism in view of the vast amount of material which has been assembled between the
                    covers. Better to examine the principles governing selection and arrangement and test the book by
                    its success in meeting the challenge of its own purpose.</p>
            <p>As stated by the editors, this new bibliography is to be not merely an aid to students and fledgling
                    specialists but a demonstration of the vital part played by the historical craft in our
                    interpretation of mankind's collective experience. One turns with greatest interest,
                    therefore, to the initial section on "History and Related Studies," where the
                    whole scale of problems concerning scope and method and meaning of history is taken up. The very
                    first impression is disappointing. An unfortunately self-conscious essay pleads the
                    historian's case to be taken seriously as viewer of the world, and does it in a ponderous
                    style which will not persuade many readers that history can be an attractive subject. But the
                    listings that follow are excellently chosen and, in many cases, aptly characterized. The only major
                    omission occurs among the list of journals devoted to general historical problems: <hi rend="i">History and Theory,</hi> the first number of which appeared in 1960. It would be nice to think
                    that our colleagues will encourage their students to make their way through a sampling of these
                    books on the nature and theory of history, but that is perhaps an unrealistic hope.</p>
            <p>The brief introductory essays to the sections that follow are appropriate and serve to hold otherwise
                    centrifugal material to the vital center of historical concerns. There is a useful account of
                    "General <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-057-4-111"/> Reference Resources," a generous
                    list of universal histories and of histories of religion. The arrangement of the sections on
                    "Historical Beginnings" and on Middle Periods shows the influence of Toynbee, but
                    the items listed include the most recent works on archaeology and anthropology. In accordance with
                    one of the stated purposes of the book, the student finds his native parochialism attacked by
                    frequent confrontations with the nonwestern world. This restoration of <hi rend="i">Welt-geschichte</hi> to its proper proportions is justification enough for the new bibliography.
                    But it gives us much more besides. There is a strong argument in favor of mastering the scholarly
                    languages; the mere itemizing of the best choices in historical reading shows why linguistic
                    training must precede, not follow, serious occupation with history. For every major topic there is
                    an excellent selection of the most important collections of printed sources and sometimes a
                    paragraph on libraries and museums. The brief comments on individual books vary considerably in
                    quality; some (as in the section on Greek historiography) are apt and informative, others jejune. A
                    number of English translations have not been caught up with, Marrou's <hi rend="i">History
                        of Education in Antiquity,</hi> for instance. But so much is presented that one cannot really
                    notice gaps. The history of science is represented, and so are the military arts. The modern period,
                    especially, is bewildering in its richness, with sections on the Americas, Africa, Australasia and
                    Oceania following upon Europe and its adjacent areas.</p>
            <p>The final section is a lengthy survey, miscellaneous in character, of "The World in Recent
                    Times." There is a good index of names and topics. Perhaps the best thing that can be said
                    about this book is that, in addition to its practical usefulness, it makes good reading for anyone
                    who wants at least to sample with his eyes the sumptuous feast of mankind's historical
                    tradition. It is to be hoped that those who use the book do so not only to consult, but also to
                    browse.</p>

                    $6.50.)</head>
            <p>Despite the subtitle, this is not a social history of the Poles in America. Instead it is largely a
                    laudatory account of the part played by individual Poles and those of Polish descent in American
                    life. That the study is not entirely historical is indicated by the emphasis placed on contemporary
                    personalities. If the author's objective was to satisfy the pride of Polish-Americans, he
                    did his job well. The depth of his scholarship is also indicated by the fact that he covers the
                    period from 1608 to 1960 in only 294 pages.</p>
            <p>Dr. Wytrwal inserts much superfluous material in this study. Pages are devoted to phases of Polish
                    history, particularly in the years before 1870, which have no connection with Polish emigration to
                    America. Gilda Gray and her "shimmy" dance are given almost a page. Also, is it
                    necessary to present a long list of baseball, football, and golf stars, many of whom are active
                    today, merely because they are of Polish <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-057-4-112"/> descent? The author
                    was apparently concerned with the sale of his book. Otherwise, the listing of the names of at least
                    150 delegates of Polish descent to the Democratic national conventions of 1956 and 1960 and to the
                    Republican convention of 1960 in the same footnote is hardly justified.</p>
            <p>The most scholarly portions of this volume are those chapters devoted to the numerous fraternal
                    organizations for Polish-Americans. The objectives of these orders were to satisfy the longing of
                    the bewildered immigrant for security in a strange land, to protect his economic interests, to
                    preserve a degree of Polish culture as well as to retain contact with the mother country, and
                    finally to fit the immigrant into the American pattern of life. The largest and most important of
                    these organizations were the Polish American Catholic Union (PRCU) and the Polish National Alliance
                    (PNA). The former was dominated largely by the clergy while the latter was more under secular
                    control.</p>
            <p>This study is based almost entirely on secondary material such as Polish-American publications and
                    the works of writers of Polish descent. There is an excellent bibliography, and the index is
                    adequate.</p>

            <p>Many remember well the drab, lifeless state histories produced as recently as the 1930's. In
                    appearance they were as unexciting to the reader's eye as their texts were to his mind.
                    Fortunately mid-century examples of the genre are things of beauty to both eye and mind; to this
                    list, including John W. Caughey's <hi rend="i">

                    </hi> (1955), must be added Dean Schell's centennial volume, <hi rend="i">South
                    Dakota.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this tightly packed volume are included most of the facts pertinent to the story of the state.
                    Even more important are inferences and judgements based on the record. A few of them are: that the
                    vested interests of the towns objected to attempts to keep land transactions honest; that
                    speculators received the most advantage from the homestead law; that lax administration of land laws
                    "retarded social progress" by speeding the development of farm tenancy. And,
                    writing in a time more bedeviled and generally troubled than Americans of World War I could have
                    imagined, Dean Schell is forthrightly critical of the Council of Defense and of overzealous patriots
                    in the years 1917–1919. In a fine chapter on pioneer life he advances the view of Gilbert
                    C. Fite (a native of Wessington Springs, S.D.) that frontier life while hard was not so drab and
                    dull as usually pictured. The work is uniformly good, but the chapters on the range cattle industry,
                    immigration, and the fortunes of the Indians are especially interesting and filled with graphic
                    detail and insight.</p>
            <p>This reader misses a map showing not only towns but also identifying rivers and railroads mentioned
                    in the text. He regrets the comparative <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-057-4-113"/> neglect of the role of
                    churches, the absence of an effort to explain the the one-party character of the state, and the
                    little space that has been given to the problem of maintaining a modern American community in a
                    region that is, at best, subhumid. The author notes in Chapter 20 that in the present era of
                    unprecedented prosperity the cost of government is almost more than the handful of South Dakotans
                    can meet—even with generous help from the industrial East. A resident of the other
                    Dakota, where the water problem is a critical one, regrets Dean Schell's failure to
                    consider their region's long-term prospects.</p>

                    Indiana University, announces that approximately forty-five to fifty Lilly Fellowships in American
                    History will be awarded during the spring of 1962. These fellowships, valued at $1,000
                    each, will be awarded to prospective and present teachers of American history in the junior and
                    senior high schools of the state. Recipients of Lilly Fellowships will study American history and
                    related subjects during three successive summer sessions and pursue independent study on a part-time

            <head>Correction—"Caleb Townes"</head>
            <p>In its June issue of this year the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> published an
                    interesting and informative letter under the title of "From <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Old Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1815," a letter said to have been written by Caleb Townes. From two alert
                    readers we have learned the "Caleb Townes" was actually Caleb Lownes. The editors
                    of this letter and the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> jointly express their
                    appreciation for the correction. Both of them had proofread the letter against the original and
                    misread the <hi rend="i">L</hi> as a <hi rend="i">T.</hi> Both wish that Caleb Lownes had formed his
                    capital letters more carefully!</p>
