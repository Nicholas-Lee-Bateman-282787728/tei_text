            <p>During the financially-disturbed years following the American Revolution, thousands of settlers left
                    the populated counties of the eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and migrated westward. Many of these immigrants poured through Pennsylvania to Kentucky
                    and later to the Northwest Territory, but a substantial number settled in the central and western
                    sections of the Keystone State. Some of the new Pennsylvanians purchased farms vacated during the
                    Revolution, when Indian raids had frightened earlier inhabitants back to the safer eastern
                    communities; others chose virgin acreage. Whatever the choice, land in Pennsylvania was expensive;
                    but the newly-created commonwealth had abolished quitrents, outlawed slavery, and removed Indian
                    claims from its limits. As a result population in the central and western sections of the state
                    increased approximately 85 percent in the two decades following the Revolution.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    lands in the Ohio Valley.</p>
            <p>During the six years included in this migration the number of settlers pouring west was likened to a

                    originated in Pennsylvania and the Upland South. A smaller number of settlers came from as far north

                    plantation system and slavery in the South; others were collecting land bonuses given soldiers after
                    the War of 1812. The war had advertised the West; the Indians had been defeated; thus many
                    immigrants took advantage of the period of readjustment, prosperity, and expansion to seek new
                    homes. Whatever their reasons for migrating the settlers' destination was usually the Ohio

                    prices on agricultural produce and other commodities had fallen precipitously. The crash came early
                    in 1819 and was the more disastrous because it was the new nation's first major financial

                    sold nearly all his personal property and then his farm and took continental currency and in six
                    months after, his fine farm that sold at a high price would not have paid for a good horse. He was
                    left with a wife and seven children, six sons and one daughter almost destitute but he being a man
                    of health and vigor moved to the center of Pensylvania [<placeName>

                    to an old bachelor by the name of William Mackey. Grandfather took a lease of ten years and moved on
                    it in the year 1786. My father was only ten years old at this time. At the exporation <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> of the lease he had a fine farm, it being first and second bottom on the Sesquehanna
                    River in the county that is called Lycumming [Lycoming] near the town of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>This brings it to 1796. My father at that date was twenty years old. Grandfather then took a new
                    lease of ten years in which he was to put up a good house and barn which was done in good order.
                    This brings it to 1806. At this date grandfather, father and another brother bought a tract of land
                    in an a joining valley White Deer was the indian name of the valley. It took its name from a creek
                    running through the valley. This tract was divided into three farms of over one hundred acres each.
                    Here grandfather died some time between 1816 and 1820. I recollect of seeing him in 1816. That was
                    the year that father moved from that part. Grandfather at that time was very old. He was upwards of
                    eighty. I now leave grandfather and return to father.</p>

                    </placeName>. Ohio was the great western country of that time 1812. But being dissapointed in his
                    money he concluded to stay one year longer in the old country The owner of the old farm that
                    grandfather cleared after the Revolution came some miles to see if father would take it for a number
                    of years. This was in the year 1812. Father had prepared himself with a strong Pensylvania wagon and
                    four large horses. He was well prepared for farming. The farm was over two hundred acers of first
                    and second rate land. He did well on the farm and staid four years but he never got over the western
                    fever.</p>
            <p>The first recollection that I have of Pensylvania was on that place. I can look back and see it yet.
                    The house stood on an elevation about one hundred rods wide and forty or fifty feet above the first
                    bottom with a view up and down the river of three or four miles. The river ran at the foot of a
                    mountain six or seven hundred feet high. The mountain was called Muncey [Muncy] Hill. There was a
                    half mile of level second bottom in reach of the house. It appears to me yet after a period of
                    seventy two years that it was a very beautiful place.</p>
            <p>I now return to my father. The western fever was still high Father collected his money and made all
                    preperations to start west in the spring of 1816 but there was another very serious dissappointment.
                    After all was ready with four fine horses and a large wagon, one man that had borrowed three hundred
                    [dollars] failed, but he would pay in two weeks sure. The farmer had to have the house and moved in.
                    We lived together two weeks but the money was still unpaid at the end of that time Father got a
                    house in a village (Summerset or Pits town) a few miles off and unloaded a few things to make out
                    for a short time. One dissappointment after another kept us till the first of August when father
                    left his note with his brother William for collection. It was collected after it had accumulated
                    thirty dollars interest. This turned out to be fortunate rather than a misfortune as it will be seen
                    hereafter.</p>
            <p>When we were already for the move we had to wait over another Sunday to go to hear Mr Hood preach. He
                    was the old presbyterian preacher that came once a month to a lonely log meeting house that had been
                    built in the woods almost <pb n="12" id="VAA4025-061-1-016"/> three quarters of a mile from the
                    village where we were stying. That neighborhood had worshiped Mr Hood in place of their God for ten
                    years and father and mother still worshiped him for some time after reaching <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. On that day Mr Hood gave father a written passport to Heaven (a certificate of
                    membership) also for the four first born children that he had washed from sin, of which I was one. I
                    still hold the paper which is seventy two years old. I expect to hold it as long as I stay as the
                    other three are gone long since to Heaven if there is any such place which I have no doubt but that
                    there is but as for a hell only the grave. I here solmenly affirm that I have no belief.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> It is a belief that I have no control over. I believe that God is love as my
                    testament teaches me and love can not cast off forever. Where is the father on earth that could or
                    would torment forever and God who is more tender with his children than any earthly parent is with
                    his. For me to say that I beleaved in such doctrine would be blaspheming the name of the Lord. I
                    know that universalism is a very unpopular belief but it is none the less true. Christ himself that
                    taught it, was very unpopular among the pharisees of that day, and how can I expect not to be
                    equally unpopular among the pharisees of this day. Although there are many even in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> that beleive the doctrine that will not acknowledge it for many reasons.</p>
            <p>After attending meeting one more night Monday came. There was all bustle. The neighbors and relatives
                    came from every direction. It seems but a short time to look back and see two grandfather's
                    both near eighty years old and one grandmother about the same age. When I look back to that time
                    when I was only six years old on August eight seventy two years seems short. When our start was made
                    in driving in a very bad place we broke the forward axeltree of the wagon on the evening of the same
                    day that we started. It happened in a good place close to the house of a familiar acquaintance that
                    took the family in and appeared as if they could not do enough for us. On the next day about twelve
                    all was ready for a new start. This happened close to a mill where there was a store, smith-shop,
                    and wagon-shop Nothing more occured of note till we drove into Reading.</p>

                    River. We were joined on the rode by an old acquaintance from the same part from which we started.
                    The horses were taken across to Cincinnatti [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>] by two yound men. My Uncle James Tate and a Mr Sedam. We were told in sveral places to
                    take all the peaches we wanted. On the Ohio in many places the banks were covered with peaches
                    orchards full of ripe fruit. The owners of the orchards refused to take a cent for the peaches that
                    we took. They were in several places distiling into brandy on a small scale and the fruit was still
                    rotting in the orchards One man told father that he had more than five thousand bushels and two
                    stills at work and still the peaches were rotting in the orchard</p>
            <p>We arrived at Cincinnatti some time in September. It was at that time the largest town that I had
                    ever seen. It contained sixteen hundred inhabitanc, and I thought the best brick building That I had
                    ever seen.</p>
            <p>We arrived at Cincinnatti with our large Pensylvania wagon, four good dutch horses, family well clad
                    and one thousand one hundred in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> paper money. The young man with horses beat us to Cincinnatti about three or four days.
                    In paying for goods in Cincinnatti father took out a roll of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> money "Why mister mister! your money is getting too far from home. The banks
                    might break months before you would know any thing about it. You had better be getting it off for
                    money nearer home." "Why! is it not good" asked my father? "We
                    can use it in payment for <pb n="14" id="VAA4025-061-1-018"/> goods in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> but our own money is very much prefered for all common use through the
                    country" said the merchant. I can use your money to pay for goods and give you other money
                    for it if it would be any accommodation to you. Father thought that all was right as the merchant
                    appeared to be very much of a gentleman and very accommodating so they swoped money. It was all
                    right at the time</p>
            <p>Father went out sixteen miles from Cincinnatti Every thing was high rite after the war of 1812. Land
                    around Cincinnatti sold for forty dollars an acer where father expected to get it for eight or ten
                    dollars an acer. Father bought three milk cows at high prices. He bought gogs [hogs] and corn and
                    rented a farm and concluded to wait the sale of land farther west. In the fall of 1816 father rented
                    a farn. Put in twenty acres of wheat and had a good crop.</p>
            <p>Banks began to be doubtful. Finally in 1817 banks went all at once and land fell over half.
                    Father's Ohio money went to almost nothing. In the fall of 1818 father paid twenty dollars
                    in paper money for one single barrel of salt. He had more horses than he wanted to keep. He sold a
                    very valuable horse. The man failed and never paid one dollar. Father had always worked rich bottom
                    land. He rented the second farm on the big Miama [Big Miami] and raised good crops, but the fever
                    and ague was very bad four out of five falls. The loss of time and doctor's bills took all
                    that we could make. Grain was very low. I knew father to hall wheat to Cincinnatti and sell it at
                    forty and forty five cents a bushel. Well now came the good fortune that two years before in
                    Pensylvania we thought to be bad at the time. Uncle William collected the money that was left in
                    Pensylvania and sent it out to father. $330 was in silver. As needy as we were that laid
                    in the bottom of an old chest from 1818 till 1822. At this date father, uncle Jacob, Colonel Gargas
                    [Garrigus], and a Mr Catterland [Catterlin] came on horse back and carried their silver in saddle
                    bags. Colonel Jeptha Garigas was the same man that figured largely in this county from 1830 to 1840.
                    Mr Catterland bought land and settled in the neighborhood of <placeName>

                    that had laid out many nights in the mountains of Pensylvania. He thought nothing of lying out,
                    which they had to do many times. They looked at land in the neighborhood of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and were well pleased with it, but they thought that it was too far from navigation.
                    The land office was then at Terrehaute. They took numbers and went to Terrehaute to the land sale.
                    At Terrehaute they fell in with a Mr Gilke and a Mr Pottenger from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>

                    </placeName> near the place where father lived. They told father that they could show them land
                    within four miles of the river, that they would undoubtly like. These two young men volintered their
                    services and came up the river thirty miles. They crossed Raccoon [Creek] at the army ford that is
                    mow Armyberg [Armies-burg] and went up through the unsurveyed indian reserve prairie. Father and
                    uncle both expressed themselves in the same language that nothing could be hansomer but there were
                    no settlers. The same winter and the next spring there came a fare swarm. So much so that the next
                    fall 1823 we bought all the corn that we wanted and it was not one fourth of the amount that they
                    had to sell. We bought corn at twenty cents a bushel and pork for two dollars a hundred. On the land
                    that 0. P. Brown's father bought in 1824 at the reserve land sale There were sixteen cabins
                    and seventeen families. This is no heresay with me for in the fall of 1823 shortly after our arrival
                    in the woods brother John and I were sent for corn. We found plenty of corn at Yanketown [Yankeetown
                    ?] a little village of cabins all in a huddle with little regard to streets or pavements. They were
                    all using the water from a trough that was fed by other troughs that conducted the water from that
                    everlasting spring in the hill fifty feet above O. P. Browns house, which in later days was put in
                    lead pipes. This everlasting spring still ran on fifty years longer and then dried up like the
                    everlasting inheritance of Canaan that has long since passed away. The inhabitance of that town all
                    joined together and fenced a field of one hundred and fifty or one hundred and seventy acres. Each
                    one put in so many rods of fence. Each one made rales of his own choice of length I helped to reset
                    some fence of that field in 1836 and I found rales from eight up to sixteen feet long. Each length
                    of rales were to themselves. Corn was twenty cents and not <pb n="16" id="VAA4025-061-1-020"/>

                    $1.50 to $2.00 a hundred. Mast was very plenty and hogs were mostly fattened
                    on it. Potatoes were scarce at 25 cts a bushel. Wheat, which there was none on the following fall,
                    came down to 10 cents and was hard to sell at that.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1822 father and uncle Jacob Ten Brook returned to Ohio after securing each one hundred
                    and sixty acers of land in range eight, Township sixteen Section ten The south half of said section
                    is two miles west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Annapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the same distance from Bloomingdale. The south east quarter I own at the present
                    time. It has never passed out of the family and has been in the family sixty six years. Provisions
                    had to be made for a final move. We were very much poorer than we were when we landed at Cincinnatti
                    seven years before. The failure of the banks in 1817 and 1818 swept from father nearly all that he
                    was worth. Nearly every thing that he had being in Ohio money. It was saved to lay out for land and
                    all swept off in a very short time. Sickness and doctor's bills and very low prices for
                    corn and wheat made it impossible to make more than a poor living.</p>
            <p>Father had twenty acres or more of good wheat and he put in seventeen acers of corn on Miami bottom.
                    It was very good and was estimated at sixty five or seventy bushels to the acre. The wheat when
                    harvested and tramped out with horses and then hailed to Cincinnatti brought at first forty five and
                    then fell to forty cents a bushel. Father's two thirds of the crop was two hundred bushels
                    or nearly so. He tried for some time to sell the corn in the field but he could not get any offer in
                    money. After some time a man offered him one good cow, and to send a team of two yoke of oxen and a
                    strong wagon to hawl a load. A man that wanted to see the country offered to drive the team for
                    twenty five cents a day. Nineteen hogs waying over one hundred each sold for twenty dollars. About
                    the twenty fifth of August all was ready for a start. We started about ten o'clock. The
                    second day we got near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> where we fell in with uncle Jacob's family at a widow Ten Brooks where our
                    arrangements were to meet. The second day from that time we were overtaken by two teams with three
                    stout men. The family of John Jessup. We were all together at the last house on the rode close to
                    Flatrock [Flat Rock] creek. Number in each</p>

            <p>Our stock was. Father had three horses. Two were the same that were brought from Pensyliania seven
                    years before. Uncle Jacob had two. Jessup's had two and each of the three teamsters had
                    two. There were in all thirteen. Our cattle. Father had six milk cows, two three year old heifers
                    and one two year old steer. There were nine in all. Uncle Jacob had nine head of cattle five of
                    which were milk cows. Jessups had three milk cows. In all there were twenty one. Horses and cattle
                    in all 34. Here we were camped out for the first time all together close to a Mr Reeds. The last
                    house before taking the big woods west of Flat creek Men, wimen and children 27. Horses and cattle
                    34. There were still two yoke of large oxen and four dogs lived to enter the woods.</p>
            <p>I will here relate that Mr Reed told us to be careful that we did not get turned around and come back
                    there that evening. He said that about one month before a single team drove in in the morning. It
                    was a very cloudy day and late in the evening he drove out of the woods inquiring for the same place
                    that he had inquired for in the morning. He could hardly be convinced that he had been there before.</p>
            <p>The road was in places fully one half mile wide. The rode turned around old logs and trees in every
                    direction, and the progress was slow. In one place after examining. The forward team drove in. In a
                    very short time the wagon not fairly in the forward sank. The horses plunged in around their sides
                    in water and stiff mud. Finally one fell and the other fell on him. Then all hands as soon as they
                    could get to them unhitched all the four horses and got the two out. Forward horses on not sollid
                    but muddy ground. They examined both ways but could not tell which was up or down. <pb n="19" id="VAA4025-061-1-023"/> Well! What was to be done. Father told them that they had to take one
                    out of two ways. Stay there across the slew or turnabout. They went back a few rods where there was
                    plenty of long limbed beech. The ox team having come up the brush was hauled and laid under the
                    tongue and across the slew. In the center it was two feet thick and weighted on the sides with heavy
                    poles. In three or four hours the ox team was put to the forward wagon and went right through and
                    swore that it was the best road that he had had that day.</p>
            <p>The next thing was to find a good camping place. Uncle Jacob went ahead and found a very nice camping
                    ground on a high place. He got to tramping down the weeds which were waist high. All at once a
                    rattle snake forbid his intrusion. The wagons came up one after another. When the wimen heard of the
                    snake they could not stay nearer than one mile of that place. Uncle Jacob put out ahead and could
                    not find a place to suit in less than two miles. He found a place where there was a nice little
                    stream with plenty of fish in it. It was a nice camping place with grass and peavines waist high. It
                    was late and fully dark when the ox team came up. He said that he would have turned out the oxen and
                    went in the wagon to bed had it not been for our yelling and halooing and blowing three tin horns,
                    and fireing off guns. After he got within one half mile he gave his team a good rest and drove very
                    slowly for a while not giving any alarm of his mearness till he drove into camp. He was not very
                    well pleased. The next morning he told the company that he forgave that time but that they had
                    better not leave him in good roads or he would let them help themselves in the next swamp.</p>
            <p>Our cattle with all the feed that they could eat and slow driving gave more milk than we all could
                    make use of. There were in all fourteen milk cows.</p>
            <p>The date of days I can not recollect. In the date of the year I am correct 1823. I know that we
                    started between the twenty fift of August and the first of September. After a long and fatiguing
                    journey we got through about the first frost and the last of papaw time.</p>
            <p>Well! to return. We started the next morning with some better roads and drove some distance when Mr
                    Pine who was driving the forward team came to a halt. He went forward and then halooed back that he
                    had come to the last jumping off place. All hands went forward. There was the bank of a small stream
                    thirty or forty feet high and so steep that it <pb n="20" id="VAA4025-061-1-024"/> seemed
                    impossiable to get down. When finally the ox team drove up Mr Pote, the teamster went forward and
                    looked at it. After examining it he told Mr Pine to take off the lead horse and drive his tongue
                    horses Then he brought one yoke of his oxen. He drove up behind turned the chain forward and
                    fastened it to the hind axel and then told the teamster to drive ahead. He held a gad in front of
                    the oxen and they laid back and fairly plowed the ground behind the wagon. He drove up. Took the
                    other yoke and let the second wagon down still changing teams. He finally let all down. He then put
                    one yoke to the stern of his own wagon and let himself down</p>
            <p>We traveled on for days not seeing a house. At night we ate our mush and warm rich milk. We all came
                    through fat. When comming down a bank to the bottom of a small stream called Sugar-creek [Sugar
                    Creek] the fore axel of uncle Jacob's wagon broke. Well there we were. There was neither
                    wagon maker nor smith within fifty miles that we knew of. The young man that was comming out to work
                    said if they would furnish the tools and help he would insure an axel that would stand the trip. No
                    iron was broken or bent. The axel broke in the center where the king bolt went through. A strate
                    young burdock<hi rend="sup">6</hi> about a foot through was cut down and shaped. This happened about
                    twelve</p>
            <p>We camped on the bank of the creek at a very shallow ripple with a gravel bottom. Right above was a
                    long strate sheet of water from three to six feet deep. There was not a snag in sight. It was fully
                    forty rods long and full of fish. My brother John and I had been at what they call brush draging for
                    fish in the Big Miama. I recollect of once seigning over four hundred. There were fifty men in that
                    drag. My brother John proposed making a brush drag at the upper end of the pond. The drag was made
                    by first getting long grape vines and stretching them clear across the creek, and then laying vines
                    crowsways every ten or twelve feet and then cut long brush and carefully lay it to lap over and tie
                    the vines so as to hold the brush together. When all was ready <list type="footnotes">

                    driver Mr Pope said that the oxen must be put to one end. The oxen were in the range not far off.
                    Soon the oxen were brought. It was a tall yoke. He took the gad, rode the nye ox, and took the dep
                    side. In several places the oxen nearly swam. It did not take long to draw the drag to the lower end
                    of the pond. The result was very nearly one hundred good suckers and red horse. There were several
                    pike in but they all leaped over as soon as it became as they thought dangerous. The oxen were
                    turned with their heads up stream and with our assistance we managed to get the drag back to the
                    head once more. The second draw we got upwards of forty. When we had all that we could make use of
                    we cleaned and salted and the wimen fried bountifully. That night and the next morning we had a
                    regular fish feast and plenty of fish for several days. The next morning when all was ready we took
                    the woods and some time within two or three days we came to a little improvement of Blue River and

                    hotels in those days) At this tavern we fell in with two Coutuckiens [Kentuckians] that had come to
                    see the country and had a two horse wagon and a barrel of whiskey to sell out to pay their expenses
                    In our crowd each family had a keg and had laid in a supply, but some of them thought that their
                    stock was running low so they bought several gallons. Our cag which held eight gallons was filled on
                    the Miami at eight cents a gallon. After our company got their supply we moved on. We camped that
                    night on Eagle Creek. I can not tell how long it took us to go from here to <placeName>

                    from under the log to warm. That was fearful news when the men came up. That night we got to Colonel

                    eleven A. M. we got to Perley Mitchells. Father and uncle knew Mr <placeName>

                    </placeName>. They had staid with him one year before when hunting for land. Mr. Mitchell took his
                    ax and pilloted us through about one mile due north. As this was Saturday we fixed to camp. In the
                    first place a brush shed was made till we could look out a building place which was soon done.</p>
            <p>I must here tell you how our first Sunday was spent. On Sunday morning there was a little frost. It
                    was a calm day in indian summer weather. After breakfast uncle Jacob, Mr Lingo (the man that came
                    out to work) and three of us boys took a path that led to a fish-trap that had been built that fall
                    on Sugar Creek about one mile morth west. The water was very low and clear. The fish dam was across
                    at a ripple twenty or thirty feet below the swallow rock. The swallow rock was so called from the
                    high rocks that were all along the shore, and thousands of swallows under the ledge of rocks that
                    stood over the water in places ten or twenty feet with tern feet of water under them. We worked
                    along to a level bend some ten feet above the water. Here there was room for a dozen persons to
                    stand. The brush dam that had been thrown across a short time before kept the fish from getting
                    down. To stand on this bend and look up and down such a sight of fish I had never seen before. Uncle
                    Jacob said that there were ten barrels of fish in sight all the time. The fish seemed tame. Some one
                    in the crowd had a cake in his pocket. He threw in bits and the fish would jump at it three or four
                    at a time. The black bass were the most active. My brother John had slipped a hook in his pocket. He
                    slipped out and cut a pole and turned over chunks and found plenty of black crickets. As he came
                    forward uncle Jacob said, "Give it to me. Give it to me." Uncle Jacob got hold of
                    the pole and in less than one half minute he drawed out twelve. They were all of the largest size.
                    The twelve waid fully fifty pounds. The thirteenth, a very large salmon broke the hook. We came home
                    with with twelve. It was a great surprise to mother and aunt Rachel. The two wimen were sisters and
                    very strict Sunday presbyterians. They hardly knew whether it would be right to eat them or not.
                    They finally concluded that as we were meedy and right in the woods it might be considered a
                    mecessity. Father said. "I will risk it any how." From that time us four boys made
                    a regular business of fishing every Sunday till after the rains swelled the creek and let the fish
                    down.</p>

            <p>Fish were unusally plenty both in the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> and Sugar creek. It is almost
                    too strong for the people of this day to beleave, but it is mone the less true. Even on the riffles
                    of Big Leatherwood in the spring fish could be taken by the thousand.</p>

                    stream in western Indiana. There are nearly all the way high rocks on one or the other side and
                    sometimes on both sides as it is at the narrows and Rockpoart [<placeName>

                    narrow It is from three quarters to a mile wide and the scenery in many places is far ahead of any
                    that is seen along the creek such as Turkeyrun [<placeName>

                    the greatest delight in examining these rocks. We would start after breakfast on Sunday and

            <p>Our trip from Ohio was in time seventeen days. In all that time there was not a drop of rain and for
                    two weeks after we arrived there was fine indian summer weather.</p>

                    good horses well harnessed, a good wagon and the family were all well clad. That was in 1816. We had
                    $1100 with $330 still behind. After our arrival here we had three horses two

                    horse belonging to each family wore a bell, and a clog on its foot. They made their living in the
                    woods. We could not afford corn for them for that would have taken the bread from the family. There
                    was one hundred bushels carefully stored over head in our cabin. That had to last till ground could
                    be cleared and a crop raised. Corn could be bought for twenty cents a bushel but we had little
                    money. Pork was $2.00 a hundred. When our pork and corn was laid in and our cabin was in

            <p>Our cattle and horses gave us some trouble. They would stroll off through the woods and not return.
                    Father told me to take care of the cattle and not let them get out of hearing of the bell. I was
                    only thirteen years old and no woodsman. Mother was very much afraid that I would get lost and have
                    to lie out. I was some of the same opinion but pretended to be under no fear and that was
                    strengthened by some remark of my having Sugar creek to the morth west and Leatherwood all around
                    us. I was told if I got lost to follow any of the branches down and it would bring me out at Mr
                    Mitchels one mile south of our house. I had an ax and I thought if I would blaze the trees in a
                    strate line morth west, and another morth east it might save me at some time. Once in a while I put
                    a notch on the side next to home.</p>

                    supplies</p>
            <p>There were no mills mearer than Roseville. At Roseville the mill was so crowded with customers that
                    there could not be a grist ground in less than a week at any time that winter. They would swop a
                    bushel of meal for a bushel of corn. They took more than one third for grinding. The corn wayed
                    fifty six pounds and the meal thirty six. Father said that we must make some other arraingment to
                    grind our corn. He talked of a hand mill but there were no burs in the country and if there had been
                    we had no money with which to buy. We came to the conclusion to try the homeny block. Nearly every
                    squatter in Yanketown had his own mill. We sawed off a <pb n="25" id="VAA4025-061-1-029"/>

                    in the middle with a two inch auger to the debth that we wanted the bowl. Then five or six holes
                    were boared not quite so deep with the same auger. Then holes were made with a one inch auger as
                    close as they could be boared. After this a fire and dry chips were applied. We put ashes on the rim
                    to keep it from burning. After it fed some time and became hot a portion of wood was laid on and a
                    rock was put on the top. Then all was covered and left to fume in coal pit fashion. We soon had a
                    mortar. When this was set in a sutable place with a pestel hung to the end of a pole the mill was
                    finished Father told me to take charge of the mill and see to the stock, and John and himself would
                    stick to the clearing. Father never got discouraged. He said that it was the best one hundred sixty
                    acres of land that was in all that part of the country and if we only made a living for a year or
                    two we would have in a very short time one of the best farms in the neighborhood which was the case.</p>

                    have done by nine A. M. As the cattle were pounded at night, after being milked in the morning and
                    let out, they would take a strate line and hardly stop till they went one or two miles. After the
                    corn was pounded and enough meal sifted to make a cake I would start with a rifle on my shoulder to
                    see to the cattle. I usually went out one mile east to a rise on the bank of Leatherwood where
                    Kersey Newlins house now stands. There I would sit on a log and listen for the bell. After a time I
                    would make a start in some other direction and if the cattle were found feeding quietly I would
                    start home and if the weather was good would not start out again till about three o'clock.
                    I would not drive the cows in till sun down. As a great portion of our living was from the milk of
                    the cows, it was necessary that they should pasture late. After hard freezing weather which there
                    was a very long spell of in the first of winter the cattle fed on a kind of winter grass that was
                    very abundant in wet places. All through the woods there were fields of it. When it was <pb n="27" id="VAA4025-061-1-031"/> raised up it would be all perfectly green and knee high. In February
                    and March of 1824 there was considerable snow. There was so much that the cattle could not get
                    grass. Then we had to chop down sugar, beech, elm and lin and the cattle would eat of the tops and
                    small limbs. They would chew off limbs of elm and lin as thick as ones finger. The horses would gnaw
                    off the bark of slippery elm till they had the bodies of the trees entirely peeled.</p>
            <p>In April 1824 the cattle were all in tolerably good order. We had seven calves. The trouble was all
                    over for as the calves were kept in a yard the cows came up regularly at night. Our living depended
                    very much on the milk. That summer we made forty cheeses of the milk of seven cows. The average
                    weight of the cheeses was about twelve pounds. I was market= boy and sold the most of the cheese at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Armeysberg. Armeysberg or Stringtown was at that time county seat. The first
                    celebration of the fourth of July was held at Armeysberg in the year 1824.</p>
            <p>Butter and cheese was eight and a third cents a pound and eggs were four cents a dozen. In the summer
                    corn got up to twenty five cents when sold by the small lots and carried in sacks. Salt was one
                    dollar a bushel. Coffee was from twenty five to thirty cents. Tea was one dollar and fifty to two
                    dollars a pound. Common shirting sold at twenty five or thirty cents a yard. Cambric sold at fifty
                    and sixty cents a yard. Leather was too high for any common people to wear more than one pair of
                    shoes in a year.</p>
            <p>We were all common folks and enjoyed ourselves as well in our buckskins as the people of this day doe
                        <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> in their finest apperel. I recollect of wearing one pair of buckskins
                    winter and summer Sundays and all times for two years. I first learned to dance in those old organs
                    Organs was the common name of buck skin pants.</p>
            <p>This was in squatter times. Squatters never got to be old settlers. They followed the indians and
                    lived on locusts and wild honey like Eligah [Elijah] the Tishbite did eighteen hundred years ago.</p>
            <p>Father bought a few pigs in February and kept them a few weeks but had to turn them out on account of
                    the scarcity of feed. The shotes ran off in the woods and were not seen for months. At last they
                    came by the house with a neighbor's <pb n="28" id="VAA4025-061-1-032"/> hogs. It was a fine
                    mast year. About Christmas the hogs came through the lane and we got them fine and fat at a small
                    cost.</p>
            <p>I now turn back to the fall before. Father, brother John, and a hand that worked week about for
                    father and uncle Jacob at eight dollars a month lost no time during the fall and winter that was fit
                    for them to work out. In the spring they had fifteen acres cleared of all the smaller timber and
                    they had two hundred rales scattered all over the clearing. Then came the heavy work of rolling and
                    burning logs and hailing rails and making fences. That could have been done in time for a good crop
                    if it had not been for the wet weather. They would roll logs in the mud and fire up and the rain
                    would put them out before the next morning. On the 12th of June we commenced planting by plowing one
                    furrow every four feet and then step drop every three or four feet. We finished planting corn on the
                    18th of June. We then went through the rows and broke the ground. After that was done we plowed and
                    planted one acre of potatoes. After that was done we cleared one acre and sowed turnips. The result
                    of all was a fine crop of soft corn.</p>
            <p>The corn was gathered and sorted into three sorts. The best was for bread. The second was for horses.
                    The third which was soft corn that had been injured by the frost was for the cows. All the corn was
                    put in cribs two feet wide.</p>
            <p>Potatoes and turnips were both good. The potatoes yielded two hundred and fifty or three hundred
                    bushels to the acre. There were two or three hundred bushels of turnips and there was no sale for
                    either potatoes or turnips. There were no new settlers till the fall of 1826.</p>
            <p>Potatoes and turnips are both good feed for milk cows. We milked four in the winter of 1824 and 1825.
                    They were fed almost altogether on potatoes and turnips and the result was that we had all the milk
                    and butter that the family could use and some for sale. The cows came out fat in the spring.</p>
            <p>Sugar was made by all the farmers There was not a single eighty acre lot that lacked in sugartrees
                    that were sufficient for one or two camps. The first season we made three hundred and fifty pounds
                    of sugar and ten gallons of molasses on the same ground that we were clearing for corn. <pb n="29" id="VAA4025-061-1-033"/> We made sugar for sale every year for a number of years. It was only
                    worth from eight to ten cents a pound.</p>
            <p>After the first year I never saw any scarcety of provisions. The only complaint was that there was
                    nobody to whome the supplies could be sold.</p>
            <p>Continuation of the narative of Andrew Ten Brook on the early settlement of Parke county or Reserve
                    township. 1826 was about the time that the first settlers commenced comming in north and east of us.
                    At that time we had little to sell and in almost all cases the settlers had only money enough to
                    merely buy their land. They depended on getting their meat out of the woods and the only bread that
                    they had was made of corn. Father got a good deal of work done in the clearing and rail making for
                    two bushels of corn for a days work</p>
            <p>In about 1827 after the corn was planted we had a potato patch to clear. Near the first of June two
                    men came from Sandcreek [Sand Creek] with their axes on their shoulders and wanted to work for
                    potatoes. We set in five hands in a deadning of as good land as we had. It was then the first of
                    June and in the right time in the moon and the seighn was right on Friday and Saturday. When we came
                    in to dinner on the second day after commenceing the clearing mother said that we must try hard to
                    get the potatoes planted that week; for it was new moon on Sunday and potatoes never did any good
                    that were planted in the new moon. I recollect that father's answer was "I never
                    plant potatoes in the moon or in the seighns. It is impossible to get the logs rolled and burned and
                    the ground plowed and in good order in less than two weeks." Mother said "Well? we
                    will have no potatoes" Uncle Jacob Ten Brook's farm joined ours. The two men were
                    brothers and the wimen were sisters. Uncle was in the same fix that year that we were. A potato
                    patch was to be cleared after corn was planted, but uncles situation was very different from ours in
                    one respect. He started a small tanyard and all the neighbors were owing him for leather. They sent
                    around and got a number of hands and their potatoes were planted in the right time of the moon. We
                    worked and two weeks later our patch was planted in good order but exactly in the wrong time of the
                    moon. It was very dry in August and uncle's potatoes were in blossom. Ours were still
                    small. After <pb n="30" id="VAA4025-061-1-034"/> their potatoes were far spent rain came in time to
                    make ours. At digging time both crops were measured. Theirs that were planted in the moon turned out
                    three hundred bushels to the acre and ours that were planted in the ground averaged three hundred
                    and fifty bushels to the acre.</p>
            <p>We still worked on improving and clearing land and raising crops and selling what we could to new
                    settlers and takeing work for what we sold. We gave two bushels of corn or potatoes for a days work
                    and boarded the hand. We also raised and prepared flax for the spinning wheel. At this time was the
                    expression first used "Root pig or die." We rooted and lived and father said if we
                    could only make a little and lay it out in land while land was only $1.25 an acre we
                    would be making money fast. In ten years we bought two eighty acre lots. One of them has sold since
                    for $4500 in cash.</p>
            <p>Settlers came in fast and we had no trouble in selling our wheat at fifty cents a bushel. We sold
                    thirty bushels to Greenbury Ward's father. He paid $15 in silver. That was the
                    largest sum that we had received after we came to the country. We did not want much money. I have in
                    my possession a tax receipt of that day for one hundred and sixty acres of land, seventeen head of
                    cattle and some hogs and sheep $2,60 in full and seighned A. M. Puett.</p>

            <p>Indiana contributed more than any other state to the building of the legend that the Knights of the
                    Golden Circle, as a subversive society, existed in the upper Middle West during the Civil War years.
                    No one in Indiana made as great a contribution to the Golden Circle fantasy as Henry B. Carrington,
                    onetime politician, soldier, and man of letters.</p>
            <p>When Governor Oliver P. Morton appointed Carrington, in midyear of 1862, to speed up the recruitment
                    and organization of Indiana troops, the ex-Ohioan could look back upon an active and checkered
                    career. He had practiced law in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, with considerable success. He had dabbled
                    in the study of military tactics, contributing a guide on regulations and troop maneuvers. He had
                    become an avowed abolitionist and had helped to bring the Republican party into being in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Then, when William Dennison had become governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, he had named Carrington, a onetime law partner, as his adjutant general. The
                    highhanded tactics of the two created considerable resentment and also ruffled the feelings of the
                    Secretary of War.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Carrington defied the orders of Secretary Simon Cameron, for
                    he organized more regiments than <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s quota early in 1861. When David Tod replaced Dennison in the
                    governor's chair early in 1862, Carrington sought an army commission; and he received the
                    colonelcy of the Eighteenth Regiment, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

            <p>Even before Carrington came to Indiana, stories of Golden Circle activity had circulated throughout
                    the country. War psychosis enabled the gullible to see fact in fiction and to build mountains out of
                    molehills. Tales of Golden Circle activity dated back to the prewar years and revolved around the
                    name of George W. L. Bickley, charlatan extraordinary and whimsical wanderer. Bickley drifted to <placeName>

                    lawyer, lecturer, doctor, editor, and promoter. He married a widow and lost favor when he tried to
                    transfer her property into his own name. Then, in 1859, he served as midwife to the Knights of the
                    Golden Circle, bringing the organization into being with his pen and his imagination, and hoping to
                    pyramid a fortune out of ten-dollar membership fees. He devised a ritual and a great seal,

                    importance in Kentucky which it never had. The three expositions, broadcast over the upper Midwest,

            <p>The appearance of John C. Brain in Indiana in September, 1861, gave further publicity to the Knights

                    </placeName> before trying to ply his trade in Laporte County, Indiana. One of Brain's many
                    claims was that he was a K.G.C. agent with the duty of securing revolvers and volunteers for the
                    Southern army. He also claimed that the <placeName>

            <p>Reports of activity of the Knights of the Golden Circle also floated in on the winds of rumor from

                    After the election returns were in, it developed that the Ohio expose was compounded of false
                    affidavits, bogus oaths, and forged letters—simply "a diabolical electioneering

                    society for the purpose of opposing the war had been organized in Indiana. In March, 1862, Sulgrove
                    again aired M.P.S. charges and flatly asserted that "a secret treasonable league exists in

            <p>The grand jury report was as strange as the "Judge Hughes Letter." It too bore the
                    marks of partisanship. All fourteen members of the grand jury (District Court of the <placeName>

                    federal marshal impaneled the jury, and an active Republican party member directed the probe. More
                    than a hundred persons appeared before the grand jury to testify on a dozen different matters
                    —from corruption to murder to disloyalty. The grand jury returned forty-seven
                    indictments—none however for participation in secret society activity—and then
                    the jurymen tacked on an <hi rend="i">obiter dictum</hi> of their own creation. The incidental
                    opinion, unrelated to the indictments presented, dealt with the activity of the Knights of the
                    Golden Circle in Indiana. The strange report suggested that fifteen thousand Hoosiers belonged to
                    treasonable organizations—strongest in those counties which failed to furnish a fair
                    proportion of volunteers. It supposed that many rebels in the Confederate armies also belonged to
                    the K.G.C. and that some of the Confederate prisoners held in Camp Morton evidently belonged to the
                    order. It suggested that members of the Golden Circle who met on the battlefields deliberately
                    "shot over each others' heads." Northerners who were K.G.C. members
                    belonged to "dens" or "castles" and bore sidearms when attending
                    meetings in "bye places"—sometimes in the woods and sometimes in
                    deserted houses. The Golden Circle, the <hi rend="i">obiter dictum</hi> report concluded,
                    "is a place where treason is concocted—the nest where traitors were
                    hatched." The report admitted that <list type="footnotes">

                    the orders to be superior to their civil oaths. The lack of cooperation of some witnesses was taken
                    as proof of the complicity of the witnesses in the serpentine societies. The jurymen, therefore,
                    used the lack of proof as evidence that the K.G.C. existed in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                    that the "partisan document" was intended to discredit the Democratic party. He
                    was positive that it was no coincidence that the grand jury report was published while the

            <p>Democratic members of the state legislature inadvertently played into the hands of Carrington,
                    Sulgrove, and Morton by tabling resolutions "to investigate the facts in relation to said
                    secret organizations." Democratic legislators viewed an investigation as a device to turn
                    attention from the burning issues of the day—abolitionism and the centralization of
                    government. Furthermore, since a grand jury was being organized, such an inquiry fell within its
                    jurisdiction. Instead of smoking out the rumors, Democratic legislators shelved the resolutions to
                    investigate the secret societies—giving Republicans thereafter an opportunity to claim

                    encourage "the desertion of soldiers and their arms." He recited instances of
                    violence and defiance which he linked to the Golden Circle. He wrote at length about supposed oaths,
                    signs, passwords, degrees, and objectives of the K.G.C. He charged that, "about the time of
                    the draft," Knights of the Golden Circle organized "to break up the
                    army." Morton's right bower wrote, "The fact is that the <hi rend="i">order</hi> has <hi rend="i">grown faster</hi> than the party leaders wished and has assumed a

                    draft, Carrington and Morton tried to sell the same bill of goods to Indiana residents. The two
                    called a council of prominent citizens, including some Democratic leaders, and set March 21 as the
                    date to discuss the state of affairs and to consider measures "to soothe the popular
                    excitement." Governor Morton was "unwell" on the day scheduled for the
                    meeting, so Carrington took charge of the conference. He reported, with a straight face, that
                    "27,000 arms," mostly revolvers, had been imported into Indiana by secret society
                    members and that a civil war loomed on the horizon. Carrington expressed a desire to draft an
                    address, urging citizens to accept the draft, obey the laws, and respect his military
                        proclamations.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> The Democratic members who attended the conference believed
                    that Carrington exaggerated for effect, and they refused to subscribe to the tales about Golden
                    Circle activity.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Carrington, nevertheless, promised that he would have an

                    Carrington urged them to sign the address he had prepared. The Democratic members disagreed with
                    Carrington's contentions and criticized the address as partisan and untrue—based
                    upon fiction rather than fact. Even though Carrington amended the document, the Democratic members
                    still refused to add their signatures to the proposed public statement.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> They

                    Since the War Department had no confidence in Carrington, Major General Henry W. Halleck, general in

            <p>In July, 1863, two events alarmed Indiana citizens and gave widespread publicity to the Knights of
                    the Golden Circle, seeming to give some substance to the Carrington-Morton contentions that a
                    subversive society existed in the Hoosier State. The first of the two events took the form of
                    General John H. Morgan's invasion of Indiana. The rebel raiders crossed the <geogName>Ohio
                        River</geogName> on July 8 and headed for Corydon, collecting horses on the way.
                    Morgan's men routed local legionnaires and kept Indiana authorities guessing as to their

                            inefficiency." In published form (with changes made to save Carrington's

                    papers. Bickley again blatantly denied any knowledge of the Golden Circle, but the contents of his
                    trunk proved he was a brazen liar. The agent put Bickley in handcuffs and took him to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where he was confined in a military prison. Authorities listed the items found in

                    of letters, newspaper clippings, three packages of powder (later analyzed as gum gambage, opium, and
                    rhubarb), a pamphlet containing the rules and regulations of the K.G.C., words to a song entitled

            <p>Federal officials released news of Bickley's arrest to the press; and Republican editors
                    made the most of the story, using it to buttress the K.G.C. tales they had circulated earlier.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> Carrington, of course, used Bickley's arrest as proof that his
                    K.G.C. contentions were valid and that his Golden Circle tales had a truthful base. By setting foot
                    upon Indiana soil in July of 1863, Bickley inadvertently aided Morton and Carrington in developing
                    the legend that a subversive society, widespread and dangerous, existed in Indiana.</p>
            <p>As interparty bitterness increased in Indiana and as Governor Morton outwitted and out-maneuvered

                    and to counteract the activities of the Union League. Dodd hoped that his paper-based organization
                    would become an agency through which Peace Democrats might bring about the nomination of a
                    "Peace" man in 1864. Dodd's creation, the Sons of Liberty, was in no way

                    secretly managed by the K.G.C." The imaginative affiant, a former Ohio resident, even
                    claimed that he had been offered the command of one hundred men to help in bringing Clement L.

            <p>The Knights of the Golden Circle, then, existed more in fancy than in fact. It was a pre-war,
                    paper-based creation which George W. L. Bickley hoped would bring him fame and fortune. But Bickley
                    had neither the ability nor the character nor the resources to make his dream come true. Carrington
                    and Morton seized upon on opportunity—and a climate produced by war
                    psychosis—to transform a name into a bogeyman, bringing a Civil War myth into being.
                    Wartime charges that Knights of the Golden Circle existed in Indiana appear to disintegrate under
                    close scrutiny through the historical microscope. Evidence discovered to date fails to convince the

                    </placeName>, near the beginning of the year 1839, Sara Ames Stebbins poured out her heart in a
                    delicate handwriting on pale blue paper to her mother-in-law, Lois Stebbins. The letter presumably

                    </placeName>, its final destination, several weeks later. Two points make the document remarkable:
                    the poignant loneliness of Mrs. Stebbins and her praise of the frontier region in which she lived.
                    These characteristics were doubtless common to the western immigrants, whatever the frontier area in

                    later date than this letter. Uncle Clesson, married to Mehit-able Stebbins, was Lansford's

                    </placeName>–both under George Rapp's and Robert Owen's
                    influence–has captivated the American imagination for the past century and a quarter.
                    Until now it has been hard to bring this community into full focus–partly because of the
                    nature of the social philosophies of the two principal figures associated with its management and
                    partly because of the host of other individuals associated with the venture. If there ever was a
                    place on the older frontier where an idyllic Utopia centering about a single social philosophy might
                    flourish, the banks of the Wabash in the first quarter of the nineteenth century was that place.</p>
            <p>It is fortunate that William E. Wilson interested himself in the wrtiing of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> story. First, he is well attuned to the environmental conditions and history of the
                    Wabash country. Second, he took his time to collect evidence and to draw the two diverse and complex
                    stories together in one book as they should be. Rapp's Harmonie community and
                    Owen's Community of Equality presented a single desire for isolation and social and
                    intellectual cohesiveness.</p>
            <p>The author searched the records. George Rapp's history in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, and in Indiana is a rather full one. Austerely religious, domineeering as a leader,
                    and quite successful as a communal leader, Rapp achieved notable results at Harmonie. The buildings,
                    the home industry, and the way of life there were remarkable. There can be little doubt but what the
                    Rappites had an impact on frontier Indiana, even to taking some part in the organization of the
                    state itself.</p>
            <p>An unusual number of early travelers visited Harmonie and made comments upon it. The serpent appeared
                    among the angels, as Professor Wilson says, when money became involved; and some of the travelers
                    noted this fact. This was certainly true when on January 2, 1825, Robert Owen, the Welshman who had
                    prospered as mill master, purchased from Frederick Rapp for approximately $125,000 to
                    $190,000 the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>
                    </placeName> holdings of the Harmonists.</p>
            <p>The author presents Owen in a remarkably clear character analysis. It is a truly amazing fact in
                    British industrial history that the Welshman was so successful. Perhaps he succeeded because in his
                    early years he attended to business. His performances in America could well have set the stage for
                    Colonel Sellers in Mark Twain's writings. Intoxicated with the idea of communal equality he
                    appeared never to have taken time to think anything through. Even his sons could never bring him
                    down to earth. No better illustration of this man's wild dreams could be produced than the
                    drawing of the elaborate quadrangle of buildings which Owen called the Phalanstery. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> he became intoxicated with his dream.</p>
            <p>The heart of the story of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> lay not with the obsessed Owen, but with the diverse collection of human beings who
                    came <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-061-1-064"/> to share in the freedom of the Wabash Elysium. Among these
                    were Charles-Alexander Lesueur, Thomas Say, Guillaume Sylvan Casimir Phiquepal d' Arusmont,
                    Joseph Neef, Gerard Troost, William Maclure, Frances Wright, and Madame Marie Duclos Fretageot. The
                    four sons of Robert Owen presented a somewhat soberer aspect to the personal picture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. American cultural and intellectual history would not have been so rich had some of the

               <hi rend="i">The Angel and the Serpent</hi> has a ring of genuine authenticity. Romance and color did
                    not seduce the author away from fact. The research was broad and searching. Most important the two
                    stories of the Wabash utopia are laid side by side, not so much in contrast as in relationship. It
                    matters little whether the angel or the serpent won– maybe the expanding Indiana frontier
                    swallowed the angel after all.</p>

            <p>Occasionally every reviewer is happily surprised to discover significance in a book beyond his
                    expectations. This is such an instance. Wayne E. Fuller has convincingly and skillfully shown that
                    the coming of rural free delivery was a highly important element in the social and economic
                    transformation of American agriculture between the 1890's and 1930. Based on the postal
                    records of the National Archives and a considerable body of other source materials, the book is a
                    striking illustration of the unrealized opportunities which still exist in the field of American
                    agricultural history.</p>
            <p>Fuller cautiously refrains from singling out any one father of rural free delivery. The proposal for
                    such service gained currency in the years of agricultural unrest between 1868 and 1896, and John
                    Wanamaker endorsed the idea while postmaster general in the Harrison administration. The lame duck
                    session of the Fifty-Second Congress appropriated $10,000 for experimentation. RFD became
                    a permanent part of the postal system during the late 1890's and entered a decade of very
                    rapid expansion in 1903, despite the misgivings of many about the cost and in spite of the
                    opposition of fourth class postmasters, rural merchants, and star route contractors. Politicians
                    quickly divined the possibilities in the rural free delivery routes; and it was no accident that the
                    region with the greatest concentration of routes in 1912 was the Middle West, the great stronghold
                    of rural Republicanism. Even more rural but unfortunately more Democratic, the South was much less
                    well endowed.</p>
            <p>Rural free delivery, Fuller suggests, was intimately related to the good roads movement, to the
                    coming of the parcel post, to the antagonisms between the village merchants and the population of
                    the open country, and to the breaking down of rural isolation. Yet RFD did have its problems and
                    failed ingloriously when eager administrators <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-061-1-065"/> tried to use it to
                    displace the middlemen between the rural food producer and the urban consumer. As befits the son of
                    a rural mail carrier, Fuller devotes considerable attention to the physical facts of mail carriage,
                    to the passing of the horse and the coming of the tin lizzie, and to the progress and problems of
                    the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association.</p>
            <p>It is perhaps ungrateful to wish that a book which gives so much could have given somewhat more.
                    Although the opponents of raral free delivery in the local communities were deftly identified, their
                    spokesmen in Congress were much less clearly described; the book exhibits little evidence of
                    systematic roll call analysis. In general, the narrative is extremely lucid, and Fuller merits
                    praise for his attention to style. Sometimes, however, the story seems almost too folksy, too simple
                    in its explanations of causes and motives, and too frequently sprinkled with superlatives. To one
                    who has read midwestern farm diaries of the late nineteenth century, Fuller's picture of
                    rural isolation seems overdrawn, although it may indeed be highly applicable to western regions and
                    to portions of the South.</p>

            <p>Thomas Douglas, seventh son of Dunbar <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> (Douglas), Fourth Earl of Selkirk, appears at least briefly in many books dealing with
                    the Great Lakes and Upper <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. He is portrayed as a Scottish nobleman who tries to colonize this region, and his
                    colony becomes involved in the bitter struggle for control of the region on the part of the
                    Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest Company. Eventually there occurs the Battle of Seven
                    Oaks, the seizure of Fort Williams by Lord Selkirk, and a variety of legal proceedings which are
                    decided against Douglas. The trouble ends when the warring companies merge in 1821, Selkirk having
                    died the preceding year.</p>
            <p>John Morgan Gray, long associated with the Macmillan Company of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> Limited, undertook the present book because of an interest in Lord Selkirk and because
                    of a "wish to get at the truth of his motives in forwarding <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Highland</settlement>
                    </placeName> emigration." He began with the impression that Selkirk "had had less
                    than justice from the courts of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and perhaps from posterity" (Preface). This impression becomes a thesis which
                    is presented most convincingly. Hence the emphasis is on the Canadian aspect of Douglas'
                    life.</p>
            <p>Lord Selkirk's humanitarianism was expressed in many interests, but particularly in
                    connection with a variety of colonizing projects. At first he proposed to Lord Pelham in 1802 a
                    scheme for Irish emigration. For the rest of his life, however, he was primarily concerned with
                    founding colonies in America for Scottish Highlanders. He traveled extensively in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> during his two trips to <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-061-1-066"/> America, 1803-1804 and
                    1815-1819. (In the winter of 1817-1818 he traveled overland from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, stopping overnight at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> about the middle of November.) His colonies included a successful venture at Prince
                    Edward's Island (1803), a failure at Baldoon on Lake St. Clair (1804), and Red River
                    (1811), which in time became Winnipeg.</p>
            <p>Lord Selkirk appears first to have heard of the Red River region about 1801. He explored
                    unsuccessfully with the British Colonial Office the possibility of the government's setting
                    aside the charter claims of the Hudson's Bay Company which limited access to Red River.
                    Although he then turned his attention to the Prince Edward's Island and Baldoon colonies,
                    he did not forget Red River.</p>
            <p>Finally he conceived the idea of buying stock in the Hudson's Bay Company, securing a grant
                    of land, and proceeding with a third colony. His temporary partner in the purchase of stock was Sir
                    Alexander Mackenzie, acting in behalf of the Northwest Company. Possibly because of different
                    objectives Selkirk and Mackenzie soon came to a parting. The former continued to purchase stock,
                    however, as did his brother-in-law, Andrew Colvile, and John Halkett, who married Douglas'
                    sister, Katherine, in 1815. By 1810 they owned stock valued at more than 12,000 pounds, far short of
                    majority control of a company which had capital in excess of 100,000 pounds.</p>
            <p>Selkirk's colonizing project was submitted to the Committee of the Hudson's Bay
                    Company in February, 1811, including a request for a grant of land for a nominal price. Eventually
                    the decision was favorable, and Selkirk received a grant of 116,000 acres in June, 1811. Henceforth
                    the personal affairs of Selkirk and of the Hudson Company were so intermingled, that many persons
                    assumed he exercised a controlling interest. It was on this basis that later difficulties could be
                    explained by his enemies as rivalry between two fur trading companies, which often acted in
                    extra-legal fashion.</p>
            <p>Space does not permit even an outline of the travails of the Red River colony or its battles with the
                    Northwest Company, which finally resulted in endless litigation. The author places some of the blame
                    for the difficulties on Lord Selkirk. He notes that Selkirk should have realized that "he
                    was confronting a dynamic trading organization placed in an intolerable situation." Gray
                    remarks that Douglas' contemporaries were puzzled that "his affairs, the great
                    venture of his life, should drift into an unmanageable chaos." He concludes that
                    Selkirk's impulses "were linked with a lucid brain at once capable of directing
                    intricate matters on a large scale and of making mistakes that lesser men would not have
                    made" (p. 75). The author advances the theory that Douglas was guilty, for the most part,
                    of misdemeanors; the Northwest Company of felonies. Unfortunately the Canadian courts, which are
                    severely criticized, tended to assess almost equal blame and arrived at decisions (after
                    interminable delays) from which Lord Selkirk finally appealed to Parliament. By the time he returned
                    to Europe he was a dying man. At his death his estate had debts of 160,000 pounds and stock in the
                    Hudson's Bay Company which was worth about 26,000 pounds. The author concludes that Lord
                    Selkirk <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-061-1-067"/> has earned a "place among the great experiments
                    in colonization; along side <placeName>

                    appendixes, index. $6.95.)</head>
            <p>This book, as indicated in the Preface, is essentially a series of papers on various topics of
                    regional development organized under the direction of the Wabash Valley Advisory Committee and
                    presented at the University of Illinois during 1961-1962. The papers were discussed in seminars and
                    revised for publication, and Wabash Valley Advisory Committee members then submitted other essays to
                    augment those presented by persons outside the university. Fifteen authors, representing various
                    fields, contributed the fourteen chapters of which the book is composed. Each chapter is well
                    written, completely documented, and cartographically well illustrated. The final chapter is devoted
                    in part to the application of the technique of linear programing.</p>
            <p>Although this brief book consists of four parts, its contents divide in a more natural fashion into
                    chapters on regional development and chapters on the Wabash Basin, as the title of the book implies.
                    Some of the development chapters make no reference to the Wabash whatsoever, and even their
                    applications to the Midwest do not seem to be appropriate. The conflicts in water use in the Pacific
                    Northwest on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Snake rivers seem to be a far cry from the Wabash although water is, no doubt,
                    the basic problem in both areas. Likewise Montana appears to be geographically out of phase with the
                    Midwest.</p>
            <p>The several chapters on the general economy, agriculture, industry, and recreation of the Wabash
                    Basin are well written and developed in detail to the county level by several authors, all highly
                    trained geographers. All of them, as well as other contributors, question the regionality of the
                    Basin. "It is difficult to assess the economic merits of the Wabash Basin for yet another
                    reason–the Basin is a poor geographic region for economic analysis" (p. 11).
                    Various authors refer to the lack of either homogeneous or nodal characteristics, to the lack of a
                    regional capital, and to the lack of rank-size gradation of cities and towns which would be expected
                    if the Basin were a homogeneous region. It is also pointed out (pp. 34-35) that the railroads in the
                    area are related to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> rather than to the Wabash Basin.</p>
            <p>The one item of unity is water–the drainage basin of the Wabash River; and as such, the
                    problem of flood control, especially in the lower <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-061-1-068"/> reaches of the
                    valley, is the special province of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army Corps of Engineers as presented in Chapter 11. In Chapter 12, "Water
                    Management and the Wabash Basin," several multi-purpose river developments are cited such
                    as the Miami Conservancy District, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Hoover Commissions, and the
                    Select Committee on National Water Resources. The Delaware and Potomac basins are projected as
                    examples of the new integrated water resource planning of the Department of Agriculture's
                    small watershed program, together with the water supply, recreation, flood control, and navigation
                    responsibilities of the Corps of Engineers. Chapter 12 also presents the concept of multi-purpose
                    and comprehensive planning. Most of the thinking is based directly upon water management and related
                    land resources such as flood, water supply and quality, sediment abatement, improved drainage, water
                    recreation, fish and wild life, nature preservation, navigation, hydroelectric power, waste
                    disposal, irrigation needs, and industrial use of water. It is Chapter 12 that best summarizes the
                    purpose of the entire book, after giving credit to the Wabash Valley Association and the Corps of
                    Engineers, "the problem facing the Wabash Basin is to create and execute a plan considering
                    and including all the uses to which its natural resources may be applied while bringing together in
                    coordination the points of view of all users of these resources … when the plans
                    … are prepared they will be applicable uniquely to the Wabash and to no other area,
                    because no two watersheds are alike" (p. 177). Obviously this could be Volume I in a long
                    series of plans and studies, especially in view of the lack of regional homogeneity in the Wabash
                    Basin.</p>

            <p>This book provides the first full-length treatment of Edward H. Crump, the power of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> politics from the Progressive period until the late 1940's. Professor Miller,
                    the author of a previous book on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the Progressive era, brings to his subject extensive knowledge of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> politics and society. He has also used Crump's personal papers and has
                    interviewed many of Crump's relatives, friends, and former political associates.</p>
            <p>In Miller's view Crump emerges as a progressive businessman-politician not unlike others of
                    the period. As mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1909 to 1915 Crump provided honest, efficient, and economical government. He tried
                    also to aid the Negro population by improving park facilities and health services. As a boss in
                    subsequent years Crump did not rely upon graft but upon Negro voters and upon financial
                    contributions of businessmen grateful for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName>' orderly politics, excellent public services, and low tax rates. Miller also
                    stresses Crump's loyalty to the New Deal, his love of the TVA, and his hatred of private
                    power <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-061-1-069"/> interests. Miller also points out that Crump outlived his
                    time: in 1948, for instance, he supported the Dixiecrat ticket and denounced (unsuccessfully)
                    senatorial candidate Estes Kefauver as a tool of Communism. The reader interested in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Tennessee politics will find this book informative.</p>
            <p>The author's reliance upon scraps of information in Crump's papers, however, leads
                    to two weaknesses. First, Miller's judgments too often reflect uncritically the pro-Crump
                    views of his sources. The author maintains that Crump was "truthful" in denying
                    "direct knowledge" of the means used to register Negro voters (p. 103). Given
                    Crump's detailed knowledge concerning other phases of Tennessee politics, this assertion is
                    debatable at best. Similarly, Miller does not try to determine the extent of ballot-box stuffing by
                    the Crump machine. Finally, the reader finds Crump called upon to "engineer a
                    compromise" to determine the House leadership in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1933. Crump had no such authority; and the man named majority leader was Joseph
                    Byrns of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, not Byrnes, as the author (and his source, the notes of Crump's secretary)
                    would have us believe (p. 179) .</p>
            <p>Second, Miller is unable to resist trivia. The reader is regaled (p. 39) with love letters from
                    various suitors to Crump's future wife; he reads (pp. 125-26) letters from an aide of
                    Crump's describing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in World War I; and he is told (p. 169) that Crump's sons loved their parents.
                    Yet these passages give no insight, respectively, into the character of Mrs. Crump, into
                    Crump's views on World War I, or into Crump as a parent. These and similar passages might
                    better have been omitted.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Talkative President: The Off-the-Record Press Conferences of Calvin
                    Coolidge.</hi> Edited by Howard H. Quint and Robert H. Ferrell. (Amherst: The University of
                    Massachusetts Press, 1964. Pp. xi, 276. Index. $6.00.)</head>
            <p>"Silent Cal" Coolidge has never been an easy man to interpret. His personal papers
                    in the Library of Congress are disappointingly thin, while his published writings run to the
                    platitudinous and didactic. Had he nothing to say? Was he a virtual nonentity? Biographies by
                    William Allen White and Claude M. Fuess (written about twenty-five years ago) are excellent in some
                    respects, and they reject so critical a view of Coolidge. The present volume affords the best
                    opportunity yet to appraise his ideas on a variety of subjects. Having learned of
                    Coolidge's off-the-record press conferences, the editors succeeded in finding typed
                    transcripts deposited in the Forbes Library in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Northampton</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>.
                    They have included in their volume about one sixth of the transcript material.</p>
            <p>The press conferences began in August, 1923, and occurred twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays,
                    throughout Coolidge's years in the White House. This allegedly silent little man from
                    Vermont was the first President to formalize the White House news conference. A dozen <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-061-1-070"/> or so reporters assembled in the west wing of the White House after
                    first submitting written questions to the Presidential secretary. Coolidge then commented on those
                    questions that had passed the screening process. He also made announcements and sometimes with
                    annoyance would permit an oral question. Reporters were under an injunction never to quote the
                    President and to attribute nothing to him directly. Once these rules were made clear,
                    Coolidge's relations with the press were surprisingly cordial. He apparently enjoyed the
                    sessions, and he skillfully made use of his opportunities for publicity.</p>
            <p>One begins this book, and completes it, with a predominant interest in the conferences and in the
                    fact that Coolidge could perpetrate such a political hoax. Possibly for some, the Presidential
                    statements will have no less importance; for Coolidge had much to say on a wide range of topics,
                    domestic and foreign. The press conferences give further evidence that the President was a shrewd
                    politician. There are indications of wider interests and of a greater tolerance and sensitivity, as
                    toward foreign peoples, than this reviewer at least had suspected. At the same time, no comments on
                    prohibition, the Scopes trial, or many matters that aroused excitement in the 1920's are
                    included. The editors take note of Coolidge's limitations (for example, his lack of
                    interest in ideas for their own sake); but they conclude, as readers surely will too, that he had a
                    "surprisingly wide comprehension of public issues."</p>
            <p>One must thank Professors Quint and Ferrell for making this source available and for their superb
                    editorial work. They have broken up the transcript material and arranged it chronologically within
                    topics. Background information and analysis are provided at the beginning of each chapter and in
                    italics throughout the Presidential statements. The editors' comment is often far-ranging
                    and perceptive. With the framework thus provided, the book can almost be thought of as a monograph.
                    In one respect the editors may have done Coolidge a disservice: their own prose is lively if not
                    sparkling–often in contrast to the humdrum remarks of a talkative President.</p>

                    </placeName> University Press, 1964. Pp. ix, 563. Notes, index. $9.75.)</head>
            <p>Professor Mayer hopes to modify the idea that the Republican party "exists nine months every
                    four years to conduct a campaign for the Presidency" (p. ix). He has therefore written a
                    big book, recounting the GOP's first hundred years. He writes in a clear, concise, and
                    often witty style, in a well balanced allotment of space, and with impressive research. His book
                    contains many illuminating anecdotes and analyses and is a brave attempt to synthesize and judge a
                    very difficult subject.</p>
            <p>He begins with a good discussion of why Americans have always loved politics, especially in the
                    nineteenth century, and proceeds election by election through American political history. But
                    despite his impressive research, he produces few fresh facts and no discernible view of the party as
                    a whole. He offers little explanation for its early success and contemporary weakness. His work is
                    generally descriptive and unanalytical <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-061-1-071"/> Mayer is good at
                    characterizing people and poor at analyzing issues. This is an unfortunate division of talents for
                    this particular project, since the GOP usually emphasized issues and party organization rather than
                    men. Mayer does not probe very deeply into the sources of Republican strength after the Civil War
                    and leaves unasked or undeveloped many arresting questions concerning voting habits of minority
                    groups, farmers, and workers who were strongly attached to the party. The book is poorest in dealing
                    with the period from Grant to Theodore Roosevelt, where it seldom rises above doubtful textbook
                    stereotypes. The author leaves the impression that the party succeeded in this long period because
                    it was corrupt and evasive rather than because it appealed to voters on significant issues. Though
                    still a common view, this interpretation of the party has been sharply and effectively challenged in
                    many recent works. The book is best in dealing with the twentieth century, though it only implies
                    answers to the basic political question of those years: what happened to Republican leadership after
                    Theodore Roosevelt, and why did the party's coalition of support vanish?</p>
            <p>Mayer analyzes major and minor figures well. His judgments of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the party's founders are shrewd and stimulating. He is much too
                    charitable, however, toward Theodore Roosevelt, attributing to him many accomplishments belonging
                    rightly to subordinate figures in the Progressive movement. He simply ignores many of
                    Roosevelt's questionable activities and dangerous tendencies. Mayer's discussion
                    of Hoover is well balanced and thoughtful, as are his comments on Alfred M. Landon and the
                    Republican moderates of the 1930's and 1940's. He is much too generous with
                    Eisenhower, who emerges as the pure vanilla he doubtless was, but who also requires some pointed
                    historical assessments in view of the contradictory Republican attitudes he symbolized.</p>
            <p>Since he does not analyze very many major issues or treat much with organizational matters, Mayer has
                    not really written a history of the Republican party but a history of its national campaigns set in
                    a general discussion of the events around them. He undertook a difficult task. To write the history
                    of a major political party is to write the history of a country, and his work ought to be judged
                    first in that light. This book is seldom penetrating and covers only the high spots of Republican
                    history, but it is a useful general introduction to the party's public national history.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Teaching of American History in High Schools</hi> deserves careful consideration by
                    teachers, professors of both history and education, supervisors, librarians, administrators, school
                    boards, and downtown <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-061-1-072"/> quarterbacks. Such consideration should
                    lead many in each group to change their ways.</p>
            <p>From interviews with some two hundred Indiana teachers of American history, questionnaire surveys of
                    all such teachers and their school librarians, and personal experiences and beliefs, the authors
                    report that American history is generally poorly taught. Much fault is laid to teachers who were not
                    intellectual to begin with, took too much education and too little history, and read little or no
                    history outside their formal preparation.</p>
            <p>The authors say frankly that teachers do not practice the tenets that they are supposed to have
                    learned in education classes, but rely chiefly on the textbook and on loose discussion and
                    questioning. The products of such teaching are described as learning little history, lacking ability
                    to read and write, and distracted by extra-curricular activities. Suggested remedies are more
                    lectures bolstered by more quizzes, discipline, and teacher preparation, less discussion, less
                    supervised study, abolition of study halls, more homework, both essay and factual tests, less
                    current events, less audiovisual, and perhaps less television (p. 88) .</p>
            <p>Others share the blame with teachers. Most libraries are woefully inadequate and are often centers
                    for social rather than intellectual activities. Librarians themselves deserve praise, but they get
                    little help from teachers and are overworked, especially at custodial and disciplinary duties.
                    Instruction benefits little from the typical department head, principal, central office
                    administrator, or parent.</p>
            <p>Two suggestions are made for correcting the sorry state of affairs. School boards could do much, but
                    the main solution offered is to "return" the preparation of history teachers and
                    the supervision of high school teaching of history to college and university departments of history.</p>
            <p>The book is far more accurate than the many published caricatures of public education, but it is not
                    a "photograph" as claimed in the Foreword. It is, rather, a painting in which hues
                    and emphases are determined by the artists' feelings and convictions. A photograph would
                    give due space to the admitted proportion of good teachers. It would show the relationship among
                    different kinds of history and between history and the contemporary social sciences. It would show
                    that history textbooks are written largely by historians. Truly supervised study would appear
                    desirable, and reading and writing would not appear as well taught through examination as by
                    instruction. Instruction in American history, poor as it may be by absolute standards, would appear
                    better than that in the other social studies and better than ever before. (The history of education
                    has been neglected by professional historians.) Furthermore, a photograph would show that college
                    and university departments of history generally show little concern for the teaching of history.</p>
            <p>The long paragraph on pages 34 and 35 is true, but it is only half the story. The other half can be
                    shown by paraphrasing it in reverse. In looking at the professor problem, an interesting point
                    appears, namely the lack of concern for teaching on the part of many history professors. Seldom do
                    they think of themselves as members of the teaching "tribe." Most of them look
                    upon themselves as historians <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-061-1-073"/> who happen to teach. They,
                    therefore, associate good teaching, when they think of it at all, with knowledge of history to the
                    exclusion of teaching techniques. Many veteran professors have said that the teaching of history
                    must always remain secondary to their study of history. The reviewer has seen this attitude in
                    conversation with professors eager to talk about their own research, never about methods and
                    materials of teaching. Few of them read any journal about teaching. The number of professors of
                    history who belong to the National Council for the Social Studies is pitifully small. That only a
                    handful of the thousands of professors of history should have felt sufficiently identified with the
                    teaching profession to join this national body is a startling fact. <hi rend="i">Social
                    Education,</hi> the journal of the Council, draws as many blanks when put to history professors as
                    do the names of Erling Hunt, I. James Quillen, or Edgar Wesley. And it goes without saying that most
                    history professors, despite abundant opportunity on their own campuses and in their own classes,
                    never dream of engaging in pedagogical research and writing. The genuine concern of Indiana
                    University professors of history for school teaching is almost unique, but one questions whether so
                    many of <hi rend="i">them</hi> would have shown this concern if the Lilly Endowment had refused

            <p>There are public school people::i Indiana who feel that they have had more than their share of
                    criticism recently without the addition of a new volume of it by Hoosier historians. Indiana
                    schools, however, are fortunate that many professors of history in their state university not only
                    criticize public education, but also seriously try to help improve it. They write textbooks. They
                    participate in programs about public education and, more surprisingly, sometimes attend such
                    programs without participating. They conduct special courses for teachers both on and off the
                    campus. They visit schools, especially classrooms of their students. They serve as school
                    consultants. Three of them, with the help of others and of non-historians including the trustees of
                    the Lilly Endowment, produced the books under consideration here. To the best of this
                    reviewer's knowledge, the schools of no other state are so well served by its own
                    historians.</p>

            <p>This volume is intended as a tribute to a group of historians who made important contributions to
                    southern history in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The author, while born and
                    educated in Indiana, has spent nearly thirty years in the South, teaching at the <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-061-1-074"/> University of <placeName>
                  <country reg="kyu">Kentucky</country>, <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
               </placeName> State University, and Tulane
                    University. In addition to writing several volumes on southern history, Professor Stephenson has
                    served as managing editor of both the <hi rend="i">Journal of Southern History</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Mississippi Valley Historical Review.</hi> The author is obviously qualified to write
                    on the work and significant contributions of these pioneer historians. Ten of the twelve essays
                    which comprise the volume have appeared in print before (from 1946 to 1960) in such reviews as the
                        <hi rend="i">Journal of Southern History,</hi> the <hi rend="i">Mississippi Valley Historical
                        Review,</hi> and several southern state historical quarterlies.</p>
            <p>Nine southern historians are treated in the book: William Garrott <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Herbert B. Adams, William P. Trent, John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bassett, George Petrie, William A. Dunning, Ulrich B. Phillips, Charles W. Ramsdell,
                    and Thomas M. Owen. The men were born between 1850 and 1877 and all but two, Adams and Dunning, were
                    born in the South. The active and productive careers of the group span the years from 1876 to the
                    1940's. The two Yankees, Adams at Johns Hopkins University and Dunning at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, directed dozens of doctoral candidates. Just before and just after 1900
                    these two universities made great contributions to the interest in, and the development of, southern
                    history. Three of the nine men, Trent, Bassett, and Petrie, received their graduate training in the
                    famous "Seminary of History and Politics" under Adams prior to his retirement in
                    1900. A few years later both Phillips and Ramsdell were to come out of the Dunning school at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The remaining two historians fall into no category. William G. Brown, although he had
                    no training in a well-established seminar, was to become an important literary historian and
                    philosophical essayist in the early twentieth century. Thomas M. Owen, without formal training in
                    history, became a pioneer archivist in his native state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, establishing a system of preserving and servicing state records which was to be widely
                    copied in other states. Stephenson concludes his volume with two essays, "Twenty-five Years
                    of Southern Historical Writing" and "A Quarter Century of American Historical
                    Scholarship."</p>
            <p>The several essays are rather uneven in quality. In part this may be a result of the inherent
                    differences among the several historians. The best essays are those on Bassett and Dunning. Some of
                    the most lively writing is found in the Introduction, "The Making of a Book." Here
                    the author in an entertaining fashion touches upon a broad range of subjects. A major fault in the
                    volume lies in the fact that it is composed of several previously written essays each of which was
                    originally intended to have a separate unity. A few readers may become a little weary of reading in
                    essay after essay of the pre-eminence of graduate training at Johns Hopkins in the late nineteenth
                    century. Ten of the twelve essays are documented, but the notes have been collected at the end of
                    the volume for the benefit of the publisher rather than for the convenience of the reader. Even with
                    its faults, this work should prove to be a valuable reference for graduate students and others
                    interested in the history of the South.</p>

            <p>This anthology, the last to be published in the six-volume "American Epochs Series"
                    under the general direction of Frank Freidel, contains selections from the writings of five
                    "philosopher-statesmen"–Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. One might wish for a broader representation of eighteenth-century thinkers, from
                    Jonathan Edwards to Benjamin Rush; but the choice of these particular men reflects clearly Professor
                    Adrienne Koch's view of the American Enlightenment as chiefly oriented toward the theory
                    and practice of government. Unlike their European counterparts these five Americans were not only
                    thinkers but also men of action who played important roles in the revolutionary and constitutional
                    phases of the establishment of the new nation. On the other hand, another "founding
                    father," George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is omitted because he was more a "man of deeds" than an
                    "architect of ideas." Despite some qualms at first about the inclusion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a representative of the Enlightenment, this reviewer agrees that this remarkable
                    cluster of men produced the most influential set of ideas in the period of American history
                    stretching from 1765 to 1815. Yet, by lumping together in this way such diverse and often mutually
                    antagonistic thinkers as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the editor runs some risk of exaggerating the extent of ideological consensus within
                    the American Enlightenment.</p>
            <p>Professor Koch's thirty-page introduction is a model of clear, graceful exposition of the
                    meaning and significance of the American Enlightenment, with well-reasoned arguments for her
                    conception of it. Since it would not fit her purposes, however, she gives little attention to the
                    non-political aspect of American thought in the eighteenth century.</p>
            <p>The writings of each "representative" thinker are divided into three sections, the
                    first containing autobiographical materials intended to reveal something of the individual character
                    of the writer, the second composed of personal correspondence on a variety of
                    subjects–but chiefly political, and the last drawn from books, pamphlets, and other
                    public documents. This method of selection, while making for short, choppy passages in many places,
                    brings the author to life for the reader better than would an anthology restricted to formal
                    political essays. Culling from the vast collected works of American statesmen just now being
                    published in full and definitive, editions, Professor Koch has managed to preserve in her compact
                    selections much of the flavor and breadth of view of the original. For this reason the book should
                    prove useful to undergraduates and others as a means of sampling judiciously the thought of the
                    founding fathers, whose influence upon their country's political traditions has never been
                    matched.</p>

                    Although Professor Miyakawa has used both primary and secondary sources, his account of
                    Protestantism on the American frontier is more a sociological than an historical study. Moreover,
                    his emphasis is principally on the frontier of the Ohio Valley where he finds a substantial amount
                    of conformity and uniformity within the Baptist, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Methodist, and Presbyterian groups. His study suggests that Protestantism was an
                    extremely important influence on early political and economic life as well as on education and
                    religion. Miyakawa's volume is thoughtful, often penetrating; yet its interpretations
                    frequently are either inadequately supported or subject to dissenting conclusions. Some errors of
                    fact were noted as regards particular items.</p>

                    T. Johnson, "This book does not cover La Follette's role as a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator, nor is it a history of the Wisconsin Progressives during this period; rather,
                    it studies Robert M. La Follette, Jr., as a political leader when the Progressive movement founded
                    by his father was in its decline (vii)." In various respects, however, Johnson's
                    volume is even more a study of La Follette's role in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate, 1925-1947, and the history of Wisconsin Progressives during these years than it
                    is of his status as a political leader. Much attention is given to La Follette's <hi rend="i">neglect</hi> of political leadership of Wisconsin Progressives, a role performed by his
                    brother Philip from the death of Robert M. La Follette, Sr., in 1925 until about 1938. Johnson
                    believes that Senator La Follette contributed to his own defeat as a senator as well as to the
                    demise of the Progressive party, which was organized in 1934, by his failure to exercise effective
                    party leadership. This may be true; but given the turmoil and vagaries of Badger State politics,
                    1925-1947, La Follette's remoteness and inactivity as party leader may have been more of an
                    asset than a liability for himself and party. Johnson's study of La Follette reflects
                    considerable research and offers much information, yet it suffers from inadequate editing. As an
                    example of the latter, material included on pages 34-35, 57, 116, and 139 apparently either include
                    quoted material without quotation marks or the paraphrasing of sources used is so meager that
                    certain items read as if they are verbatim quotes.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1867, became one of the best known Muckrakers of the Progressive era of
                    the early twentieth century. This volume reprints his articles on "The Treason of the
                    Senate" which first appeared in the <hi rend="i">Cosmopolitan Magazine</hi> during 1906. It
                    adds the text of a speech by Theodore Roosevelt concerning "The Man with the

                    </placeName> Senator Joseph W. Bailey. (Roosevelt's speech was the one which gave rise to
                    the term Muckraker.) In addition, a thirty-eight page Introduction by George E. Mowry and Judson A.
                    Grenier offers much information about Phillips and the Progressive era, though its usefulness is
                    marred by inadequate documentation. The intemperance and recklessness of Phillips' language
                    combined with his insufficient weighing of evidence now seems startling. Indiana's Charles

                    interests.'" Senator Albert J. Beveridge, however, with whom Phillips had roomed
                    at Asbury (De-Pauw) University, escapes such criticism.</p>

                    $8.50.) Here are the presidential addresses of the Southern Historical Association from
                    its initial annual meeting at Birmingham, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1935, through that at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Asheville</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
               </placeName>, in 1963. They are an
                    extremely useful compilation, especially as their content is often as relevant to basic questions in
                    national history as for questions concerning Southern history. Even a cursory reading of these
                    addresses affords abundant evidence of the great variety of political, economic, and social life
                    within "the South," and, equally significant, the variety of ways in which
                    Southerners as well as Northerners have viewed Southern history.</p>

                    is a condensation of an illustrated discussion concerning houses of <placeName>

                    architecture which were discussed by Peat. This publication, as well as that by Howard E. Wooden on
                    the <hi rend="i">Architectural Heritage of Evans-ville</hi> (reviewed in these pages in the issue
                    for March, 1964), indicates <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-061-1-078"/> the usefulness of local studies in
                    interpreting Indiana's architectural heritage. Wilbur D. Peat's <hi rend="i">Indiana Houses of the Nineteenth Century</hi> (1962) has obviously encouraged local efforts to
                    preserve examples of this heritage.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Joseph Charless: Printer in the Western Country.</hi> By David Kaser. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1963. Pp. 160. Illustrations, appendixes, notes,
                    sources, index. $4.50.) This modest volume, as David Kaser indicates in his Preface, is
                    "a biography of one man and a story of many men." Although it details the life of
                    Irish-born Joseph Charless as a printer and bookseller in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in a general way, it also tells the "story of many men" who served
                    as printers on the frontier of the Middle West. Charless, however, was probably much more involved
                    in the printing and selling of books than were most pioneer editors; and his later career as
                    druggist and hosteler illustrates the versatility of these editors rather that the particular bent
                    of most of them. The problems which beset printers and the importance of their trade in the frontier
                    era are well indicated in this readable volume. A similar book could, and should, be written about
                    Elihu Stout, Father of the Hoosier Press, who in 1804 established the <hi rend="i">Indiana
