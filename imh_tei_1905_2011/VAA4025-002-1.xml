                </byline>
                <p>[This account of the early traders of Indiana was written nearly fifty years ago by Charles B.
                    Lasselle, of <placeName>

                    identified with the <geogName key="tgn_2746502" reg="Wabash River">Wabash</geogName> valley for more
                    than one hundred and twenty-five years, and has himself been a life-long student of the earlier
                    history of the valley and a collector of documents bearing upon the same; hence he speaks as an
                    authority upon this all-but-forgotten early trade.—<hi rend="i">Editor.</hi>]</p>
                <p>OF the early pioneers of our State, there is no class whose history, if known, would be more
                    interesting than that of the old Indian traders. Far in advance of the progress, changes and
                    improvements of civilization, they beheld our country in all the wildness, grandeur and solitude in
                    which the God of nature placed it; and they commingled freely and familiarly with the aboriginal
                    owners who have forever disappeared from its face. In point of time, they were among the first, if
                    not themselves the first, of the explorers of the country, and are known to have visited and traded
                    with the Indians within our borders about a century previous to our Revolutionary War. They have
                    always occupied a prominent position in the early historical events of the country, as a controlling
                    medium in the relations between the whites and Indians. But although—whether French, English or
                    Americans—they have generally been men of education and general intelligence, yet such have been the
                    peculiar nature and vicissitudes of their calling, that they have left us very few records of their
                    experience.</p>
                <p>The earliest traders were French, and came mostly from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013051" reg="Montreal">Montreal</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. From this place they transported their merchandise up the St. Lawrence and across the
                    shores of the Lakes, to their posts in the West, by means of the simple canoe. At first, and before
                    the introduction of horses, the difficulties of passing <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the portage between the head waters <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-002-1-006"/> of the
                    streams running into the Lakes and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007522" reg="Mississippi">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> were surmounted by carrying the canoes and merchandise by means of the men employed in
                    the voyage. The Normandy horse, whose descendents have long been known as the Canadian and Indian
                    ponies, having been introduced into <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7005685" reg="Canada">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, was afterwards, and probably about 1720, brought to the West, and made to serve as
                    pack-horses for all land transportation. And such were the principal modes of transportation in the
                    West, at least in Indiana, from about 1680 to about 1812. The Canadian cart, samples of which are
                    yet to be seen about the old French settlements, had indeed been used about the villages in the
                    early day; but there being no roads of any length, other than the narrow Indian trail, they could
                    not be used for distant transportation.</p>
                <p>We can scarcely realize, at this day, the extent to which the Indian trade was carried on, both in
                    the amount of goods sold, and the furs and the peltries received in exchange. When the country was
                    first visited by the traders, the animals affording these commodities were found in great abundance.
                    The Buffalo ranged in large numbers over the prairies of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and those of our own State bordering on the <geogName key="tgn_2746502"
                        reg="Wabash River">Wabash</geogName>, as well as in the forests in the vicinity of the salt
                    springs. The Beaver, the remains of whose dams are yet to be found in many parts of the State,
                    especially in the northern portion, was to be found in many of the northern streams. The Bear, Elk,
                    Deer, Panther, Otter, Wolf, Wildcat, Fox and Raccoon, were also to be found in considerable numbers
                    in various portions of the State. The Indians not having any weapons with which to take these
                    animals but the simple stone-headed arrow, nor any clothing but the rude elk or deer skin, the
                    introduction of the gun and merchandise by the traders, soon afforded both parties a rich harvest.
                    And although the amount of furs produced was afterwards very much diminished by the destruction of
                    game, yet it still continued large for a long time; and the trade yet yielded the traders large
                    gains so late as about the year 1838, when the principal body of the Pottawattamie tribe of Indians
                    emigrated west of the <geogName type="state" key="tgn_7022231" reg="Mississippi River"
                    >Mississippi</geogName>.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps impossible to state, at this distance of time, who was the first trader within the
                    limits of our State, or when or where he traded. It is quite probable, however, that the northern
                        <pb n="3" id="VAA4025-002-1-007"/> portion was traversed by some of their clerks, called "<hi
                        rend="i">couriers des bois</hi>" (woods rangers,) between the years 1660-70; and it is certain
                    that some of La Salle's men traded in the vicinity of the <geogName key="tgn_2637425"
                        reg="Saint Joseph River">St. Joseph</geogName> of <geogName key="tgn_7020856"
                        reg="Michigan, Lake">Lake Michigan</geogName>, in the year 1680. But the first of whom we have
                    any definite account was the Sieur Juchereau, Lieutenant General of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013051" reg="Montreal">Montreal</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who, we are told, established a trading post "on the <geogName key="tgn_2746502"
                        reg="Wabash River">Wabash</geogName>," in the name of a company, for the collection of buffalo
                    skins. There has indeed been some doubt as to the locality of this spot; but, coinciding with Judge
                    Law in his address to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Historical Society, 1839, for the reasons therein given, together with others, and
                    especially the coincidence of its date of settlement with that of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, as given by its ancient inhabitants,<hi rend="sup">*</hi> the writer deems it
                    conclusive that the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> is the site of this trading post.</p>
                <p>The Sieur Juchereau arrived at this spot, at the head of thirty-four Canadians, on the 28th of
                    October, 1702, for the purpose, as mentioned, of trafficking for buffalo skins, and such was his
                    success in the trade that in a little over two years afterwards there were collected at the post, at
                    one time, upwards of thirteen thousand of those skins.† How many had been collected in the meantime
                    and shipped off, is unknown. The establishment, however, soon met with disasters. Juchereau died;
                    and, although he was succeeded by another, a Mr. Lambert, yet the hostilities of the Indians forced
                    them to abandon it as a trading post, and Lambert with forty men descended to Mobile—then the
                    headquarters of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007256" reg="Louisiana">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>—in the winter of 1705. The above mentioned number of skins having been left at that
                    post, they were neglected by the agents of that company, and were eventually lost.‡</p>
                <p>For a long while after Juchereau's settlement at <placeName>

                    precipitately on La Balme's expedition in the fall of 1780. David Gray, as one of a company, also
                    traded here about the year 1786.</p>
                <p>At W<hi rend="sc">E-AH-TA-NON</hi>, Francis, Peter and Nicholas Berthelet, three brothers, traded
                    from about 1776 to 1780. A Mr. Piett also traded here at an early period, but the precise time is
                    unknown. This place is said to have been a very early trading point, and Captain Croghan, who
                    visited it in 1765, says of it in his journal, that "the great plenty of furs taken in this country,
                    induced the French to establish this post, which was the first on the <geogName key="tgn_2746502"

                    Godfrey (father of the late War Chief of the tribe), who traded from about 1775 to 1791, when the
                    village was destroyed by General Wilkinson.</p>
                <p>Besides those above mentioned there were many other traders at these and other places, and at other
                    periods of time; but perhaps the above meager list is all that can now be furnished of the
                    individuals.</p>

                    1815, it was resumed—generally by new traders—to a much less extent. The old traders, as before
                    remarked, having with great unanimity taken up arms for the protection of the frontiers against the
                    Indians, the survivors had too much lost the confidence of the Indians to make it pleasant or
                    profitable to resume the business.</p>
                <p>At Fort Harrison it was resumed in 1815, mostly with the Delawares, Pottawattamies, Shawnees and
                    Kickapoos, and was continued at that point until about 1820. The principal traders here at that
                    period were Pierre La Plante, Etienne Bisayon,—Wallace, Anthony Lafons,—Gilbert,—Rollon and Michael
                    Brouillet. About this period the Shawnees, Kickapoos and Delawares removed from the limits of the
                    State, except a few of the latter near the eastern boundary, leaving only the Pottawattamies and
                    Miamis, with whom the trade was continued in the northern portion of the State—the former mostly

                <p>According to this invoice, raccoon, deer and mink skins were considerably in excess of any other
                    kind. The deer hair was of little use, the value being in the skin, which was extensively utilized
                    for wearing apparel and other purposes. The raccoon and similar furs were largely made into felt and
                    used for a species of hat which went by the name of beaver.</p>
                <p>How abundantly our forests teemed with fur-bearing animals will be apparent when we reflect that for
                    nearly a century and a half the fur trade, with its insatiable demands, invaded the territory and
                    carried on the process of extermination. During the French occupancy pirogues of the Canadian
                    wood-rangers carried hence untold thousands of bales of skins. After them the Mackinaw Company, the
                    American Fur Company and John Jacob Astor extended their traffic into this region, drawing to <placeName>

                    quantities of beaver, otter and other less valuable peltries. Yet later (in the twenties) the houses

                    </placeName>, and these houses, extending their agencies through the State, assumed considerable
                    proportions. These two brothers are said to have amassed fortunes that aggregated about two million
                    dollars.</p>
                <p>The persistency with which many of the native fauna clung to their once wild haunts long after
                    civilization supplanted the <pb n="15" id="VAA4025-002-1-019"/> wilderness is worthy of note. In

                    badger. The red fox is still hunted.</p>
                <p>The late George W. Pitts, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who during the thirties and forties trapped and hunted extensively along
                        <geogName>White river</geogName>, has stated to the writer that the larger and rarer animals
                    were driven out of <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002633" reg="Marion">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName> and the adjoining territory at a comparatively early date. Wolves, he said, had
                    disappeared by 1835; the latest bear he knew of was seen in 1838; his father shot a catamount about
                    1828. The latter animal was very rare at that date, but wildcats remained until the early forties.
                    Deer were shot as late as 1847; porcupines he remembered seeing in 1835; beavers, once plentiful
                    here, according to him, were extinct by 1830. Beaver at that time led all other pelts in value,
                    being worth from $6 to $10. Otter came next, bringing $2.50 to $3; but a decade or so later otter
                    rose to $10 or $12, by reason of the Russian demand for our best furs.</p>
                <p>An odd and somewhat ludicrous wolf trap was described to the writer by Mr. Pitts. A hollow shell of a
                    tree was selected and a hole large enough to admit a wolf's head cut three or four feet from the
                    ground. From the hole downward a slot was made wide enough for the animal's neck to slip down. By
                    way of bait, blood was smeared about the opening and a piece of meat placed in the hollow of the
                    tree. The wolf, in his efforts to get at the meat, thrust his head in at the hole, and, his neck
                    slipping down the slot, was held as if in a stanchion. The rearing up again with his head in the
                    tree was a difficult if not impossible feat.</p>
                <p>Another trap, much used by the Indians, was made of such materials as the woods afforded, and was at
                    once simple and effective. A number of sticks were driven in the ground to form a semi-circular pen,
                    at the open end of which were placed two forks or crotches, one on either side. A pole was laid on
                    these forks and another on the ground directly beneath, forming a kind of sill across the entrance
                    to the pen. The next feature <pb n="16" id="VAA4025-002-1-020"/> was a heavy pole, or small log, for
                    a deadfall. This was suspended from a piece of grapevine or strip of linden bark, which, passing up
                    over the pole in the forks, was looped over a trigger. This trigger was simply a light stick, which
                    reached down to a third small pole placed against the sides of the forked posts near the ground,
                    which, preventing the weights from pulling the trigger over the top pole, was in turn held in place
                    by the pressure of the trigger. The bait was placed in the pen. The game, venturing in at the
                    entrance, his foot or body pressed down the small pole over which he must step; the trigger was
                    released and the deadfall quickly pinned him to the sill on the ground. These traps would be made of
                    any dimensions, and for all sizes of game, from rabbits to bears.</p>

                    gray) were so plentiful they almost destroyed the young corn. I think it was the spring of '43 that
                    my father's neighbors proposed to kill all the squirrels around his farm if he would furnish the
                    bread for a burgoo. A day was appointed, and corn bread enough for a small army baked by my mother
                    and the neighbor women. Three large iron sugar kettles, filled with water, were hung up near a
                    spring. Beverly Ballard, a Kentuckian, was appointed chief cook. The neighbors, with rifles,
                    approached the farm from every direction, and there was a continuous fusillade until 10 o'clock,
                    when, by agreement, the hunters met, and threw down not less than two hundred squirrels. As they
                    were skinned and washed, they were handed over to the cook for boiling. Then followed a feast. Soup
                    was served in tin cups; squirrels were taken out whole with pointed sticks, and corn pone was served
                    with soup made hot with home-raised pepper.</p>
                <p>"After dinner the targets were set up and there was a test as to the best shot; and many times the
                    center was hit at a distance of twenty, forty and fifty yards."</p>

                    related below, he penetrated to the spot where <placeName>

                    </placeName> now stands and settled there in 1806; was the original surveyor of the town when it was
                    founded, and gave the place its name. It may be added that he was a citizen of the county for sixty
                    years, and occupied various public trusts, being successively justice of the peace, associate judge
                    of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Circuit Court, and clerk of that court. The latter office he held nearly fourteen
                    years. His memoir, not intended for publication originally, was printed in pamphlet form in 1857, by
                    Mr. Isaac H. Julian. Very few of these pamphlets are now in existence and a special interest may
                    attach to the reprinting of the memoir by reason of the centennial anniversary of the settlement of <placeName>

                    <hi rend="b">I</hi> THINK it is Lawrence Sterne who says that—among other things which he
                    mentions—every person should write a book; and as I have not yet done that, I am now going' to write
                    one. As it has always been interesting to me to read biographical sketches, and historical
                    reminiscences of bygone days, I have concluded that some information concerning myself and family,
                    might, perhaps, amuse some of my descendants, at least. The name is pretty extensively scattered
                    throughout this country; such information may therefore be of some interest to them, as it may
                    enable them to trace back their genealogy to the original stock.</p>
                <p>I was born on a small water-course, called Huwaree, a branch of the <geogName key="tgn_1131969"

                    </placeName>, on the 14th day of April, 1781; and am now in the seventy-third year of my age. It is
                    customary, in personal sketches of this kind, to say something of one's parents and education. I can
                    only say, that my parents were always considered very exemplary in all their walk through life. As
                    to education, my opportunities were exceedingly limited; and had it not been for my inclination and
                    perseverance, I should, in all probability, at this day be numbered among those who can scarcely
                    write their names, or perhaps should only be able to make a "X," in placing my signature to a
                    written instrument. In order to show the state of society in my early youth, as an evidence of the
                    intelligence of the <pb n="18" id="VAA4025-002-1-022"/> circle in which I was raised, I can say of a
                    truth, that I never had an opportunity of reading a newspaper, nor did I ever see a bank-note, until
                    after I was a man grown.</p>
                <p>As to my ancestors, I know but little. If my information is correct, my grandfather, Andrew Hoover,
                    left <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7000084" reg="Deutschland">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> when a boy; married Margaret Fouts, in <placeName>

                    </placeName>; and settled on Pipe creek in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. There my father was born; and from thence, now about one hundred years ago, he removed
                    to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007709" reg="North Carolina">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, then a new country. He left eight sons and five daughters, all of whom had large
                    families. Their descendants are mostly scattered through what we call the Western country. Rudolph
                    Waymire, my grandfather on my mother's side, emigrated from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013260" reg="Hanover">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> in <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7000084" reg="Deutschland">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, after he had several children. He used to brag that he was a soldier under His
                    Britannic Majesty, and that he was at the head of the battle of Dettingen in 1743. He left one son
                    and seven daughters by his first wife. Their descendants are also mostly to be found in this
                    country.</p>
                <p>My father had a family of ten children, four sons and six daughters. In order to better our
                    circumstances, he came to the conclusion of moving to a new country, and sold his possessions
                    accordingly. He was then worth rising of two thousand dollars; which at that time, and in that
                    country, was considered very considerably over an average in point of wealth. On the 19th of
                    September, 1802, we loaded our wagon, and wended our way toward that portion of what was then called
                    the Northwestern Territory which constitutes the present State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
                <p>Here permit me to make a passing remark. I was then in the twenty-second year of my age. I had formed
                    an acquaintance and brought myself into notice perhaps rather more extensively than falls to the lot
                    of most country boys. Did language afford terms adequate to describe my sensations on shaking hands
                    with my youthful compeers, and giving them a final farewell, I would gladly do so. Suffice it to
                    say, that those only who have been placed in like circumstances, can appreciate my feelings on that
                    occasion. And although I have lived to be an old man, and experienced the various vicissitudes
                    attendant on a journey through life thus far, I yet look back to that time as the most interesting
                    scene through which I have passed. My mind at this day is carried back to my early associations and
                    school-boy days, <pb n="19" id="VAA4025-002-1-023"/> to my native hills and pine forests; and I can
                    say that there is a kind of indescribable charm in the very name of my natal spot, very different
                    from aught that pertains to any other place on the globe.</p>
                <p>After about five weeks' journeying, we crossed the <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio
                        river</geogName> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then a mere village, composed mostly of log houses. I think it was the day after an
                    election had been held at that place for delegates to the convention to form a Constitution; at any
                    rate a Constitution was formed the following winter, which was amended only within the last few
                    years. After crossing the river, we pushed on to Stillwater, about twelve miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013511" reg="Dayton">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in what is now the county of <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_2000547" reg="Montgomery">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName>. A number of our acquaintances had located themselves there the previous spring. There
                    we encamped in the woods the first winter. The place had proved so unhealthy that we felt
                    discouraged and much dissatisfied, and concluded not to locate there. My father then purchased two
                    hundred acres of land, not far from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2080325" reg="Lebanon">Lebanon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002987" reg="Warren">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName>, as a home, until we could make further examinations. John Smith, afterward one of the
                    proprietors of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014336" reg="Richmond">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, purchased one hundred acres in the same neighborhood, with similar views. Our object
                    was to find a suitable place for making a settlement, and where but few or no entries had been made.
                    But a small portion of the land lying west of the Great Miami, or east of the Little Miami, was
                    settled at that time. We were hard to please. We Carolinians would scarcely look at the best land
                    where spring water was lacking. Among other considerations, we wished to get further south. We
                    examined divers sections of the unsettled parts of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, without finding any location that would please us. John Smith, Robert Hill and myself
                    partially examined the country between the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, before there was a line run in that part of the Territory; and returned much
                    discouraged, as we found nothing inviting in that quarter.</p>
                <p>Thus time passed on until the spring of 1806, when myself and four others, rather accidentally, took
                    a section line some eight or ten miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013511" reg="Dayton">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and traced it a distance of more than thirty miles, through an unbroken forest, to
                    where I am now writing. It was the last of February, or the first of March, when I first saw
                    Whitewater. On my return to my father's, I <pb n="20" id="VAA4025-002-1-024"/> informed him that I
                    thought I had found the country we had been in search of. Spring water, timber, and building rock
                    appeared to be abundant, and the face of the country looked delightful. In about three weeks after
                    this, my father, with several others, accompanied me to this "land of promise." As a military man
                    would say, we made a <hi rend="i">reconnoissance</hi>, but returned rather discouraged, as it
                    appeared at that time too far from home. Were it necessary, I might here state some of our views at
                    that time, which would show up our extreme ignorance of what has since taken place. On returning
                    from this trip, we saw stakes sticking among the beech trees where Eaton now stands, which was among
                    the nearest approaches of the white man to this place. With the exception of George Holman and a few
                    others, who settled some miles south of this, in the spring of 1805, there were but few families
                    within twenty miles of this place.</p>
                <p>It was not until the last of May or the first of June that the first entries were made. John Smith
                    then entered south of Main street, where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014336" reg="Richmond">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands, and several other tracts. My father entered the land upon which I now live,
                    I having selected it on my first trip, and several other quarter sections. About harvest of this
                    same year, Jeremiah Cox reached here from good old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007709" reg="North Carolina">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, and purchased where the north part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014336" reg="Richmond">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands. If I mistake not, it had been previously entered by John Meek, the father
                    of Jesse Meek, and had been transferred to Joseph Woodkirk, of whom J. Cox made the purchase. Said
                    Cox also entered several other tracts. Jeremiah Cox, John Smith, and my father, were then looked
                    upon as rather leaders in the Society of Friends. Their location here had a tendency of drawing
                    others, and soon caused a great rush to Whitewater; and land that I thought would never be settled
                    was rapidly taken up and improved. Had I a little more vanity, I might almost claim the credit (if
                    credit it be) of having been the pioneer of the great body of Friends now to be found in this
                    region; as I think it very doubtful whether three Yearly Meetings would convene in this county, had
                    I not traced the line before mentioned.</p>
                <p>I was now in the twenty-fifth year of my age, and thus far had been rather a wayfaring disciple, not
                    doing much for myself <pb n="21" id="VAA4025-002-1-025"/> or any other person. Having now selected a
                    spot for a home, I thought the time had come to be up and doing. I therefore married a girl named
                    Catharine Yount, near the Great Miami; and on the last day of March, 1807, reached with our little
                    plunder the hill where I am now living. It may not be uninteresting here to name some of the first
                    settlers in the different neighborhoods. On the East Fork were the Flemings, Irelands, Hills,
                    Wassons, Maxwells, etc. At the mouth of Elkhorn were the Hunts, Whiteheads and Endsleys. In this
                    neighborhood were the Smiths, Coxes, Wrights and Hoovers, several of whom commenced operations in
                    the woods in the spring and summer of 1806. This may emphatically be said to have been the day of
                    "log-cabins" and log-rollings; and, although we were in an unbroken forest, without even a blazed
                    pathway from one settlement to another, we yet enjoyed a friendship, and a neighborly interchange of
                    kind offices, which are unknown at this time. Although we had to step on puncheon floors, and eat
                    our corn-bread and venison, or turkey, off of broad pieces of split timber, and drive forks in one
                    corner of our cabins, with cross timbers driven into the walls, for bedsteads, there was no
                    grumbling or complaining of low markets and hard times. The questions of Tariff and National Bank
                    were truly "obsolete ideas" in those days. It was the first week in April before some of us
                    commenced operations in the woods; but we mostly raised corn enough to do us. There was, however, no
                    mill to grind it, and for some weeks we grated all the meal we made use of. About Christmas, Charles
                    Hunt started a mill, on a cheap scale, near the mouth of Elkhorn, which did our grinding until J.
                    Cox established one near to where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014336" reg="Richmond">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands, and which now belongs to Basil Brightwell.</p>
                <p>The Indian boundary was at this time about three miles west of us. The Indians lived on <geogName
                        key="tgn_1131752" reg="White">White river</geogName>, and were frequently among us. They at one
                    time packed off 400 bushels of shelled corn, which they purchased of John Smith. In 1809 a purchase
                    was made, called the "Twelve Mile Purchase,"<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and a goodly number settled on it
                    before it was surveyed; but the war of 1812 coming on, the settlers mostly left their locations, and
                    removed to places of more security. Those who remained built forts and "block houses." The settlers
                    in this neighborhood mostly stood <pb n="22" id="VAA4025-002-1-026"/> their ground, but suffered
                    considerably with fear. George Shugart then lived where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2033080" reg="Newport">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands, some miles from any other inhabitant. In the language of the Friends, he
                    "did not feel clear" in leaving- his home, and he manfully stood his ground unmolested, except by
                    those whom we then styled the "Rangers," from whom he received some abuse for his boldness. The
                    Indians took three scalps out of this county, and stole a number of horses. Candor, however, compels
                    me to say that, as is usually the case, we Christians were the aggressors. After peace was made, in
                    1814, the twelve mile purchase settled very rapidly.</p>
                <p>It will not be amiss, at this stage of our narrative, to state that when we first settled here, the
                    now State of Indiana was called Indiana Territory, and we belonged to <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002324" reg="Dearborn">Dearborn county</region>
                    </placeName>, which embraced all the territory purchased from the Indians at the treaty of

                    </placeName> were afterwards formed out of the northern part of this territory. Although Governor
                    Harrison had the appointing power, he gave the people the privilege of choosing their own officers.
                    An election was accordingly held, when it was found that Peter Fleming, Jeremiah Meek and Aaron
                    Martin were elected Judges, George Hunt, Clerk, and John Turner, Sheriff. County courts were then
                    held by three associate judges, and county business was done before them. One of the first courts
                    held in this county, under the Territorial government, convened under the shade of a tree, on the
                    premises then belonging to Richard Rue, Esq., Judge Park presiding and James Noble prosecutor. In
                    order to show the legal knowledge we backwoodsmen were then in possession of, I will relate the
                    following case. A boy was indicted for stealing a knife, a traverse jury was empaneled, and took
                    their seats upon a log. The indictment was read, and, as usuual, set out that the offender, with <hi
                        rend="i">force and arms</hi>, did feloniously steal, take, and carry away, etc. After hearing
                    the case, the jury retired to another log to make up their verdict. Jeremiah Cox, one of the jurors,
                    and afterwards a member of the convention to frame a Constitution, and of the Legislature, concluded
                    they must find the defendant guilty, but he thought the indictment "was rather too bad for so small
                    an offense." I suppose he <pb n="23" id="VAA4025-002-1-027"/> thought the words "with force and
                    arms" uncalled for, and thought rightly enough, too.</p>
                <p>Some further illustration of our legal knowledge and the spirit of our legislation at this time may
                    be interesting. Although the Friends constituted a large portion of the inhabitants in this quarter,
                    there were in other parts of the county men in whose craniums the military spirit was pretty
                    strongly developed, before the war of 1812 was declared. When that came on, this spirit manifested
                    itself in all its rigor. The Friends were much harassed on account of their refusal to do military
                    duty. Some were drafted, and had their property sacrificed, and at the next call were again drafted,
                    and fined. Four young men were thrown into the county jail during the most inclement cold weather;
                    fire was denied them until they should comply; and had it not been for the humane feeling of David
                    F. Sackett, who handed them hot bricks through the grates, they must have suffered severely. Suits
                    were subsequently brought against the officers for false imprisonment. The trials were had at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031203" reg="Brookville">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002381" reg="Franklin">Franklin county</region>
                    </placeName>. They all recovered damages, but I have every reason to believe that the whole of the
                    damages and costs was paid out of the moneys extorted from others of the Friends. To cap the climax
                    of absurdity and outrage, the gentlemen officers arrested an old man named Jacob Elliott, and tried
                    him by a court-martial, for treason, found him guilty, and sentenced him to be shot! but gave him a
                    chance to run away in the dark, they firing off their guns at the same time. It would fill a
                    considerable volume to give a detailed history of the <hi rend="i">noble patriots</hi> of those
                    days, and of their wisdom and valorous exploits; but this must suffice.</p>
                <p>Connected with this subject, permit me a word respecting my own course. I think it is well known that
                    from first to last I stood by the Friends like a brother (as I would again do under similar
                    circumstances), and used my influence in their favor; yet from some cause, best known to themselves,
                    I have apparently lost the confidence and friendship of a good number of them. The most serious
                    charge which has yet reached me, is that I have not got "the true faith," and not that I have done
                    anything wrong. Of this I do not complain; but must be permitted to say that their course towards me
                    was rather gratuitous. <pb n="24" id="VAA4025-002-1-028"/> I feel confident that they can not in
                    truth say that they have at any time received aught but disinterested friendship from me; and if
                    some of them can reconcile their course toward me with a sense of duty, and of doing by me as I have
                    at all times done by them, I shall therewith be content.</p>
                <p>In 1816 we elected delegates to the convention which formed our late Constitution, and named the
                    State Indiana. On the third day of February following, I was elected Clerk of Wayne Circuit Court,
                    and by favor of the voters of the county, held the office nearly fourteen years. I was prevented
                    from serving out my full constitutional term of office, by a deceptive ruling of the Court, which I
                    have no fears will ever be hunted up as a precedent in a similar or any other case.</p>
                <p>I was almost the first man who set foot in this part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1003004" reg="Wayne">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName>, and have been an actor in it for more than forty years. It may not be out of place
                    here for me to say, that I feel conscious I often erred through ignorance, and perhaps through
                    wilfulness. Yet (and with gratitude be it spoken), it has fallen to the lot of few men to retain so
                    long the standing which I think I still have among all classes of my fellow citizens. I believe it
                    is a privilege conceded to old men to boast of what they have been, and what they have done. I shall
                    therefore take the liberty of saying, that I have now seven commissions by me, for offices which I
                    have held, besides having had a seat in the Senate of this State for six years.</p>
                <p>I will add, that in the employ and under the direction of John Smith and Jeremiah Cox, I laid off the
                    city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014336" reg="Richmond">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, did all their clerking, wrote their deeds, etc. If I recollect rightly, it was first
                    named Smithville, after one of the properietors; but that name did not give general satisfaction.
                    Thomas Robbards, James Pegg, and myself, were then chosen to select a name for the place. Robbards
                    proposed Waterford, Pegg,Plainfield, and I made choice of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014336" reg="Richmond">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which latter name received the preference of the lot-holders.</p>
                <p>I have some fears that the preceding remarks may be looked upon as betraying the vanity of an old
                    man; but I wish it distinctly understood, that I ascribe the little favors which I have received,
                    more to surrounding circumstances, and the partiality of my friends, than to any qualification or
                    merits in myself.</p>
                <pb n="25" id="VAA4025-002-1-029"/>
                <p>There are several other subjects connected with the early history of <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1003004" reg="Wayne">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName>, on which I could dwell at some length. I could refer to the first dominant party,
                    their arbitrary proceeding in fixing the county seat at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salisbury</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the seven years' war and contention which followed, ending with the final location of
                    the shiretown at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031339" reg="Centerville">Centreville</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> But as the rival parties in that contest have mostly left the
                    stage, and the subject is almost forgotten, I think it unnecessary to disturb it.</p>
                <p>A lengthy chapter might be written on the improvements which have been made within the last fifty
                    years in <placeName>

                    </placeName> (to say nothing of the rest of the world), in the arts and sciences generally, but as I
                    do not feel myself competent to the task, I shall not attempt it.</p>
                <p>And now, in bringing this crude and undigested account of my experience to a close, short as it is,
                    it gives rise to many serious reflections. When I look back upon the number of those who set out in
                    life with me, full of hope, and who have fallen by the way, and gone to that bourne from whence
                    there is no returning, with not even a rude stone to mark the spot where their mortal remains are
                    deposited, language fails me, and indeed there is no language adequate to the expression of my
                    feelings. I shall therefore drop the subject, leaving the reader to fill up the blank in his own
                    way.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, let me say a word about my politics and religion. In politics, I profess to belong to
                    the Jeffersonian school. I view Thomas Jefferson as decidedly the greatest statesman that America
                    has yet produced. He was the chief apostle of both Political and Religious Liberty. My motto is
                    taken from his first Inaugural: "Equal and exact justice to all men" — and I will add—without
                    calling in question their political or religious faith, country, or color.</p>
                <p>And here I wish it distinctly understood, and remembered, that I stood almost alone in this section
                    of the State, in opposition to our ruinous system of internal improvements, concocted and brought
                    about at the sessions of the Legislature in the years 1835 to 1836; which resulted in the creation
                    of a State debt which the present generation will not see paid; and which has verified the text in
                    the old Book to the very letter, which says that the iniquities of the fathers are visited upon
                    their children to the third and fourth generations.</p>
                <pb n="26" id="VAA4025-002-1-030"/>
                <p>As to religion: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Happy is he, the only happy man, Who, from <hi rend="i">choice</hi>, does all the good he

                    </quote>
                </p>
                <p>"The world is my country, and my religion is to do right." I am a firm believer in the Christian
                    religion, though not as lived up to by most of its professors of the present day. In the language of
                    Jefferson, I look upon the "Christian philosophy as the most sublime and benevolent, but most
                    perverted system that ever shone on man." I have no use for the priesthood, nor can I abide the
                    shackles of sectarian dogmas. I see no necessity for confessions of faith, creeds, forms and
                    ceremonies. In the most comprehensive sense of the word, I am opposed to all wars, and to slavery;
                    and trust the time is not far distant when they will be numbered among the things that were, and
                    viewed as we now look back upon some of the doings of what we are pleased to style the dark ages.</p>

                                <p>The Memorial of the Society of Friends of the said Territory respectfully represents:</p>
                                <p>That few if any of the present members of the Legislature, we presume, are altogether
                                    unacquainted with the conscientious scruples of Friends against bearing arms, or
                                    acting in any manner as military men, ever since they became a religious society.
                                    And considering the penalties and sufferings they have heretofore been subject to on
                                    that account, there is no room left to suppose that their declining to act in that
                                    capacity proceeded from obstinacy, or a disregard to the laws of their country. They
                                    conceive that, notwithstanding they have always declined the use of the sword, they
                                    have not been useless citizens; and that the indulgence which has been granted to
                                    conscientious people in other governments, has not in any manner been prejudicial to
                                    the real interest of those countries, but rather that it has been a means of
                                    inducing useful citizens to settle and improve various parts thereof. Nor does it
                                    admit of a doubt, that penal laws, designed to force people to act in violation of
                                    what they believe to be their duty to their Maker, never did and never will promote
                                    the true interest and safety of any country. And although heavy fines have
                                    heretofore in some cases been impressed for non-attendance of musters, and often
                                    doubled by unreasonable seizures, to the great distress of some poor families; yet
                                    it seems hardly probable that the public have been much, if at all, benefited by
                                    these extortions. Your memorialists, therefore, can not suppose that it can be a
                                    desirable object with a free and enlightened people, to subject any denomination of
                                    Christians to penalties and sufferings, either in their persons or property, on
                                    account of their religious opinions, which can never be injurious to the country at
                                    large, or to any individual. All of which we submit to the Legislature, that they
                                    may make such amendment of the present militia laws as to them may seem reasonable
                                    and just.</p>

                <p>PRESIDENT, David Hoover; vice-presidents, Smith Hunt and L John Peele. After prayer, some
                    interesting-portions of the proceeding's of the first Board of Commissioners of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, dating as far back as 1817, were read, which were illustrated by relations of divers
                    incidents of those early days by Messrs. Rariden, Test, Newman, and others.</p>
                <p>John Beard, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032896" reg="Milton">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was then called on for his "experience." He gave an account of his removal to this
                    region, and the gratification he felt in exchanging the red soil, full of flint stones, of his
                    native Carolina, for the black and fertile lands of Indiana. In the vigor of youth, he regarded not
                    the Herculean labors and hardships which then rose before him, for, to use his own words, he "felt
                    that he had a fortune in his own bones." He declared that, although looking back from the present
                    time the lives of the pioneers might appear by no means enviable, yet they did not so seem to these
                    who experienced them. Mr. Beard added, among other interesting facts, that a little daughter of his
                    own was the first white person who died in the present limits of <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1003004" reg="Wayne">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName> (in 1807); and that the first settlers had to go either to <placeName>

                    </placeName> or <placeName>

                    </placeName> to mill.</p>
                <p>Mr. Beard was followed in similar details of experience by Smith Hunt, Henry and Frederick Hoover,
                    John Peele, Jeremiah L. Meek, and others.</p>
                <p>Perhaps both the oldest man and the oldest settler present was Hugh Cull.</p>
                <p>The next meeting is appointed for the last Sunday in September, 1856, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031339" reg="Centerville">Centreville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The idea of such meetings is highly laudable, and we trust that hereafter, due efforts
                    will be made to enlist the interest and presence of as many of the early settlers as possible, so as
                    the more effectually to further the objects proposed by these social reunions of the rapidly
                    diminishing remnant of the men and women to whom the present generation are so much indebted.</p>

                    </placeName>. These papers, some twenty-five in number, were printed at intervals from March to
                    September, making, in the aggregate, an amount of matter wholly beyond the limits of the space to be
                    spared in this magazine. Much of this matter was second-hand, and a repetition of facts that had
                    already been published in the city histories. On the other hand, not a little of it was based upon
                    two documents of antiquarian value, which are to the present day kept in private possession as
                    being, in the main, of family interest only. These are the journals of Mr. Calvin Fletcher, the
                    elder, and his wife, which record happenings in the new capital at a very early day. These journals,
                    where quoted directly or where drawn upon, afford glimpses of life, society, conditions and events
                    that are wholly fresh and a distinct contribution to the source material of <placeName>

                    the series, making free with the text in the matter of abridgement. The student who may wish to make
                    use of the full text, may do so by aid of the references given. The full series may be found in

                <p>IN perusing, recently, a brief diary kept by my mother (who died in 1854) I found several interesting
                    religious facts and data in connection with the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>

                <p>My father was married to Sarah Hill, in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, May 1, 1821. He made a preliminary visit to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in August of that year. On September 19, accompanied by my mother, he began his second
                    journey to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, arriving here in nine days. On the first day of October he rented a log cabin on block
                    70, lot No. 2. In my father's journal, date of Dec. 31, 1821, I find this entry: </p>
                <pb n="30" id="VAA4025-002-1-034"/>
                <p>"I am now situated on block 70, lot No. 2, in a little cabin, 16 x 17 feet, belonging to a Mr. Cap,

                <p>It was here that my mother began the brief diary referred to. The persons most frequently mentioned
                    in the diary are Mr. James Blake, Mr. and Mrs. Paxton, Dr. Coe, Mr. and Mrs. Nowland, Mrs. Bates,
                    the Hawkins's, B. F. Morris, Dr. Dunlap, the Bradleys, the Yandes's, and Judge and Mrs. Wick.</p>

                                <p>"Sunday, Nov. 18, 1821. I attended prayer-meeting at Mr. Stevens'.</p>
                                <p>"Sunday, Nov. 25. I attended preaching at Mr. Hawkins', where I heard a very good
                                    sermon by a Newlight minister. The text was: ‘See that ye walk circumspectly, not as
                                    fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.’</p>
                                <p>"Sunday, Dec. 30. I heard a sermon delivered by a Newlight minister which I did not
                                    think commendable, but we must allow for it, as it has not been but about three
                                    months since he began to speak in public.</p>
                                <p>"Sunday, May 12, 1822. I attended preaching in the Governor's Circle. It was the
                                    first sermon ever delivered at that place. Rev. Mr. Proctor took his text from the
                                    30th chapter of Proverbs, and 17th verse: ‘Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and
                                    all her paths are peace.’ In the afternoon he delivered another sermon from Luke
                                    XV:7: ‘I say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner who
                                    repenteth.’ The preacher is a Presbyterian and a very good orator.</p>
                                <p>"Tuesday, 14th. In the morning it rained and in the afternoon it was clear but muddy.
                                    Mr. Fletcher attended preaching at the schoolhouse. The sermon was delivered by Mr.
                                    Proctor, who took for his text Ps. 42, 1st verse: ‘As the hart panteth after the
                                    water brook, so panteth my soul after thee, O God!’</p>
                                <p>"Monday, the 20th of May. Rainy and disagreeable. Rev. Mr. Proctor, Dr. Coe, Mr.
                                    Linton, Mr. Fletcher and myself all dined at Mr. Nowland's.</p>
                                <p>"Tuesday, 21st. I rode (horseback) out in the country about two miles to Mr. Burton's
                                    with Mr. Paxton and Mrs. Nowland.</p>

                                    from another. This day Mr. Rice, a Presbyterian preacher, and Dr. Coe dined with Mr.

                <p>"Monday, November 11, ('22). About two o'clock p. m. Mr. Nowland departed this life, and, it was
                    said, very happily. He said he ‘had made his peace with God, and was willing to go.’</p>
                <p>"Tuesday, November 12. Rev. Mr. Proctor delivered a very pathetic sermon on the occasion [of Mr.

                    were crowded. In her journal Mrs. Calvin Fletcher wrote:</p>

                    day that was overcast and gloomy. The wind was high, and while the auctioneer was urging the bidding
                    a limb was wrenched from its place in the trees overhead, and one of the bystanders came near being
                    killed. The sales continued for a week, and no less than 313 lots were disposed of. The total which

                    only 20 per cent., the remaining four-fifths to be paid in four annual instalments. The average
                    price of lots was about $113. The highest priced one was that on the northwest corner of Washington
                    and <placeName>

                    that the court house was to be built on the opposite square and it would be valuable as a tavern or
                    dram shop site.<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>

                <p>In his journal, date of October 1, 1821, my father says: "I found the place very sickly," but it
                    appears that after the week of the sale everything put on a better face. My mother speaks of the
                    beauty of the Indian summer. Much of the bright foliage, however, was not to be stripped by the
                    blasts, for the woods were resounding with the stroke of the ax and the crash of falling trees.</p>
                <p>The favorite ax of those days was the "Collins ax," manufactured at <placeName>

                <p>Cabins arose as if by magic, and one man, Colonel Paxton, had the audacity to begin a frame house on
                    the south side of Washington street (near <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>). This building, before it was finished, was sold to Mr. James Blake. My father and
                    mother were to be the first occupants, and here my brothers, Elijah and Miles, and myself were born.
                    The main body of this magnificent residence was one story high, and consisted of two rooms, neither
                    of which could have been more than fifteen feet square, connected by a covered space with a kitchen.
                    My mother in her journal speaks of moving from their smoky cabin to this frame house in May, 1822,
                    while my father has left in his diary a copy of the agreement by which he rented the house from Mr.
                    Blake. As it illustrates the prices of board and rent at that day I copy the contract. It sets forth
                    that:</p>
                <p>"The said Blake convenants and agrees to give to the said Fletcher possession of the frame house
                    standing on block 67, lot 12, as soon as it shall be fixed convenient for a family to dwell therein,
                    together with the said lot, which the said Fletcher is to have and enjoy for the term of one year
                    from and after the time he takes possession. In consideration of the above premises he, the said
                    Fletcher, is to board the said Blake during the year, <hi rend="sup">∗ ∗ ∗</hi> and the said Blake
                    is to give the said Fletcher ten bushels of corn as a further consideration of board; and the said
                    Blake is to have the privilege of the east room of said house in common with said Fletcher, together
                    with the stable and said lot."</p>
                <p>Colonel Blake was the first in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to have a non-professional collection of miscellaneous works that might be called a
                    library. My father and Mr. Merrill were next in the list with literary works, Mr. Merrill's
                    collection being the larger. Goldsmith's "Animated Nature" and the "Arabian Nights' Entertainments"
                    were the first books, except the Bible, read to me by my mother, that made an impression upon me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>In October, 1821, there were three weeks of beautiful weather, and my mother says in her journal,
                    under the date of October 27:</p>
                <pb n="34" id="VAA4025-002-1-038"/>
                <p>"This day is very pleasant and rather smoky. It appears like Indian summer. We have had very little
                    rain in this place for about three weeks. This has made it very favorable for those who have moved
                    in and are building."</p>
                <p>Under such circumstances <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> may be said to have begun her existence. The sale of more than three hundred lots, but
                    few of which were purchased on speculation, brought hither those who were to be permanent settlers.
                    There seemed to be a most kindly disposition on the part of the people toward each other. Visits
                    were the order of the day and mutual aid was never withheld. There was not a capitalist in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>—but few were even with the world—and there was not a man or woman, however exalted
                    their social position in the land whence they came, but put his or her hand to work in the frontier
                    life of the New Purchase. In her journal I find my mother writing on the 1st day of November, as
                    follows.</p>
                <p>"This day I was spinning wool at Mr. McIlvain's."</p>
                <p>This Mr. McIlvain was the earliest justice of the peace in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was an upright, Christian man, who had been associate justice in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and was afterward elected one of the associate judges for <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002633" reg="Marion">Marion county</region>
                    </placeName>. His log cabin stood not far from the present site of the Second Presbyterian Church.
                    One of my earliest recollections is that of a visit to Judge McIlvain's. He cultivated the ground
                    that is around the church, and produced the usual crop of corn and potatoes. He also was the first
                    to raise poultry on an extended scale. There was one crop that was unusual, and which, I presume, he
                    was the first and the last to raise in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. My father informed me that when he first came here, in the summer of 1821, he found
                    Judge James McIlvain living at the place I have indicated, and that, amongst other things he had
                    planted, was quite a large patch of cotton. This cotton came to maturity in the autumu, and served
                    the purpose, when spun, of candle wicking.</p>
                <p>I spoke of the alacrity with which new Indianapolitans aided each other and turned their hands to
                    everything. I give a few instances, quoting from my mother's journal:</p>
                <p>"November 5, 1821. Mr. Fletcher has been helping Mr. Blake husk corn." Again: "Friday, December 7. We
                    killed a beef. Mr. Paxton and Mr. Blake helped to butcher it." Again, under the date of November 24:
                    "Mrs. Nowland was making a <pb n="35" id="VAA4025-002-1-039"/> bonnet. She came to me to know
                    whether I could make it. I did not understand it, but gave her all the instruction I possibly
                    could." Other entries are: "I was very much engaged in trying out my tallow;" "To-day I dipped
                    candles;" "To-day I finished the ‘Vicar of Wakefield’;" and, "I commenced to read the Life of
                    Washington." There was also an inkling of a singing-school in "I borrowed of Mr. Blake a singing
                    book." There are afterwards notices of the singing-school, where all that could sing joined for
                    mutual improvement. One of the leading singers was Henry Bradley, who was one of the early pillars
                    of the Baptist church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
                <p>The reference in this journal to dinner parties, teas, quiltings, etc., are exceedingly numerous.
                    Good feeling pervaded the whole communit. While there was genuine western hospitality, there were
                    some other motives at the bottom for such constant courtesy on the part of many of the new-comers
                    toward the rank and file. There was to be an election of county officers in the spring and hence the
                    endeavor on the side of certain gentlemen to win over by politeness and attention every voter and
                    his wife.</p>
                <p>The first mention of any musical instrument in the journal is in an entry of December 27, 1821:</p>
                <p>"I was sitting by the fire and Mr. Fletcher was reading Robertson's history of America when the news
                    came that Mr. Blake had returned from Corydon. Mr. F. has gone to see him, and when I write a few
                    more lines I will go also, although I feel very much fatigued, for it is a long time since I have
                    heard the fiddle played. I think it will seem very melodious, and I am just about to start to hear
                    it."</p>
                <p>But while there were plenty of calls, visits, etc., the great social events of the winter were the
                    Christmas and New Year's parties. The former was a "stag" party, and the latter was a ball. My
                    father's journal is more full in regard to Christmas, 1821:</p>
                <p>"This day I got up at sunrise. I visited several of my neighbors, who all appeared friendly. About
                    ten o'clock I went to the river" [on the banks of which there were then more cabins than elsewhere].
                    "I found at Mr. McGeorge's a large collection of men, principally the candidates for the new county
                    offices. The <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-002-1-040"/> county is just being laid off. McGeorge had the
                    only barrel of cider in town. I suppose it to have cost him about seven dollars. In the liberality
                    of the candidates the barrel was unheaded, and all promiscuously drank. But as the cider was frozen,
                    the dog-irons were put red-hot into the barrel. After having drank heartily of the cider they took
                    brandy, which soon produced intoxication. A friend of mine, having in some way made a mistake as to
                    its inebriating qualities, took too much. I therefore left the company and came home with him. I
                    found a great degree of accommodation and courtesy used among all classes. The candidates led the
                    concourse from one place to another till sundown."</p>
                <p>The ladies on that Christmas appeared to have had a very unostentatious time of it, for they spent
                    the day in much quiet visiting.</p>
                <p>"Tuesday, Christmas," writes my mother, "Mrs. Bradley and Mrs. Paxton came and spent the day with me.
                    They dined with me. Then Mrs. B. and I went to Mrs. Paxton's, where we both took tea. After
                    remaining a while I returned home, and then went to the Nowland's. I then came home again and read a
                    chapter in the Bible, etc."</p>
                <p>The crowning social occasion of the season was a New Year's party given at Mr. Wyant's cabin, of
                    which occasion Colonel Blake was the master, as he was of most public assemblies. I have now before
                    me the invitation to that first party of a ceremonious kind ever given in the New Purchase. This is
                    the first invitation of a formal nature ever penned here. There was no printing press at that time
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and there was evidently but very little writing paper. The paper is four by two and
                    three-quarter inches, and the invitation, written in a clear hand, reads:</p>
                <p>"The company of Mr. and Mrs. Fletcher is requested to a party at J. Wyant's, Tuesday, the first day
                    of January, 1822, at 3 o'clock p. m.</p>

                <p>We can see how democratic were the hours in those primitive days. This party or ball began at three
                    p. m. and concluded at midnight.</p>

                <p>The legal instruments and forms were pretty nearly as crude as those used in private business. The
                    official reports of the county officers were written on ordinary sheets of writing paper,
                    distinguished only by a faint, half-legible seal, and the tax receipts were on ragged scraps of
                    sheets, printed, when printed at all, in a style that would, at the present day, excite the derision
                    of an apprentice in a country office. A manuscript tax notice written by Jeremiah Johnson when he
                    was collector for <placeName>

                    </placeName>. My father and Mr. Burke pushed the boat up-stream.</p>
                <p>There were eighteen houses here at that time, all cabins. They were built along the bank of <geogName

                    landing to a point near where the Vandalia railroad bridge is situated. Among these eighteen famlies
                    I remember John and Michael and David Van Blaricum, Daniel Yandes, Dr. Isaac Coe, John McCormick,
                    Isaac Wilson, a Mr. Concord, Bethuel Dunning, the ferryman, Obadiah Harris, a Mr. Frazier, Jeremiah
                    Collins and a Mr. Keeler.</p>
                <p>The <geogName key="tgn_1131742" reg="White">White river</geogName> bridge was built in 1832 and 1833.
                    The fine poplar timbers of this bridge where whip-sawed on the bank <pb n="40"
                        id="VAA4025-002-1-044"/> where the bridge was to be, on a frame, reaching out from the bank
                    there. The timber was got up the river eight miles and hewed about square, from a foot to three feet
                    square, in the woods, and I rafted it down to the place where it was whipsawed into proper shapes.</p>
                <p>I saw the Delaware and Miami tribes of Indians pass through, going West. They camped by the river,
                    and in the morning all of them went in swimming. They said they never swam in the evening or at
                    night. There was a large tribe of them, over a thousand, I think, all friendly.</p>
                <p>Camp meetings were held by the Methodists every year. The first one was south of town, on the
                    Three-notch Line (now South Meridian street). It was on Kelly's farm, and a great crowd attended.
                    The Methodist preachers were great enthusiasts, men of power, eloquence and earnestness. They did
                    important work in bringing the people to the support of good government, morality and religion.
                    Among the great men who preached there were John Strange, Edwin Ray, James Havens, Edwin Ames and
                    James Armstrong. The next camp meetings were held for years on the Military Park ground, near the
                    canal. Afterward the meeting was on the land occupied by the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, and next it was
                    in the grove on the land at the then north end of Illinois street, at old First street.</p>

                    to Big Eagle creek, west of town, was macadamized. The broken stone was put on in strata of three
                    inches at a time, three times, nine inches in all. Each layer was settled by use for a time, and
                    then the next was put on. After this little patch of macadam stone was put on, Jackson and Van Buren
                    vetoed all the National road bills, so it was a very bad road till the State gave it to a plank-road
                    company, and the people soon rode on a plank floor, which was good till it rotted or wore out.</p>

                    so much new matter to one familiar with Boone. The articles, largely anecdotal and revealing an
                    intimate knowledge of pioneer life and early happenings, give a graphic view of conditions not to be
                    gleaned from a more formal work based wholly upon scholarship. They have a value all their own, and
                    should be of interest to all educators. The series contains too much matter to be reprinted entire

                <p>THERE is a class which entertains the belief that the early settlers of Indiana were not as well
                    educated as were the early settlers of her sister States. I think this belief was quite generally
                    entertained a half century ago, and, perhaps, even later by the people of these sister States. I do
                    not know why this belief should be held by any one to-day. I know of no reason why the Indiana
                    pioneers should not be considered as the equals in every respect of the pioneer settlers of any of
                    the other States at that period.</p>

                <p>It is stated by Gilmore, in "The Advance Guard of Western Civilization," that of the 256 settlers who

                    signed by his mark. Mr. Roosevelt, in writing "The Winning of the West," had occasion to examine a
                    great many documents written and signed by the pioneer Tennesseeans and Kentuckians, and he gives
                    testimony as following:</p>
                <p>"In examining original drafts of petitions and the like, signed by the hundreds of original settlers
                    of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, I have been struck by the small proportion—not much over three or four per cent, at
                    the outside—of men who made their mark instead of signing."</p>
                <p>I have no doubt that the same fact would appear from an examination on as large a scale of original
                    documents signed by the Indiana pioneers. I have done a little of that kind of work myself and have
                    found the same result that Mr. Roosevelt did.</p>
                <p>Of course, all the schools of the pioneering period were inferior to the schools of to-day. In
                    methods and appliances the schools of the two periods were as wide asunder as the poles, but in
                    results, take it school for school and month for month, I am inclined to think the difference was
                    not so very marked. Dr. Boone, in his "History of Education in Indiana,"<hi rend="sup">*</hi> does
                    not, as I remember, discuss this question, but if he did he would hardly agree with me.
                    Nevertheless, the evidence is abundant that the pioneer schoolmasters were, in general, fairly
                    efficient workers in the schoolroom.</p>
                <p>However much or little of school training the Indiana pioneers had, of two facts, I think, we may be
                    assured: 1. They differed, as a class, in no respect as to their education, from the pioneer
                    settlers of any other State of that period. 2. The sentiment quite generally prevailed among them,
                    as it did with the people of all other States, of an earnest desire that their children should enjoy
                    far more excellent educational privileges than <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> people of their day, the American idea of the great value of school training. Of the
                    truth of these two propositions I think there can be no doubt. Dr. Boone, in his history, makes it
                    quite plain that later on in Indiana there came a time when there was a seeming indifference in
                    educational affairs that was not at all creditable to the people of the State, but that charge can
                    not in justice be laid to the door of the first comers. The truth is, that long before any steps had
                    been taken in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, or anywhere else in the western world, looking to a free-school system to be supported
                    by the State, Indiana, in her organic law, had made provision for a system of free education,
                    commencing in the township schools and ending in the State University, and but for the great poverty
                    of the people, which rendered the scheme absolutely impracticable, there can be no doubt that there
                    would have been a free-school system in active operation in this State twenty years or more before
                    the first blundering steps were taken toward it in any other State.</p>
                <p>If one would take the time for it he might secure quite a varied and extensive assortment of "first
                    schools" in the State. Mr. Randall Yarbro, who came to <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002273" reg="Clark">Clark county</region>
                    </placeName> in 1810, said: "What was probably the first school in Indiana was opened in 1811 in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, near the river bank." From a work entitled "Indiana Methodism" I quote: "The first
                    school of any kind in the territory of Indiana was taught one and a half miles south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031350" reg="Charlestown">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1803." In the summer of 1796 Volney visited <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and declared that nobody ever opened a school among the French there till it was done
                    by the Abbe R. [Rivet], a missionary banished hither by the French Revolution; and he adds the
                    further statement that "out of nine of the French scarcely six could read or write, whereas
                    nine-tenths of the American emigrants from the east could do both." From the testimony of John
                    Tipton, a capital-site commissioner, we are warranted in believing that a Frenchman taught school in
                    an Indian village, situated on what is now the northwest corner of <placeName>

                <p>The first school within the present borders of the State was a French school, probably at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and the first Anglo-American school was taught in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, whose settlement was begun not later than 1785, and probably two or three years before
                    that. At any rate, the place was a "small town" in 1789, and although it was never a place of more
                    than a few log houses, we might safely assume that schools of some sort were provided for the
                    children of the settlement, for this would accord with what I believe to have been the unvarying
                    American practice. After the peace of Greenville, in 1795, the Clark's Grant settlement naturally
                    grew faster than it did before, and in 1800 its population numbered 929. Surely there must have been
                    schools maintained by this time. But we are not left to conjecture merely. From the old records of <placeName>

                    schoolmasters almost from the very first.</p>
                <p>The presumption is next to conclusive that a school was opened in <placeName>

                    </placeName> prior to 1802. In the spring of 1796 sixteen families moved across the Big Miami and
                    became the first settlers of <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002324" reg="Dearborn">Dearborn county</region>

                    organized a school and brought in the first schoolmaster known to that part of the country, one
                    Isaac Polk, who "was known far and near as Master Polk." What these sixteen families who moved on
                    southeastern Indiana soil in the spring of 1796, and who were joined by four or five of the families

                    unfortunately, has not seen fit to say. We are left to conjecture, but with the record made during

                <p>Without further discussion, we may accept that in general, whenever and wherever a neighborhood
                    contained enough children to warrant the enterprise, a schoolmaster was secured and a school was
                    opened. But it must be remembered that neighborhoods <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-002-1-049"/> in the

                    Daily's school path, like thousands of others, was not very plain, and was sometimes crossed by wild
                    and savage beasts. His devoted mother, realizing the dangers that beset her boy, went with him part
                    of the way every morning, carrying her youngest born in her arms, and every evening she met him on
                    the way as he returned to his home. One of the first schools taught in <placeName>

                    miles to attend their schools.</p>
                <p>In the beginning, houses were not built exclusively for school uses, if an unoccupied cabin or other
                    place was found available for the purpose. The first school taught in <placeName>

                    Conway. Barns were not infrequently turned into summer schoolhouses during the pioneer educational
                    period. The first school taught in Newburg, <placeName>

                    the exception and not the rule. The rule was that if a house of some kind was not found ready-made
                    when the time for organizing a school came around, those expecting to be its patrons usually made
                    short work of building one. The first were the plainest and cheapest form of log cabin. The
                    neighbors of the Stotts settlement on <geogName key="tgn_1131742" reg="White">White
                    river</geogName>, in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, began and finished ready for occupancy their schoolhouse in one day. Of course, it was
                    the rudest of log cabins, but it may well be supposed that there were hundreds of not much if any
                    better in Indiana from first to last. I have been told of one such that was built and occupied in
                    White River township, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002508" reg="Jackson">Jackson county</region>
                    </placeName>, at a very early day. It was a pole cabin without window, floor or chimney. The fire
                    was kindled on a raised clay platform or hearth in the center, and the sparks and smoke escaped
                    through a large opening in the roof. The children sat on benches next the walls, facing the center,
                    and studied their lessons by the light that came whence the smoke escaped. The house was modeled,
                    evidently, after a hunters' camp. In another part of the same county, a first temple of learning was
                    erected and finished without windows or openings for the light to come in save at the door and the
                    wide throat of the enormous chimney. A similar one was a schoolhouse in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, this State. We usually associate with the primitive schoolhouses the "greased paper
                    windows," but the truth is, "paper glass" marked a step in the process of the evolution of these
                    structures. In the history of <placeName>

                    </placeName> the statement is made that the first schoolhouses had uncovered openings through which
                    the light entered. There were first schoolhouses elsewhere in the State that were without windows.

                    improvement and mark an era in the improvement of schoolhouse architecture. The settlement of <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_2000555" reg="Spencer">Spencer county</region>
                    </placeName> was begun as early as about 1812, and the statement may well be true, for its
                    earliest-built schoolhouse belonged to the first of the Territory. In Blue River township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002447" reg="Hancock">Hancock county</region>
                    </placeName>, the first one was built of logs and had five corners. It was not chinked and daubed,
                    had no windows, and but one door. This must have been as late as 1830. The uncovered openings of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> houses are suggestive of the portholes in the blockhouses built during the early days
                    as a protection against the Indians. It is a well-known fact that after the final cessation of
                    Indian hostilities the old forts were in some instances converted into schoolhouses, and I find it
                    recorded that a school was taught in 1808 in the dwelling house of John Widner, "which house was
                    almost a fort," having been constructed with special reference to making resistance against attacks
                    of Indians. Indeed, there is direct authority for the statement that schoolhouses were constructed
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002992" reg="Washington">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName> with portholes for shooting at the Indians, and if in <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002992" reg="Washington">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>, we have good reason to suppose that they were likewise so constructed elsewhere at the
                    same time. I have not come across any record or tradition to show that a cabin full of school
                    children was ever beleaguered in Indiana, or even that the schoolmasters of the State ever at any
                    time carried rifles to their schools with which to defend their scholars in case of attack; but when
                    we remember how very few of the specific acts of a man or of men, which belong to every-day life and
                    are not required by some law to be entered of record, find their way into history books, we can see
                    that schoolmasters may have gone armed to their schools here in Indiana, and the fact remain
                    unknown; and I have no doubt they did.</p>
                <p>While the old schoolhouses were, whatever their dimensions, generally rectangular in shape, this was
                    not always true. I find an account of two in <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002750" reg="Orange">Orange county</region>
                    </placeName>, in Northwest and Southeast townships respectively, that seem to have been five-sided,
                    one end being built "in the shape of a fence corner for a fireplace." This unique style of
                    architecture may have been practiced elsewhere. In fact, a five-cornered schoolhouse was erected in <placeName>
                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002447" reg="Hancock">Hancock county</region>
                    </placeName> as late as 1830.</p>

                <p>Can those who attended the old cabin schoolhouses ever forget the total want of everything connected
                    with them that was calculated to cheer and comfort the youngster in his ascent of the hill of
                    knowledge? No attempt, whatever, was ever made by the men who constructed these houses toward
                    beautifying them in any degree, and, judged by the standards of to-day, not much was done with a
                    view to securing the comfort of the children.</p>
                <p>The following description of an old time schoolhouse and its furnishings is taken from "Recollections
                    of the Early Settlement of the <geogName key="tgn_2746502" reg="Wabash River">Wabash</geogName>
                    Valley," by Sanford C. Cox:</p>
                <p>"The schoolhouse was generally a log cabin with puncheon floor, ‘cat and clay’ chimney, and a part of
                    two logs chopped away on each side of the house for windows, over which greased newspapers or
                    foolscap was pasted to admit the light and keep out the cold. The house was generally furnished with
                    a split [splint] bottom chair for the teacher, and rude benches made out of slabs or puncheons for
                    the children to sit upon, so arranged as to get the benefit of the huge log fire in the winter time,
                    and the light from the windows. To these add a broom, a water-bucket, and a tin cup or gourd, and
                    the furniture list will be complete."</p>
                <p>The writer omits one important adjunct, viz., the writing-table or bench, as it was in some
                    schoolhouses not inappropriately called. This usually consisted of a broad board, sawed or sometimes
                    rived, nailed to stout pins driven into holes bored in the logs at a proper slant upward beneath the
                    long window. In the absence of a suitable board, a puncheon hewn to a smooth face, or even a
                    half-log so hewn and mounted upon pins driven into the wall or upon stakes driven into the earth,
                    was made to serve the purpose of a lighter writing table.</p>
                <p>It would be a waste of words to point out the squalor and discomfort of the old cabin schoolhouses.
                    Most of us, however, who caught glimpses of learning within their portals in our younger days, think
                    we treasure very tender recollections of them, but I suspect the tender recollections are of the
                    youthful friendships we then formed, and of the surrounding woods and streams that witnessed
                    indulgence in all manner of lawful sports, without a shadow of fear of trespassing on the rights of
                    others.</p>

                    settlement of that locality. The following brief statement from Mr. Cyrus W. Hodgin, president of
                    the Centennial Association, will give an idea of the movement:</p>

                    event. At its meeting in November, 1905, the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Society appointed a committee to consult with the City Council and a number
                    of other organizations concerning an appropriate celebration of the centennial of the beginning of
                    the town. The Council approved, and appointed a cooperating committee. A Centennial Association has
                    been organized, consisting of representatives chosen by nearly one hundred fraternal societies,
                    churches, and literary, charitable and business organizations. A number of standing committees have
                    been appointed to promote various phases of the plan, and the work of preparation for the event is
                    now well under way.</p>
                <p>"There will be six days devoted to the celebration, beginning September 11, and closing on Sunday,
                    the 16th. It will be a time of home-coming for former residents, and a program of excellent variety
                    and high character will be presented for the enjoyment of all. Old Richmondites are invited to send
                    for announcements."</p>
                <p>From this it will be seen that there is promise of a general awakening in <placeName>

                    </placeName> along this line. Indeed, the editor will personally testify to this, for in a recent
                    visit to "The Queen of all the Hoosier Plain" he found not a few citizens deeply engrossed in the
                    past story of their community, and all available sources are being drawn upon. Old newspaper files
                    are being <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-002-1-054"/> hunted up, and the people are urged to ransack their
                    chests and attics in search of papers and relics. The first <placeName>

                    out of the county has one of those directories, now is the time to find a market for it. The press,
                    particularly <hi rend="i">Tne Sun- Telegram</hi>, is pushing the movement along with enthusiasm, and
                    will be an effective instrument in promoting popular interest by its publication through the summer

                                <p>"Your letter of the 28th ult., came yesterday. You asked me how I started this work.
                                    It was simply by giving a boy's autograph collection, and being obliged to come here
                                    and see that it was taken care of, where it would otherwise have been utterly
                                    wasted. In order to get a case for its reception, I had to ‘hang around’ the capitol
                                    some little time at my own expense. It did not seem that I could leave the
                                    collection unguarded without danger of its destruction, so I stayed and stayed. A
                                    little investigation showed me that the State was doing nothing at that time to
                                    preserve the materials of its history, so in a small way I began to ‘beg’ files of
                                    newspapers, books, pamphlets and public documents which were out of print, and which
                                    were not otherwise <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-002-1-055"/> much esteemed, but which
                                    contained some of the materials that a State historian would require. I found that <placeName>

                                    </placeName> counties, while our State Library contained but half that number, with
                                    only one dilapidated volume on North American Indians, and on several tribes that
                                    had made their homes in what is now <placeName>

                                <p>"Gradually, these ideas forced themselves upon me, and before I was hardly aware of
                                    it, I became a collector. I soon began to receive prehistoric stone implements, arms
                                    which were in use in the civil war, specimens of birds and animals, minerals,
                                    fossils, ancient implements and furniture, etc., etc. Seeing what I was doing, the
                                    Legislature finally gave me the use of three vacant rooms in the basement of the
                                    capitol building. Looking back upon those days it seems an incomparably short time
                                    until the rooms were filled to overflowing. Then, gradually the idea of a building
                                    for this special purpose seemed to be evolved, and matters progressed in the usual
                                    way until June 17, 1899, when the cornerstone of the present edifice was laid by
                                    Governor Shaw. Since then, our progress has been quite rapid. Our museum has
                                    developed until it has become an object of State-wide attraction, not to the people
                                    of wealth and to those who travel widely, but to the common people of <placeName>

                                    colleges and libraries, as well as individuals, all over the country. I have been

                <p>A pamphlet of some fifteen or twenty thousand words bearing this title has recently been issued by F.
                    A. Myers, of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. As the sub-title implies, it is a study in the sources that touch upon the old post,
                    and particularly upon the date of its establishment. There is ample evidence in the text that the
                    study has been searching and painstaking, and it has much collateral information that is of
                    interest. Just what it adds to the subject only an expert could tell. We frankly confess ourselves
                    somewhat stupid in the attempt to get at the merits of this particular kind of a question. The date
                    of the establishment of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> is involved in much haze, and the probabilities are that it will never be less hazy.
                    The evidence at best but affords grounds for surmise, and the surmising varies with the ingenuity of
                    the investigator, just as, in the contentions that spring up, the most ingenious reasoner triumphs
                    quite regardless, perhaps, of the actual facts in the case. Mr. Myers takes vigorous exceptions to
                    certain conclusions of Mr. J. P. Dunn on this subject, but we think he might have presented a
                    clearer summary of his own argument, the exact scope of which is uncertain on a casual reading. The
                    pamphlet, nevertheless, we repeat, is a careful and lengthy study of the question from such data as
                    exist, and as such should be in the collection of every one who is gathering Indiana material. The

                    believed that this fort stood at a point some three miles up the river, but Mr. Smith makes it
                    tolerably clear that the establishment located there was not the fort, but a garrison, and that
                    there has arisen a confusion respecting the two. He makes an appeal to the Daughters of the
                    Revolution to place a marker at this site, as they have already marked old Fort Sackville.</p>

                                    </placeName>, have suggested to me an explanation of a discovery made by me while
                                    examining some of the mounds in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county" key="tgn_1002320" reg="De Kalb">DeKalb county</region>
                                    </placeName>. I examined a great many of these mounds. Most of them contained human
                                    bones, fragments of pottery, and an occasional arrow-head, stone hammer, or stone
                                    flesher.</p>
                                <p>Two of these mounds were on the bank of Cedar creek, about one-half mile northwest of
                                    Waterloo. Large trees were growing around them, and quite a large tree grew about in
                                    the center of one of them,—the smaller of the two. The large mound was about twelve
                                    feet in diameter, and about four and one-half or five feet in hight. It contained
                                    the skeleton of one person, apparently buried in a sitting posture. The other
                                    contained the remains of a number of persons. The bodies had apparently been placed
                                    in a heap on the ground, and covered with earth. Fractures of some of the skulls
                                    indicated violent deaths. Above the earth covering the bodies was a layer of stone
                                    and over this more earth and a thick layer of charcoal mingled with charred <pb
                                        n="56" id="VAA4025-002-1-060"/> fragments of human bones. At that time, after a
                                    careful examination, I concluded that these mounds marked the site of a battle; that
                                    the victors of those left in possession of the field had made these mounds the
                                    burial place of their dead, and had burned the bodies of their dead enemies on the
                                    mound above them. The description of the old torture stake at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014174" reg="Muncie">Muncie</settlement>
                                    </placeName> suggests that instead of the bodies of their dead enemies, they may
                                    have burned living victims.</p>
