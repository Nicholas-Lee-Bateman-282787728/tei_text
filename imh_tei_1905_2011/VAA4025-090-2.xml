            <p>"I should not object to gentlemen indulging in a frolic of this kind were there none but
                    Hoosiers here," a member of the Indiana constitutional convention of 1850–1851
                    remarked after passage of a mock resolution (to round up absent delegates) that had provoked what
                    the stenographer recorded as "roars of laughter, accompanied by loud knockings at the door,
                    which caused renewed laughter." Hoosiers might find it harmless, "but there are
                    strangers present," he cautioned, "and this conduct may produce an unfavorable
                    impression on their minds."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Indiana wit has been impressing the rest of the country ever since, not always unfavorably, even
                    where "hoosier" connotes something like "redneck" or
                    "cracker"; in <placeName>

                    the original northern English "hoozer."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> For representative
                    mid-nineteenth-century Indianans in convention assembled, to be a Hoosier was to be sly in something
                    of the outwardly obtuse manner more recently exploited by such comedians as Herb Shriner or David
                    Letterman. Did it inspire the writers of the television series "Cheers," when
                    casting a shrewdly naïve assistant bartender, to have "Woody" come from <placeName>

                    vicepresidents from Indiana, Dan Quayle's odd locutions may prove less memorable than Tom
                    Marshall's aphorism about the five-cent cigar, but they have the ring, however inadvertent,

                    Bernardi, a veritable embodiment of Hoosierdom, especially when he skewered the uncomprehending new
                    lieutenant obliged to eat with us at the single mess table on our Panamanian gun position.</p>
            <p>To be sure, most of the speeches embalmed in 2,078 double-column pages of unleaded minion
                    (7–point type) in the published Indiana debates of 1850–1851 are as drearily
                    verbose as those—also recorded verbatim—in of any of the other dozen states
                    that held constitutional conventions in the 1840s and 1850s. Virtually none indulge in the
                    "spread eagle" bombast of the time; instead, unlike the Fourth of July or
                    campaign-stump speaker, the plain-spoken delegates endeavored to bring the unconverted around to
                    their position on such controversial subjects as banks and business corporations, the public debt (a
                    pressing problem since the panic of 1837), term limits ("rotation in office"),
                    division of power between state and localities, the property rights of wives or of
                    blacks—indeed, exclusion of blacks from the state. Laying out fundamental republican
                    principles, historical precedents, and the expediency of this or that proposed policy left little
                    occasion in other states than Indiana for humor, and then usually of a well-worn sort. In <placeName>

                    </placeName> the delegate was a rare bird who applied the familiar joke about the guest in a country
                    tavern who insisted that butter and flies be served on separate plates to segregation of black
                    schoolchildren. "Scarcer than hen's teeth" and "in a Pickwickian
                    sense" were unusual enough to make Ohioans laugh.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>In the Indiana convention such wit was much commoner and usually more original. If as composed a

            <p>Among the delegates themselves such denseness seems to have been more than a joke. One notion, which
                    hardly occurred to anyone in other state conventions, simply would not down no matter how often its
                    weakness was exposed. It concerned eminent domain, the power of government or a corporation
                    chartered by it to seize private property needed for a new canal or railroad. Elsewhere usually the
                    only question was whether the required fair compensation should be paid before or after
                    construction. In Indiana, procorpo-rate speakers not only beat back demands that payment come first,
                    they insisted that the eventual benefits that the property owner would enjoy made it unnecessary to
                    compensate him at all. In other states the fallacy, once explained, seems to have been obvious: that
                    neighbors whose land was <hi rend="i">not</hi> taken would enjoy the same benefits without any loss.
                    In Indiana this had to be repeated half a dozen times in the course of a five-day debate; not until
                    someone thought to ask how the property owner would benefit if <hi rend="i">all</hi> his land were
                    seized did the point get through. Were those Hoosiers who clung so long to the notion deliberately
                    evasive (even the astute Niles tried to raise it again much later), or were they as peculiarly

                        <p>A gentleman was once married to a lady of considerable property, who was himself poor.
                            Immediately after the marriage, he fixed his house up in fine order, selecting expensive
                            furniture, and paying for it with the lady's money. Afterwards, upon a certain day,
                            they had many visitors to call on them, and the husband was showing the furniture of the
                            house, and everything that was splendid and valuable, in the equipage, with which he was
                            furnished, and calling it all his own.—My fine sideboard, my splendid carpet,
                            &amp;c.: and, no doubt, he did very wrong to talk in this way. Well, after the visitors
                            had left, the lady took occasion to tell the husband that he should have said,
                            "these are our things;" and not that "they are my
                            things:" and there was certainly some justice and right in this appeal. But
                            finally, they got into a quarrel, and then they got to fighting about the matter; and the

                            absolutely kicked him out of doors, and shut the door in his face. The gentleman, finding
                            himself badly whipped, gathered himself up and sat upon a stump near by—(that is
                            the way they tell the story). There he studied about the matter, and finally determined to
                            leave the lady who had taken it upon herself to treat him so harshly. But how was he to
                            proceed? He was kicked out of doors, and his hat was still in the house. He could not leave
                            without his hat; so he marched up, cautiously, and slipped open the door, just far enough to
                            speak to his conqueror, and, looking in timidly upon his wife, he ventured to say to her,
                            "My dear, will you please to hand me our hat:" [Merriment.] Well, the
                            manner of this salutation of her husband, rather pleased the lady. She was pleased with the
                            idea of his coming over to her views, so far as to say "our;" and it put a
                            smile upon her face; and, seeing a smile upon the face of his wife, the gentleman at once
                            gave over his resolution to leave. And, from that day to this, (as the story concludes,)
                            when speaking of anything pertaining to the common house-hold interest, he has never
                            forgotten to say "our." [Renewed merriment.]</p>

            <p>But limited income was only one of the banes of publishing. Lack of paper was a common complaint. In
                    Indiana and elsewhere no pioneer newspaper held to a regular publishing schedule. In favorable
                    weather, little cash in the printer's till prevented stockpiling newsprint for which mill
                    owners wanted hard specie. Furthermore, printers had to go by the loose calendar of freight wagon
                    and river craft operators who brought paper to them. Inclement weather would hold up a shipment for
                    weeks. And coupled with these problems was the wanderlust inherent in many journeymen printers and
                    apprentices who bolted printing offices before completing their obligations. Mail service was
                    inefficient and erratic, and since western editors depended on exchange papers from the east for
                    national and world news, a common complaint was "No mail this week"; hence, no
                    news. Subscribers who lived at a distance from the printing office, thus receiving their paper by
                    mail, sometimes would go for weeks before seeing an issue. Snapped one Indiana editor: "The
                    [mail] contractors in this state have got into the mischievous habit <hi rend="i">of farming</hi>
                    out their business, and it often falls into the hands of ignorant, negligent, slothful, careless
                    fellows, who know no more of their business than the starved brutes upon which they ride &amp;.
                    Until a different arrangement and peremptory change takes place in the Mail Department, printers and
                    their patrons must suffer from the brutality of those who have it in their power to perplex
                        them."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Although Indiana printers were some distance from printer supply houses, their presses were simple
                    yet sturdy in construction and virtually unchanged from the wood press developed by Johann Gutenberg
                    in the mid-fifteenth century. If the need arose, they could be repaired by a local blacksmith or
                    carpenter. Printers short on ink could make their own although the process was messy and srnelly.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                            in the paper-making process, vats in the few mills scattered across the western country were
                            often frozen solid, thus unable to produce the precious commodity. Even if printers had

                    ever westward? "Why did they cling so tenaciously to their chosen job?" asked
                    newspaper historian Douglas McMurtrie. "Why were they willing to endure all the hardships
                    of a pioneer printer's life? Why did they go on year after year, with very little
                    improvement in their status? I think it was because most of these printers were idealists. They had
                    seen, out in this western country, materials for the making of a new empire. They had caught some
                    vision of what these little towns could some day become, and one of the important services they
                    rendered to their communities was that of promotional salesmen."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    Appearing—the so-called Shakers—established Union Village, a communal
                    settlement a few miles west of <placeName>
                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                    </placeName> where the practice of celibacy was a cardinal principle. Shakers believed that only
                    through withdrawal from the world could a life without sin be realized. Union Village was a tidy,
                    industrious place whose population would grow, through converts, to about five hundred. Almost at
                    the beginning of the settlement the religious rituals of the Shakers, characterized in part by
                    rhythmical dancing (hence the appellation "Shaker"), and their communal lifestyle
                    made them suspect to their neighbors who, save for the Quakers among them, celebrated religion
                    openly, tumultuously, and hysterically at camp meetings, perching on logs in a clearing to clap and
                    shout encouragement to a circuit rider who, bellowing "like a scrub bull in a canebrake
                    during cocklebur season," assured them sulfurous fires awaited if they were not repentant.
                    During these open assemblies considerable emotional intensity developed with many attendants falling
                    in trances and others babbling "in tongues."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>The Union Village Shakers were falsely accused of beating their children, castrating their males,
                    abusing their women, breaking up families of God-fearing folk, goading Indians to wage war, babbling
                    devil-talk, and dancing naked at their night meetings after which they blew out the candles and
                    "went into a promiscuous debauch." Trouble erupted in October, 1805, when several
                    roughnecks invaded Union Village and tore down fences, trampled orchards, broke windows, and set
                    fire to several buildings. This was the first of several ugly incidents. In 1810 about five hundred
                    men confronted the Shakers and made vulgar accusations. During <placeName>

                        or twenty words of the preacher. Another sect, Newlights, worship Him by screaming, clapping

                        backs. Another sect, the Shakers, say they worship God best by singing merry tunes and dancing

                    </placeName>. The settlement was advantageously situated at the eastern edge of the "New
                    Purchase," a vast stretch of almost 8.5 million timbered acres that merged on its western
                    extremity into tall, lush prairie grass. The federal government had acquired the fertile package in
                    1818 from the Miami, Wea, Potawatomie, and <placeName>

                    </placeName>, perhaps because of the bad weather but more likely for economic reasons. A new federal
                    land act would go into effect April 24, 1820, permitting settlers to buy public domain land in
                    tracts as small as eighty acres at a minimum price of $1.25 an acre, payable on purchase.
                    Under the previous land act of 1804 the minimum purchase was 160 acres at $1.64 per acre,
                    although the land could be bought on credit. With the awakening of spring, 1820, then, the Samples
                    said good-bye to their <placeName>

                    stock up for the trip farther west. On Saturdays, farmers and traders swarmed into the settlement
                    "to buy goods, trade in live stock or lands or ‘swap’ horses, hear
                    the news and settle up old scores by arbitration, and not infrequently by fisticuff
                    fights." According to one Indiana historian, about four thousand whites were living in the
                    whole of the New Purchase at the time of the acquisition, and of that number, around two hundred

                    three blacksmiths, and the tailoring shop of David Beck. Taverns and hotels flourished. Among the
                    most popular was John Sample's inn, which was regarded as having the best cooks. Joshua
                    Harland's inn, however, was celebrated for serving the finest whisky. Travelers who wanted
                    their horses well cared for while they were in town were directed to the hotel run by Newton
                    Claypool. The town, whose main part was about five blocks long and two blocks wide, was burgeoning,
                    having spread to the east side of the Whitewater where several cabins, a tannery, and a carding and
                    fulling operation were located.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>The reader may have found some pleasure in "The Rose in January." Written in the
                    first person, the tale is told by a professor of philosophy intent on winning the hand of the fair
                    Mademoiselle Amelia de Belmont by presenting her with a bouquet of roses on New Year's Day.
                    After several failed attempts to cultivate a rose bush, he at last succeeds only to discover one
                    evening a sheep feasting on the plant's buds. Furious, he bludgeons the animal to death
                    with his cane. A moment later he learns from a servant that the sheep was Amelia's pet.
                    Filled with remorse, he tries to revive the animal with <hi rend="i">Eau de Vie</hi>. While doing
                    so, a valuable ring, which Amelia's dead father "had got as a present from the
                    Emperor," tumbles from a collar around the sheep's neck. Meantime, a frantic
                    Amelia searches the streets for the ring; it had slipped from her finger when she was collaring the
                    sheep. The ring is returned, but Amelia, on being told of her pet's brutal end, is
                    inconsolable. But all ends well. On New Year's Day the professor presents Amelia with a
                    newborn lamb garlanded with roses bought from a gardener. In gratitude, Amelia's mother
                    gives the professor permission to marry her daughter.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    "lower room." In November, 1828, Samuel Wilson Parker (1805–1859),

                    cofounder of Miami's Union Literary Society and "an extemporaneous debater and
                    declaimer," the abilities of the "slim, flaxen-haired stripling" were
                    quickly recognized by Rench who certainly saw in Parker a person to assist him in his quest. He
                    appointed Parker an editor, and although such a post provided little or no monetary reward, the
                    position gave Parker a chance for "the advancement of great public interests." The
                    struggle for a better school was successful. The county commissioners approved the construction of a
                    two-story brick seminary, and in May, 1829, the structure nearly completed, Parker was named the
                    school's principal. Classes began two months later.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                        occurring when he was a junior at what is now Indiana University. During a class taught by
                        Andrew Wylie, the school's president, he made a cutting remark to Wylie who at once
                        threatened him with a caning. Dunn gathered up his books and walked out of the room, never to
                        return. In March, 1852, while speaking at the Indiana Whig convention, he spied Governor Joseph
                        Wright, a Democrat, in the audience. "I'm glad you are here,
                        Governor," he said. "Don't leave until I am done. I propose going
                        through you with a lighted candle that all may see what a mass of putrefaction and political

                    those changes was the growing number of the poor. Interest came to be centered on the care of
                    dependent children as a panacea for this visible poverty. Many progressives thought that moving
                    these children from the bad influences of their home environment to a more wholesome one would free

                    separate dependent children from indigent parents who were unable, and therefore unfit, to support
                    them, thereby to rescue the child and save the nation. All over the country enthusiastic reformers

                    the children's institutions during this time give a much more complex picture than that of
                    mere child saving. Children's institutions, sponsored by many religious and ethnic groups
                    in different sections of the country, vaned widely and employed diverse methods.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Some institutions were founded not to rescue children but to help sick parents who were
                    unable to care for their children during epidemics of cholera or with diseases such as tuberculosis.
                    On closer examination, rather than concentrating on clearly-defined social controlling behaviors,
                    child savers often seemed to be in over their heads and, as Ronald D. Cohen says, "groping
                    for answers to problems they only dimly understood."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, many scholars dealing with specific children's institutions relate their
                    findings to the narrow debate over the reformers' motives. Was it social control or
                    benevolence? Did child savers act from self-interest to insure a social order that favored them, or
                    did they act altruistically? Some critics of welfare history have called for a more comprehensive
                    approach to child saving research—one that reaches beyond the institutional bias of the
                    social controlhenevolence debates to include interactive groups (especially clients) and their
                    influence on the policies and practices of the institution. Clarke A. Chambers's trenchant
                    analysis, for example, denigrates welfare historians for focusing on the provision and management of
                    social services and ignoring the role of the <list type="footnotes">

                    of foreign-born residents (around 10 percent), it still had experienced a huge change from its rural
                    beginnings. It was home to 188 small industries, employing 2,746 wage earners. In one generation its

                    county's population (40,063). The value of the county's manufactured products

                    from the County Poor Farm into the new County Children's Home. During the thirty years of
                    this study, from 1887 to 1916, 840 children were admitted to the home for the first time. About half
                    as many, 464, were readmitted. The population of the home remained about the same from decade to
                    decade; the yearly average of first time admittees varied only from twenty-five to thirty. The home
                    housed an equal number of boys and girls. Almost 90 percent of the entrants were under twelve years
                    of age, with the majority of the children being between three and eight. Most of the children came
                    from one-parent families, but the percentage with two parents steadily increased from just 16
                    percent between 1887 and 1896 to about 32 percent between 1897 and 1906. The percentage grew to 43
                    percent between 1907 and 1916. (See Graph A.) About two-thirds of the children arrived at the home
                    with their siblings. Parental destitution and poor relief were the main reasons for commitment to

                    Indiana. After a first bill failed in 1886, the Board of State Charities was finally created by
                    legislative action in 1889.' This board was charged with the duty of investigating the
                    whole system of public charities. The board gave immediate attention to the problem of child
                    welfare, and its members visited children's institutions, collected information, and made
                    recommendations to the state legislature.</p>
            <p>The TCCHA and the Board of State Charities shared the opinion that the best way to care for dependent
                    children was to place them out in foster homes. The members of the TCCHA defined their child saving
                    mission as that of providing temporary institutional care until the children could be placed out in
                    "good homes"; they believed their work benefited more than just the child and that
                    for every child they rescued from "a life of misery and vice" the county was
                    "spared a pauper or a criminal." The Indiana Board of State Charities also
                    believed that "The Placing Out Plan" was the best method of caring for dependent
                    children and that being reared by "industrious foster parents" gave the
                    experiences necessary for "intelligent self respecting citizenship." Both of these
                    fledgling organizations at the state and local level saw institutions in an auxiliary role, serving
                    only as temporary way stations. Their optimistic faith in placing out foresaw no difficulties in
                    finding good substitute parents willing and able to take on the job of raising foster children.
                    Neither organization had any intention of helping or even dealing with parents of dependent
                        children.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Although these two bodies shared a similar child saving mission, they had inherent differences which
                    were epitomized by their founders. The formation of the TCCHA was sparked by Mrs. Tom Cory, the wife
                    of a local businessman, who was inspired by the sight of small children at the County Poor Farm; she
                    simply wanted to rescue children. To accomplish this she turned to the pastor of the Presbyterian
                    church. He with the local Baptist minister called a meeting of interested people—men and
                    women connected to the town's successful agrariadcommercial businesses and united by social
                    ties and a shared protestant background, who then formed the first board. The thirteen members of
                    the board, both men and <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Oscar McCulloch, on the other hand, had a much larger goal in mind than just saving children when he
                    lobbied for a state board of charities. Although he was the pastor of a Congregational church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, his motivation was more secular than religious; he sought efficiency in charities
                    through planned state legislation and wanted to create "order out of chaos." This
                    goal Sollowed from his decade-long involvement in the charity organization society movement. He had
                    studied organized charity methods in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then had founded and led the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Charity Organization Society. After the Board of State Charities was established,
                    McCulloch, as a member of the new board, handpicked the first secretary of that board, Alexander
                    Johnson, another experienced organized charity worker from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These men were the equivalent of professional social workers, although social work had
                    not yet been established as an academic field. The secretary and his successors shaped policy and
                    dominated the state board. In contrast to the Board of State Charities, the TCCHA had no paid
                    professional administrator and was run entirely by its volunteer board.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The TCCHA's goal to save children by placing them out in substitute families ran into
                    difficulties almost immediately. Only about one-third (34 percent) of children leaving the home were
                    placed out with foster parents between 1887 and 1896, and this figure diminished in the succeeding
                    decades to 29 percent between 1897 and 1906 and to 17 percent between 1907 and 1916. (See Graph B.)

                            board. A small core were active leaders over many years. The first president, Colonel
                            Chester G. Thomson, was a Presbyterian, a Republican, and a businessman who owned a small

                    method of choice? The TCCHA could not achieve its goal alone. It needed the cooperation of both the
                    natural parents of the dependent children and the substitute parents who would provide the foster
                    home: natural parents were required to sign a release surrendering their child for placing out, and
                    substitute parents had to volunteer for fostering and then carry through by rearing the child. This
                    essential cooperation was not easy to achieve, as the TCCHA soon discovered.</p>
            <p>Although some natural parents were willing to release their children for placement in foster homes,
                    many parents did not want to sign away their children and took them back rather than give them up.
                    This problem was immediately evident and so severe that at the end of the first year of operation
                    the association petitioned for a state law to place children of unfit parents in "good
                    hands without interference." In addition to their emotional reasons for wanting to keep
                    their own children, families often needed the child's contribution to keep the family
                    afloat. In an 1887 case, for instance, parents coaxed their seven-year-old son away from the home to
                    "beg in the streets." In 1888 a mother took her twelve-year-old daughter back so
                    that she could work in the paper mill.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite the association's vigilance, determined parents managed to "steal"
                    their children. Even those who had been successfully placed out were not safe. For instance, one of
                    the home's first residents, Edna F., was lured from a foster home back to her
                    "miserable" one and was lamented as "a ruined girl, now." The
                    TCCHA attempted to make it plain that placed out children now "belonged to the
                    home" and held many discussions about ways to get back children who had been
                    "spirited away" by their parents. But the problem of interfering, non-cooperative
                    parents remained and vexed the association during the entire period from 1887 through 1916.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Clearly, some parents actively blocked the TCCHA's child saving plans. Others used the
                    children's home for personal reasons. A precedent was set in April of 1887 (the first year
                    of operation) when Robert C., a one-year-old, was taken into the home for a two-and-a-half week stay
                    at his parents' request. They paid $7.50 for his board. Another precedent was
                    established a few months later, when <list type="footnotes">

                    children, expecting her "to be a substantial help for the matron" as soon as she
                    was well. She did work as a domestic in the children's home in return for her
                    family's board.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although directors of the TCCHA had not envisioned the organization as a provider of temporary care
                    at the request of parents, they gradually accepted this role as needy families asked for help. In
                    the first decade eighteen children were supported by mothers working in the home and forty-two more
                    were paid for by parents. This was just 17 percent of the total. The percentage of children whose
                    parents had placed them in the home temporarily increased to 34 percent between 1898 and 1906 and to
                    69 percent in the 1907 to 1916 time period. The steady increase in paid temporary placements brought
                    in larger and larger fees that were included in the treasurer's annual report. (See Graph
                    C.)</p>
            <p>The reasons for parents' requesting to board their children varied widely. One widower
                    placed his three children in accordance with his wife's death-bed wish. A mother who had
                    run away from an abusive husband needed child care to enable her to work as a live-in domestic. In
                    general, children with two parents were much less likely to be boarded than those with only one
                    parent. Only 30 percent of the children supported by paying or working parents were from two-parent
                    families. These children also stayed for shorter periods of time. The median length of stay for
                    children with two parents was just thirty-five days, it was forty-one days for those with just
                    mothers and fifty days for those with fathers only. Often, when one of two parents was
                    incapacitated, the couple's children were boarded just until that parent recovered. For
                    example, in 1915, a father placed five children in the home and paid $7 a week for their
                    care while their mother was hospitalized.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rather than being boarded just for the duration of a temporary setback, children with one parent
                    frequently were placed for longer periods because of chronic need; their mothers or fathers, trapped
                    in low-paying labor and domestic jobs, were unable to work and care for children at the same time.
                    Many of them kept in touch with their children, however, both visiting them in the home and taking
                    them out for visits. For instance, when Mrs. S.'s employer, Dr. Coulter, went on vacation,
                    he allowed her to take her children into his house for the summer. A similar case involved a single
                    father who took back his son temporarily while he was laid off from his job at the Monon Shops.
                    Often a remarriage allowed for the reunification of the family. In 1913, for example, Mr. H.
                    reclaimed his children after he married a "good sensible" woman "with a
                    few acres <list type="footnotes">

                    possible. In 1907 a mother who had boarded her children at the home for two years took them back
                    after she inherited some money from a relative and bought a farm.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The TCCHA ran its temporary boarding service as a business. Parents who needed to have their children
                    cared for at the home could apply to the Reception Committee. The committee judged the worthiness of
                    the situation and arranged for some sort of payment from the parents. The actual amount was adjusted
                    to the individual case. In 1894, for example, Mrs. O. paid half of her three-dollar-a-week salary as
                    a domestic for one of her children, while the township trustee paid for the other child out of poor
                    relief funds. Mothers frequently worked at the children's home to pay their
                    children's board, an arrangement which gave the matron some much-needed help. The TCCHA
                    terminated the agreement when the mother's work did not meet expectations; one mother was
                    sent back to the County Poor Farm with her child, because she made more work "than she
                    accomplished." Some mothers left when they found a better situation, which was the case for
                    one woman in 1894 who worked in the home just until she could find a place to sew.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The TCCHA was unsentimental about payment for services rendered and often had meetings to discuss
                    ways to extract outstanding amounts owed. In July of 1898 when little Charles B. died in the home,
                    the TCCHA was careful to charge his mother for the expenses of his medical care and funeral. After
                    the Board of Children's Guardians and the Juvenile Court were formed in Tippeca-noe County
                    in 1906 and 1907, the TCCHA referred defaulting parents to these bodies for legal action. Very few
                    parents were allowed to place their children gratis, and then only under special circumstances and
                    for a limited time. The February, 1916, board minutes noted such a case of "real
                    Charity" when they kept five siblings, aged two to eleven, while their widowed mother
                    recuperated from an operation.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even though the TCCHA had accommodated its practices to fit natural parents' needs, it still
                    clung to and promoted the idea of child saving by placing out. If parents were unable to make their
                    payments, they were expected to release their children for placement in foster homes. For instance,
                    in 1913 a defaulting mother was given three choices: pay up, come get the child, or sign him <list type="footnotes">

                    domestic, had paid $50.75 but still owed $45.50; she had fallen behind because
                    of sickness. As was explained in an annual report, "If there seems to be no hope that they
                    [the parents] will be able to take the children and support them, we often can then persuade them to
                    let us place the child in a good home and thus save the county from another pauper."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The TCCHA's annual reports reflect a changing attitude toward parents' worthiness.
                    At first the reports gave only negative accounts of the children's home environments,
                    describing the "filth and degradation" of "homes of vicious
                    poverty" where the children's "bright active minds were traced with
                    defacing lines seamed and scarred by premature conflict with sin and life's
                    bitterness—the laws of heredity in the balance against them." These reports also
                    deplored the children's return to their parents, expecting them to be "dragged
                    down to their [the parents'] wretched habits." Such child-saving rhetoric gave the
                    impression that all the parents with whom the association dealt were unfit to raise their own
                        children.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the years between 1897 and 1906 the portrayal of parents in the annual reports softened. While
                    some still contained derogatory elements (one even expressed the wish that the children were all
                    orphans so that the association did not have to fear their return to the low level of their
                    parents), others presented parents in a more positive light, conceding that just being poor did
                    "not always destroy the parental love." After 1906, negative descriptions of
                    parental homes were almost entirely absent in the annual reports. The larger environment,
                    "the temptations and pitfalls of the world," were now identified as evil.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Descriptions of the TCCHA's growing service of parental boardings began to appear in the
                    annual reports of the second decade. In 1898, for example, the report told of parents "who
                    paid a little something" toward their children's board until they could
                    "again take them and care for them."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> These descriptions of
                    the boarding service, however, did not reveal the fact that it was becoming the home's
                    primary service.</p>
            <p>The TCCHA's added service of temporary boarding was in conflict with the policy of the Board
                    of State Chanties on ways to help dependent children. Although the state board realized that
                    temporary board was provided by many of the county orphan homes, including the one in <placeName>

                    "objectionable feature" that allowed parents who were "well able to
                    support their children" to shift their reponsibility to others. They saw the large numbers
                    of children who were returned to parents from orphan homes as proof that the parents were receiving
                    unwarranted aid,<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The efforts of the Board of State Charities resulted in the enactment of state laws that made it
                    impossible to support children in orphan homes with public funds unless they were released by their
                    parents and made wards. The new laws brought a more constrictive legal procedure to effect wardship.
                    But legal changes did not eliminate the practice of accepting temporary placements at orphan homes.
                    The placements were still made and were paid for in other ways, such as private donations or
                    parental payments. However, even if parents themselves were required to pay to "the point
                    of self denial," the state board still opposed temporary arrangements, calling them
                    "of doubtful value" because they made it too easy for parents to shirk their
                        responsibilities.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The state board's negative attitude toward parents and parent boarding, unaffected by actual
                    interactions with parents, remained essentially unchanged. To the Board of State Charities poor
                    parents remained suspect. They were seen as leading their children "into
                    pauperdom" by teaching them that it was "unnecessary &amp; to engage in honest
                    employment or to master a trade or education or occupation requiring time or effort." The
                    state board felt that parents of dependent children could and should obtain help only from existing
                    county poor relief; even then, the board averred, the children were "supported in idleness
                    or dissapation."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Natural parents were not the only obstructions to the TCCHA's goal of saving children by
                    placing them out in substitute families. Child saving required substitute parents willing to commit
                    to the rearing of a foster child. The TCCHA had trouble finding and keeping such foster parents.</p>

                    it easy to become a foster parent, but, if the children did not please, it was also easy to dump
                    them. The TCCHA gave assurances that children who did not prove satisfactory "would be
                    taken back without hesitancy"; any child could be taken "on trial" and

                    1887 to 1906 only about 26 percent went to foster families. This small percentage was reduced to 12
                    percent in the years between 1907 and 1916. (See Graph D.) On average, children waiting to be placed
                    in a foster home stayed at the children's home twice as long (402 days) as those who

            <p>Another indication of the lack of available foster homes was the concern of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe County</region>
                    </placeName> commissioners over costs at the children's home. A child at the
                    children's home cost the taxpayers a twenty-five-cent per diem, while a child in a foster
                    home cost taxpayers nothing. In 1894 and 1896 the commissioners called on the TCCHA to explain why
                    children remained in the children's home so long instead of being rapidly placed out in
                    foster homes. To recruit more homes the TCCHA in 1896 advertised in the newspapers for country homes
                    for children, just as they had asked for places for boys on farms in 1889.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, the TCCHA board members welcomed outside help in recruiting families. From 1894 to 1896
                    they used the service of the Children's Home Society, a private statewide placing agency.
                    In 1896 a city missionary, Mrs. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, arranged many placements and even took children to the annual meeting of Quakers held
                    at the Farmer's Institute to introduce them to possible foster parents. Beginning in 1897,
                    state legislation gave the TCCHA a partner in the job of finding "good homes": a
                    state agent who was to assist in the placement of children and their subsequent supervision. By 1916
                    there were eight state employees doing this work; nonetheless, the help of the state did not
                    eliminate the problems with supply. As was previously noted, the percentage of foster placements in

            <p>Forty-three percent of the children placed in foster homes for the first time were returned to the
                    children's home. Many of those returned were placed out repeatedly. The usual explanation
                    for failed foster placements was that the child <hi rend="i">did not give satisfaction</hi>. The
                    TCCHA board minutes use this stark phrase over and over again. More detailed explanations often
                    pointed to unsatisfactory work performance. In 1888, for instance, Lucy G. was returned as not old
                    enough to do the work wanted and in 1898 Jim M. as too small to do farm work. The sad fact was that
                    many foster parents were motivated by a desire to gain cheap labor rather than a benevolent wish to
                    rear middle-class children. Foster parents returned younger children for different reasons: Alice C.
                    was untruthful; Dora V. was a thief; Dottie did not talk plain; and baby C. was cross and unwell.
                    Even adoptions were not forever. Opal S.'s new family, for instance, returned her because
                    of her adoptive mother's poor health.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>Although the board minutes include descriptions of children's unsatisfactory performances in
                    foster homes, they refer only occasionally, and then obliquely, to problems with the foster parents
                    themselves. In 1890, for example, the matron discovered that Edith P.'s foster home
                    "was not the place for a child." The minutes refer to a particularly poignant case
                    which took place in 1906 when Betty H.'s father and brother came to the board complaining
                    that Betty was dying from harsh treatment in her foster home of four years. Betty was returned to
                    her family and was at first reported to be improving slowly. Five months later the association
                    approved an expenditure of $1.50 for a spray of flowers for her funeraL<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite the fact that the TCCHA was aware that some parents mistreated their foster children, it did
                    not act to remedy the problem. After just three months of operation the board decided that
                    "in future they must be very particular in regard to homes to which children were
                    taken," but the TCCHA took no steps to do so. The board frequently expressed concern
                    regarding selection and supervision, but although the matron was sent to investigate on occasion,
                    these concerns were never translated into the adoption of regular corrective procedures. The
                    volunteer board had many responsibilities, including raising funds, operating the home, and dealing
                    with natural parents and foster parents, and it neglected foster parent selection and supervision.
                    It was not until 1912 that one board member was assigned to look after foster homes and make routine
                    visits. Even then, mistakes were made. A newspaper article of August, 1913, reported that
                    twelve-year-old Thomas L. was picked up by the police on his way back to the children's
                    home from a foster family in Brookston. He ran away because of the severe beatings he had received
                    for not doing the required work. He showed the officers a bad cut and several scars on his arms made
                    by his foster father with an iron rod, as well as a badly bruised ear from a blow by his foster
                    mother. The board minutes simply said "after investigating the home it was found not
                    suitable for the boy."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The TCCHA's reticence in detailing problems with foster homes was even more evident in the
                    annual reports than in the board minutes; the yearly public statements only mentioned the difficulty
                    in finding foster homes in a few off-hand requests for help. Addressing the problem of potential
                    foster parents' ulterior motives, the 1906 annual report appealed for families who did not
                    want "to save a servant's wage, but were sincere and earnest in wishing to help a
                    child." The board ignored the failure of foster placements by reporting the number of
                    returned children without explanation. Gradually <list type="footnotes">

                    seem to be permanent," or "that doubtless will be permanent." In the 1908
                    report the two reasons for the large return to the children's home from foster homes were
                    tersely presented: "some of the homes not being satisfactory, we request their return, in
                    other cases the children did not suit those who had taken them away."<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tone of the annual reports toward those foster parents who returned children grew a little more
                    critical over time. In 1912 the board commiserated with impatient foster parents: "Can we
                    wonder when even some parents grow impatient with their own children." But by 1917 the
                    board's response sharpened to reproach of foster parents for being unable to
                    "withstand the imperfections of the child's nature" and to condemnation
                    for foster families who thought of a child as a "play thing." The TCCHA also began
                    to take responsibility for some of the failures in placing out children; the annual report of 1909
                    explained: "Many mistakes were made in choosing the home for the child and they must be
                    rectified." These mistakes, though, were described as "errors of the head and not
                    of the heart." Although members of the TCCHA did eventually acknowledge the scarcity of
                    foster parents and failures of foster homes in their annual reports, they did not make public the
                    severity of the problem.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Board of State Charities was well aware that county orphan homes were not successful in
                    implementing the child saving method of choice, placing out in foster families; but the state board
                    did not cite inadequate supply of possible substitute parents as contributing to this failure. In
                    fact, it stated that Indiana, with its "plentiful" food and population
                    "not yet too thick," had a "wealth in her family homes open to
                    children." That many of the possible foster parents who comprised this so-called
                    "wealth" were motivated by self-interest and did not desire children "for
                    their own sakes" was admitted. Those who were only looking for "cheap
                    servants" were acceptable for a child whose "only hope in life is to be a
                    menial." Teaching a child "to work and respect honest labor" was the most
                    important job of good foster parents, but care had to be taken that the child be matched to the home
                    and not be overworked.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

            <p>The state board realized that better selection of foster homes and "proper and
                    sufficient" supervision would improve fostering, and it successfully lobbied for the
                    aforementioned state agent to do this work. It was the intention of the resulting 1897 state
                    legislation that all children in foster families be visited at least once a year by the state agent
                    to "reconcile adverse conditions and prevent trouble" and to encourage both the
                    child and the foster parent. Because the single state agent was unable to visit all the wards in the
                    state, the Board of State Charitieg lobbied for more workers and got them one at a time. Finally, in
                    1913, with an increased work force (seven field workers and one state agent) the objective of annual
                    visits to all children was met. But increased supervision did not stop the failure of many foster
                        placements.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The state board found two other culprits for the continuing failures: the natural parents and the
                    county orphan homes. The board's 1892 report claimed that "a constant difficulty
                    in finding the best homes, which is encountered in nearly every county, is in the disinclination of
                    people to take into their families little children from their own neighborhood, owing to the danger
                    of interference and annoyance from the relatives of the children, often disreputable or
                        dissolute."<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every annual report from 1907 through 1916 contained an attack on the small county orphan homes for
                    failing to train the children to fit into a normal family. The state board cited frequent criticisms
                    of foster parents that children from institutions had to be taught "the simplest tasks of
                    farm and household duties." In addition to teaching such everyday skills as respect for
                    elders and table manners, the county homes were supposed to provide industrial training for older
                    boys and girls and correct physical defects including bad teeth and enlarged tonsils. If a child out
                    on trial was returned, the orphan home was expected to analyze the failure and "give the
                    child what it needs to modify the deficiency."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>The state board's solution for neutralizing the effects of disruptive parents and improving
                    the training of potential foster children was to replace the several county children's
                    homes with one central state institution. This state institution would train the children properly
                    before placing them out and would place the children as far from their natural parents as
                    possible—"beyond the bounds of evil reputation of antecedents." In 1912
                    Indiana's General Assembly finally authorized the establishment of this state institution
                    but never appropriated any money for it, so the idea never reached fruition.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>What impact did the Board of State Charities have on the local practices and policies of the TCCHA?
                    Through 1896 the two bodies had a cordial and complimentary relationship. The members of the board
                    of TCCHA attended conferences on charity sponsored by the state board, and the state board made
                    annual inspections of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> Children's Home. A number of these visits produced positive reports, such as
                    the one on September 29, 1891, where the home was found to be "well furnished and
                    equipped," with "sufficient help &amp; to keep the house and children in good
                    order"; the children were found to be "well fed and clothed; and the management
                    was said to be "excellent."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Relations between the two organizations changed, however, after legislation in 1897 (lobbied for by
                    the Board of State Charities) created a state agency for dependent children under the state board.
                    The Board of State Charities became more than just an advisor. With the state agency now responsible
                    for all work with dependent children maintained at public expense, county orphan homes such as the
                    TCCHA were obliged to report to the state. Although the TCCHA was glad to have the state
                    agent's help in finding foster homes and happily reported the change in the annual report
                    of 1897––"of the 13 children placed in good and permanent homes, part
                    of these have been through the agency of our new state agent, W. B.
                    Streeter"—the board minutes also record some transitional friction. In October
                    of 1897 the secretary tells of some "mistakes" the state agent had made in regard
                    to homes and in March of 1898 the TCCHA was upset by the unwarranted "censure" by
                    the state agent of a child returned from a state-found home. However, the very next month the matron
                    told of "a fine home" the state agent had found. On the whole, the TCCHA and the
                    state agent worked together harmoniously on foster placements.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

            <p>Behind the scenes, however, the Board of State Charities was working for an exchange of power. Seeing
                    that Indiana was supporting more dependent children at a much higher cost than <placeName>

                    </placeName> (states with a central state institution rather than county orphan homes), the state
                    board lobbied for more state control over dependent children. They wanted "more
                    centralization with regard to the care of dependent children, a more definite placing of
                    responsibility, and more active efforts in placing children in family homes [which] would, without
                    doubt, lead to a reduction in the number of children supported, a lessening of the public expense
                    and better work for the children."<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most of the suggested changes were gradually enacted by the state legislature, and each one
                    diminished the powers of the TCCHA (and all other county orphan homes). In 1901 the Board of
                    Children's Guardians law authorized statewide court-appointed county boards for the
                    protection of children who had been "abandoned, neglected or cruelly treated by parents or
                    guardians." It also empowered county officials to commit children to orphan homes,
                    indenture children, or have them adopted "without the consent of their parents"
                    but with the consent of the court. This act gave another body the power to place children in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe County</region>
                    </placeName> Children's Home. And in 1907 the juvenile court law took away the
                    TCCHA's authority to make children wards and place them on public support. The court became
                    the sole authority for this action. In 1909 annual written licenses to be approved by the Board of
                    State Charities were required for all children's institutions.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe County</region>
                    </placeName>, when the Board of Children's Guardians and Juvenile Court started working
                    together in 1907, there was an immediate effect on the TCCHA's practice. As a result of
                    successful cases against "unfit" parents in the juvenile court, the Board of
                    Children's Guardians placed many children removed from their "bad"
                    environments in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe County</region>
                    </placeName> Children's Home. This sudden influx of new residents pushed the population
                    over capacity and beyond the abilities of the matron to care for them. Consequently, when the Board
                    of Children's Guardians transferred some children to White's Manual Labor Training
                    Institute, a large children's institution operated by the Indiana Yearly Meeting of the
                    Quakers in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, they were refused admittance because of lice infestations. The Board of
                    Children's Guardians, embarrassed by this event, condemned the children's home for
                    its "crowded and unsanitary conditions" as well as for "the lack of
                    training and the slow improvement of table manners and habits of thrift and cleanliness."

                    board acted to have sixteen residents removed from the children's home to other
                    institutions, pointedly asking that "each child be made clean and ready to leave."
                    Since the Board of Children's Guardians was responsible for the overcrowded conditions, the
                    TCCHA felt humiliated and wronged. All it could do, however, was to correct conditions by enlarging
                    the building in accord with the specifications set by the Board of State Charities.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

            <p>The TCCHA had become impotent, losing its central place in county child welfare and its authority to
                    affect directly children on public support. The one area where the TCCHA retained control was in its
                    service of boarding children (non-wards) as a temporary help to parents. That service was not
                    supported by tax dollars but by private donations and parental payments. Boarding grew to be the
                    TCCHA's primary service.</p>
            <p>Even though the Board of State Charities gained a large measure of control over county institutions
                    and dependent children through state legislation, its direct influence on TCCHA's practice
                    was limited to the minority of residents who were wards. The TCCHA continued to board increasing
                    numbers of children despite condemnation by the state board. The actions of the Board of State
                    Charities could have contributed indirectly to the continuation of boarding practices by causing the
                    TCCHA to reacts to its own legislated impotence by becoming more open to parent placements where
                    they still had control.</p>
            <p>As the Progressive Era was ending, help was available for needy children in conjunction with their
                    parents—not solely in separation from them as it had been thirty years before. Why had
                    this local service for local children developed, notwithstanding the progressive trend away from
                    localism toward integrated central control and government intervention? It could be argued that the
                    TCCHA held on to a nineteenth-century local volunteer orientation because of its consistently
                    conservative board members or because <placeName>

                    the institutional bias of welfare historians.</p>
            <p>The founders of both the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe County</region>
                    </placeName> Children's Home Association and the Indiana Board of State Charities shared a
                    common Progressive Era perception of dependent children as having only tenuous ties to their parents
                    that could be snipped and reat-tached permanently to good substitute families. The state board was
                    as fully convinced in 1916 that placing out was the best way to help dependent children as it had
                    been in 1890. The TCCHA's child saving preconceptions, however, were undermined in the very
                    first months of operation of its children's home. Its services were shaped by interactions
                    with active partners—natural parents and foster parents. From these interactions the
                    TCCHA learned that natural parents of dependent children were not all bad and that substituted
                    parents were not all good; they learned that children could not easily be separated from their
                    natural parents, nor would foster children necessarily be assimilated into a substitute family as if
                    they belonged there. The realities of their practice forced the TCCHA reluctantly to let go of the
                    child saving belief that all dependent children should be separated from their families and placed
                    in so-called good homes. Consequently, by 1916 child saving by placing out had receded into a minor
                    activity. Through no intention of their own, the members of the TCCHA had become not child savers
                    but family helpers by providing the service of temporary boarding of children for needy parents; its
                    primary service became one that helped parents in a way that preserved the natural family unit. The
                    TCCHA's rhetoric in their annual reports slowly followed the reality of their services, but
                    never fully caught up. Although additional case studies of other localities are needed, this study
                    demonstrates the power to day-to-day interactions with parents and foster parents in changing one
                    organization, the TCCHA, from evangelical child savers to pragmatic family helpers. It confirms
                    Bruce Belling-ham's view that hard-pressed poor parents, rather than being passive subjects
                    of child savers' power, actually used children's institutions as a family

            <p>If I ever drive down an Indiana country road again and unexpectedly come upon a round barn, the
                    surprise will be no one's fault but my own, for John T. Hanou provides a "Catalog
                    of Round Barns" in <hi rend="i">A Round Indiana: Round Barns in the Hoosier State</hi>. In
                    it are descriptions of all 226 round (which here means anything other than four-sided) barns he
                    documented, with pictures of the 111 extant in 1992 and as many historic photographs of destroyed
                    barns as possible.</p>
            <p>The popularity of the round barn comes from two sources: first, the desire of the farmers to be
                    progressive, up-to-date, and modern and second, the sagacity of local builders who capitalized upon
                    the aforementioned aspirations. Sometimes the two reasons fed upon each other. For example, one 1903
                    advertisement claimed: <figure>

            <p>The round barn owes its genesis to the round silo. This agricultural edifice, which most people
                    probably assume has been around farms as long as farms have been around, was a nineteenth-century
                    manifestation of progress. When, in the 1880s, <placeName>

                    rectangular ones, his brother, C. E., asked him to design one of the new silos for him along with a
                    new barn. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> combined the projects in "a 90–foot-diameter round barn with his
                    all-wood circular silo positioned in the center&amp;. [This] was the first of a generation of
                    true-circular silo barns, characterized by balloon-frame construction, horizontal wood siding, and a
                    conical roof&amp;" (p. 14).</p>

                    round barn to be structurally inferior to the rectangular barn, but they built round barns because
                    of the demand for them" (p. 31).</p>
            <p>Hanou closes his narrative with a call for preservation of these barns if for no other reason than
                    "the round barn has a certain charm not found outside the <placeName>

                    visually pleasing &amp;. In short, the round barn is a masterpiece" (p. 62).</p>

            <p>Indiana quilts and quiltmakers are the subject of <hi rend="i">Quilts of Indiana: Crossroads of
                        Memories</hi>. Documenting the work of the Indiana Quilt Registry Project (IQRP) for two years,
                    this book details the IQRP-sponsored quilt registration days which found more than three thousand
                    Indiana quilts and recorded their history, often for the first time. Valuable as both fiber art and
                    historical artifacts, these quilts, together with photographs and details of their makers, take
                    their rightful place against the larger background of Indiana history.</p>
            <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-090-2-075"/>
            <p>Some special characteristics of quilts made in Indiana emerge from this colorful volume. Perhaps as a
                    result of early migration from the states of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana quiltmakers excelled at the art of applique. Of particular note is the
                    whimsical fork art work of Mary Jane Kirkpatrick Harlan (pp. 22–23) from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName>. Then there is the masterful Harrison Rose quilt by Susan McCord (pp.
                    36–37), a prolific quiltmaker whose quilts are preserved in the Henry Ford Museum.
                    Finally, there are the numerous Art Nouveau applique compositions of Marie Webster from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Marie Webster is so revered by American needleworkers that her family home is
                    being restored as a museum to the quilter's craft.</p>
            <p>Outstanding pieced quilts are likewise represented. The somber, but striking, Mariner's
                    Compass quilt made by Susan Brack-ney from <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, is a prime example of the beauty of geometric patchwork. The mint condition
                    Rolling Stone quilt, owned by the Christner family of <placeName>

               </placeName> (p. 160), glows
                    from the page. Especially stunning is Naomi Shields Sillions's Japanese Fans quilt (p.
                    132). This gem combines intricate points, tiny pieces, and curves, all the while serving as the best
                    lesson on complimentary color choice any art teacher could want. That this quilt was made by a
                    thirteen-year-old girl is both humbling and awe-inspiring.</p>

                    their subtle details.</p>
            <p>Quiltmakers, of course, will love this book, but Hoosier history buffs will also appreciate the way

            <p>A dearth of National Park Service (NPS) and National Historic Landmarks Program sites that include
                    women in an interpretation of the built environment prompted preparation of <hi rend="i">Reclaiming
                        the <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-090-2-076"/> Past</hi>. The volume's seven essays focus on
                    broad themes: architecture (Barbara J. Howe), the arts (Barbara Melosh), community (Gail Lee
                    Dubrow), education (Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz), politics (Joan HoM, religion (Jean R. Soderlund), and
                    work (Lynn Y. Weiner), in an effort to "focus attention on historic structures associated
                    with women's history and to provide the contextual framework for making judgements about
                    sites that are of national significance" (p. 21). The authors aim to "stimulate
                    increased efforts to connect women's past to tangible resources" and thereby to
                    help "Americans to get in touch with important parts of their past" (p. 23).</p>
            <p>Howe's essay points out that although women initiated the early historic preservation
                    campaigns to save buildings that interpret a broad spectrum of the American past, little note has
                    been made of their efforts. In fact, a striking feature of the entire volume is that it reveals the
                    apparent lack of concern regarding aspects of the built environment that reflect women's
                    accomplishments. In part, this is because of the endurance of prevailing male-dominated
                    interpretations of American history. As Melosh notes in her chapter on the arts, for example, women
                    have been "unjustly excluded from the canon" (p. 64). Recent scholarship and a
                    reconsideration of women's culture have promoted a greater understanding of
                    women's contributions to history. The next step is for preservation agencies like the NPS
                    to examine the relationship between physical space and the development of women's social
                    roles by considering the addition of new sites while at the same time integrating an interpretation
                    of women's history into present programs. Federal agencies may need to reevaluate
                    eligibility criteria in order to make them more inclusive of gender and class themes in
                    America's past. Another way to address the deficiency, according to Dubrow, is to integrate
                    "women's historians with this area of expertise into the preservation planning
                    process" (p. 110).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Reclaiming the Past</hi> is a well-documented overview of women's contributions
                    to the areas covered in the thematic chapters. It also surveys many structures currently used to
                    interpret that part of the country's past and suggests a multitude of other potential
                    sites. The authors make a plea for a greater understanding of the intersection between the new
                    feminist scholarship and the field of historic preservation. Therefore, the volume is of value for
                    anyone interested in women's history, historic preservation, or an increased depth to the
                    public's understanding of the American past.</p>

            <p>The chapter by Lenville J. Stelle on his excavations of the possible 1730 Fox fort at Arrowsmith in
                    northeastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> is of particular interest to this reviewer because of his own documentary research on
                    the Fox fort. The siege of this fort was one of the great Indian battles of North America. Its site
                    has been disputed for well over a century, and, as Stelle correctly points out, "the
                    location of the site is an empirical question, answerable through archaeology" (p. 274).
                    The results of Stelle's preliminary excavations, particularly of the semisubterranean
                    structures of the Arrowsmith fort, are very encouraging and so far seem to be consistent with the
                    eighteenth-century French descriptions of the Fox fort's internal structures.</p>
            <p>Stelle's report on his Arrowsmith project leaves something to be desired, however, in its
                    incomplete use of recently published documentary <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-090-2-078"/> material on
                    the fort. For example, he does not acknowledge (p. 271) the important scale given on both the Lery
                    and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>-drawn maps of the fort; he also cites the incorrectly translated dimension of the
                    prairie surrounding the fort as "four leagues in circumference" (p. 269). Further,
                    the reference for his source (p. 301) for the Dauteuil de Monceaux (or "Rkaume")
                    battle account fails to identify an author or place and date of publication. Instead he offers a
                    string of French archival series and volumes unrelated to the document in question, followed,
                    finally, by a partial identification of the actual manuscript source. The full identification and
                    location of the original and copies of this manuscript, which are in <hi rend="i">three</hi>
                    archives, are given on pages 92 and 93 of the reviewer's "The Fate of the Fox

            <p>It is remarkable that the northern soldier persevered amidst the cedar-stands of Murfreesboro and
                    along the banks of Antietam Creek. But what was it that motivated him to leave his comfortable home
                    and endure the horrors of the Civil War? What sustained the volunteer through the terrible conflict
                    and enabled him to stand loyal to the Union?</p>
            <p>Reid Mitchell addresses these and other equally important questions in this thought-provoking book. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName> has transformed a series of unconnected essays into an analysis that successfully fuses
                    military and social history. His unique approach provides a blueprint for future studies on the
                    great national tragedy that continues to capture the American imagination.</p>
            <p>The author views the war in familial terms and explores the importance of community and family values
                    in the arduous transformation of northern volunteer into northern soldier. Union armies evolved into
                    physical manifestations of such values—marching <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-090-2-079"/> and
                    fighting extensions of the northern community in which the individual volunteer was raised. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName> employs the concept of "domestic imagery" in his discussion and
                    examines a wide range of topics including discipline in volunteer armies, the relationship of white
                    officers and black soldiers, and the contrasting images of northern and southern women.</p>
            <p>In constructing his theme, the author draws upon an impressive and eclectic collection of primary
                    sources and recent ethnic, gender, and revisionist studies. This interesting bibliographical mixture
                    enhances <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s perspective on the war's participants and events. Undoubtedly, some
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s conclusions will provoke debate among scholars, particularly the sub-chapter
                    entitled "Domesticity and Confederate Defeat" (pp. 160–66). Here the
                    author discusses northern victory and southern defeat within the context of familial ideology and
                    family obligations. Despite the expected interpretational differences generated by such pioneering
                    studies as <hi rend="i">The Vacant Chair</hi>, all serious students of the Civil War will benefit
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s unusual approach.</p>
            <p>Mechanically, the writing is quite good and the index sufficient. It is surprising that the editors
                    elected not to include a bibliography, but the extensive notes compensate for this deficiency. Taken
                    altogether, this is another quality offering by an excellent publishing house.</p>
            <p>It is feared that the general public will bypass this book and concentrate upon the many fine
                    narratives of marches and battles that have appeared recently. However, those who desire a better
                    understanding of <hi rend="i">why</hi> the northern soldier left his chair vacant by the family
                    hearth and what reservoir of strength he drew upon until final victory could be achieved will profit

            <p>The Civil War may have been the first "modern" war in military terms, but in terms
                    of medical and surgical care, the conflict might just as well have been fought in the Dark Ages.
                    Roughly two-thirds of all Civil War casualties resulted from disease. Doctors reported ten million
                    cases of illness and more than four hundred thousand disease-related deaths. Military surgeons
                    operated in an era before an understanding of antitoxins, aseptic surgery, antisepsis, and <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-090-2-080"/> bacteriology. Medical personnel and the general population
                    alike were unaware of the relation between disease environments, immunity, sanitation, and insects
                    to illness. Not surprisingly, then, more than forty-four thousand Union soldiers died of diarrhea or
                    dysentery and approximately another thirty-three thousand succumbed to typhoid, typhus, or
                    typho-malarial fever. "Between disease and the Civil War soldier," medical writer
                    Peter Josyph explains, "there was not a fair fight" (p. 21).</p>
            <p>Josyph's <hi rend="i">The Wounded River</hi> is a selective edition of the correspondence of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> physician John Vance Lauderdale (1832–1931). Soon after receiving his M.D.
                    from the Medical College of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> in 1862, Lauderdale signed on as a contract surgeon with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army. In that capacity he worked aboard the hospital steamer <hi rend="i">D. A.
                    January</hi> for less than five months and treated patients for a total of only about forty days.
                    Summarizing his practice, Lauderdale remarked: "We hardly see our patients and make a poor
                    diagnosis before they are off our hands. We cant see the effect of remedies, and the most we try to
                    do is to render our patients as comfortable as possible, and promise them more thorough treatment at
                    the hospitals" (p. 133). According to Josyph, "Lauderdale's letters are
                    &amp; most significant not for what he describes, but for who he becomes, the disposition of his
                    views &amp; deriving, at times, less from what he observes than from what he does not"
                    (p. 32). After civilian service at <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s Belle-vue Hospital (1862–1864) and as a contract surgeon in <placeName>

                    </placeName> Territory (1864–18651, Lauderdale entered the regular army as assistant
                    surgeon. He earned the rank of surgeon in 1880 and continued to serve until 1896. Upon his death at
                    age ninety-nine he was the oldest officer in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Army.</p>
            <p>Josyph's edition provides limited insights into the diverse qualifications of Civil War-era
                    surgeons (no license was required to practice medicine!) and medical conditions along the
                        <geogName>Mississippi</geogName>, <geogName>Ohio</geogName>, and <geogName>Tennessee
                    Rivers</geogName>. Writing on April 21, 1862, Lauderdale remarked: "It brings a strong man
                    down to the helplessness of a child, to be a victim of war, &amp; it is only the hardy ones that
                    can bear up under such shocks" (p. 48). The following day he complained of the horrible
                    conditions aboard the <hi rend="i">D. A. January</hi>. "It is impossible,"
                    Lauderdale wrote, "to do justice to so many, crowded together as they are in every nook and
                    corner on both decks" (p. 50). At best, he and his fellow surgeons removed tissue,
                    amputated limbs, and tried to stabilize their patients' conditions. Those who survived the
                    jarring journey northward were ferried to more conventional hospitals in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Though Lauderdale's correspondence contains some primary material for medical and social
                    historians, especially on the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its aftermath, <hi rend="i">The Wounded River</hi> falls short as a documentary
                    edition. Most of Lauderdale's comments are pedestrian <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-090-2-081"/>
                    observations, at best suggesting his personal and ideological maturation, at worst seeming
                    indifferent to the plight of his patients. The edition also is marred by sloppiness, inattention to
                    detail, and numerous omissions, including an inadequate index. Josyph's introduction, for
                    example, is poorly organized and unevenly documented. He repeatedly fails to annotate essential
                    statements regarding Civil War medicine and provides excessive information on battles and other
                    peripheral issues. Unfortunately Josyph thus misses an important opportunity to use Lauderdale as a

                    </placeName>, promulgator of an 1851 black exclusion law, become the "bright radical
                    star" of 1866––the first state voluntarily to adopt black suffrage in
                    the early days of Reconstruction? The question is familiar to anyone who has tried to explain the
                    rise of the Republican party in the northern states of the Middle West (including Indiana), where
                    early antipathy to radical abolitionists coexisted with fear and loathing toward African Americans
                    and white-hot enthusiasm for a Union triumph over southern rebellion. At least since Eugene
                    Berwanger's myth-shattering 1967 work, <hi rend="i">The Frontier Against Slavery</hi>,
                    historians have struggled to explain quick reversals and the frequent side-by-side persistence of
                    virulent racism and Radical Republicanism on the middle border. Now comes Robert R. Dykstra with an
                    extraordinary and sophisticated study of a single state's experience with "black
                    freedom and white supremacy" in the four decades bracketing the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Dykstra is one of the most meticulous historians in the business —a determined quantifier,
                    patient researcher, articulate reporter, and graceful stylist—whose virtues combine to
                    make <hi rend="i">Bright Radical Star</hi> at once a model of rigorous analysis and a pleasure to
                    read. Starting with stories about the small black population in Democratic frontier <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, Dykstra introduces a growing cast of characters, confrontations, court cases,
                    political events, and social developments until, nearly two hundred pages later, readers find
                    themselves in a thoroughly Republicanized state on the eve of the Civil War, illegally funneling
                    muskets into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> and singing the praises of murderous John Brown! Deftly skipping the war itself, <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-090-2-082"/> Dykstra traces the single theme of support for black civil
                    rights through the war years and picks up political analysis in the Reconstruction period. Here,
                    with a gentle touch, he delivers most of his quantitative analysis, carefully exploring the
                    characteristics and behavior of different categories of voters until he has constructed his answer
                    to the opening question.</p>
            <p>No summary of Dykstra's nuanced argument will do it justice. Too savvy to pretend that
                    Iowans suddenly changed their racist stripes, Dykstra argues that determined Republican leaders,
                    themselves dedicated to racial equality, skillfully guided Hawkeye voters into doing the
                    "right" thing by exploiting their relatively weak attachment to racial prejudice
                    compared to other commitments. With little economic reliance on slavery or black labor, little
                    experience with racial mixing, and weak institutions of discrimination, Iowans could respond to
                    abstract appeals that contradicted visceral racism. In a fascinating final chapter, Dykstra then
                    asks whether idealistic leadership or social policy can indeed overcome racist habits, history, and
                    traditions. His answer is yes: if racist Iowans knowingly could extend the suffrage to blacks in
                    1866, then racism is not immutable. Therefore, efforts to advance the cause of racial
                    justice—late twentieth-century cynicism notwithstanding—are vindicated by this
                    historical example. Readers may not agree with Dykstra's assessment of the possibilities
                    for racial harmony, but they cannot fail to be impressed by the history behind it.</p>

            <p>At least 250 young Americans are known to have sought artistic training in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Munich</settlement>
                    </placeName> between 1870 and 1885. Even more went to the main alternative center, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although it fundamentally changed the course of American art, the nationwide movement
                    is too diffuse and too poorly documented to afford a clear picture of just how it had this powerful
                    effect. The outstanding exception to this generalization, however, is the group of Indiana artists
                    whom Martin Krause has taken as the subject of his valuable book, <hi rend="i">The Passage</hi>. He
                    focuses his study primarily on the work of three of the founders of landscape painting in Indiana,
                    Theodore Clement Steele (1849–19261, John Otis Adams (1851–19271, and William
                    Forsyth (1854–1935), who, together with other young artists, went <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-090-2-083"/> from Indiana to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Munich</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the early 1880s, returned to Indiana before the end of the decade, and continued to
                    interact and influence one another until about 1905. They make an ideal study, because their
                    experience in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Munich</settlement>
                    </placeName> is exceptionally well documented through both works of art and correspondence, and
                    because the three artists seldom painted outside the state. It remains for other studies to extend
                        <hi rend="i">The Passage's</hi> field of vision, to give proper weight to the career of
                    Otto Stark (1859–1926) and other artists who do not fit the dominant pattern of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Munich</settlement>
                    </placeName> training, and to contrast the parallel development of artistic identities in
                    neighboring <placeName>

                    </placeName>, which doubtless had a powerful effect on the perhaps not-so-isolated Indiana painters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Passage</hi> is appropriately organized into five sections of extended text, which
                    provide the historical background for the drawings and paintings discussed individually on the
                    following pages, generally in chronological order. As useful and interesting as the section
                    introductions are, the great strength of the book is in the sensitive entries that face each of the
                    116 full-color, full-page illustrations of the drawings, watercolors, and paintings by Steele,
                    Adams, and Forsyth, as well as a number of related artists, almost all dating from 1881 to 1904, the
                    period of the artists' best work. Discussing several paintings each for most of those key
                    years, Krause is able to describe, step-by-step, the evolution of the artists' styles,
                    their influences upon one another, and their pictorial exploration of their native state. The
                    carefully documented entries communicate a close knowledge of and affection for both the paintings
                    and the locations these artists perceived as beautiful.</p>

                    addition to the growing Chicano historical literature on the Midwest. The first book-length urban

                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>" and its automobile workers, whose lives are unveiled from oral histories,
                    unpublished reports, and the Henry Ford archives. Vargas portrays the complexity of the working
                    lives and the social and cultural experiences of Mexicanos who for the first time entered the
                    industrial proletariat of the nation. The work is divided into sections that examine the origins of
                    migration to the Midwest, the first wave of settlement in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1917 to 1921, the second phase of settlement from 1922 to 1933, and finally, the
                    Great Depression.</p>
            <p>Large-scale Mexican migration to the Midwest began at the outbreak of World War I, during a boom
                    period when employers quickly recruited workers to offset the curtailment of migration from Europe.
                    Mexicanos eagerly accepted the offers of work, according to Vargas, not out of economic necessity,
                    but a desire to improve their living standards and escape second-class status in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. They found a hierarchy in employment in the region, and the top of the line in the
                    1920s was the automobile industry, which typically attracted workers already in the north and
                    experienced in other occupations. Ford became the largest employer, and in the late 1920s hired more
                    Mexicanos than any other company in the nation. Most other companies hired smaller, but still
                    substantial, numbers of Mexican workers, but only Buick engaged in formal recruitment efforts. Still
                    others, like Studebaker, Packard, Maxwell, Cadillac, and Willys-Overland in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Toledo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as well as Fisher Body, excluded Mexicanos through a policy of requiring
                    naturalization papers.</p>
            <p>Life in the Mexican colonies of the region varied according to work, population density, gender
                    balance, the success of social and fraternal organizations, the church, as well as relations with
                    non-Mexicanos. In most urban locations, the culture was predominantly male and constantly in flux.
                    For women, the urban Midwest was also a complex experience. Vargas suggests that it was enriching
                    for those who could achieve a wage income, which served as a means to achieve an unprecedented
                    degree of independence from traditional controls.</p>
            <p>With the onset of the Great Depression, the dream of active participation in the American way of life
                    was at least temporarily shattered by unemployment, discrimination, and an intense racism by
                    dominant Euro-American society that singled out Mexicanos to blame for the nation's woes.
                    Repatriation upset midwestern urban colonias much more profoundly than those of the Southwest. As
                    Vargas notes, the glitter of the urban Midwest and the shallowness of the accumulationist culture of
                    the 1920s suddenly were exposed. But the Mexicanos who survived were better prepared for the next
                    round of struggle later in the decade.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Voices of American Homemakers</hi> reflects both the strengths and weaknesses of the <hi rend="i">Hoosier Homemaker</hi> series. Like the Indiana volumes, the national collection offers
                    revealing recollections of rural customs, communities, lifestyles, and values. The straightforward
                    and often eloquent words of the rural homemakers reaffirm the worth of oral history as a method for
                    recording life experiences of ordinary people. Similar to the Hoosier volumes, however, this
                    collection deals with growing up, courtship, and childbirth without providing much insight on either
                    sexual attitudes or behavior. The closest this volume comes to addressing these issues is a <placeName>

                    organization of excerpts within the topical framework. The various sections thus present a jumble of
                    reminiscences that require the reader to determine the significance of geographical and generational
                    differences with little help from the editor. Although clearly less successful than the more

            <p>The fifty-year anniversaries of World War II have sparked all manner of commemoration and memory.
                    Most have focused on those who fought the war in uniform, with some attention to such home front
                    contributors as "Rosie the Riveter." William M. Tuttle, Jr., brings an overlooked
                    group to the forefront by demonstrating how important the war was to children and how important it
                    remains in the lives of Americans who were children fifty years ago.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">"Daddy's Gone to War"</hi> ranges widely, exploring the
                    meaning of absent fathers, working mothers, latchkey children, war games, entertainment, health
                    care, school, racial conflict—all from the perspective of Americans born between 1932 and
                    1945. Tuttle builds his analysis on a mountain of primary and secondary historical sources (and
                    includes very helpful endnotes), on the scholarly literature in the social sciences, particularly
                    psychology, and on oral history interviews and letters from 2,500 Americans who responded to his
                    call for memories of the war.</p>
            <p>The strength of Tuttle's book is to bring together two issues of great
                    interest—World War II itself and the consequences and memories of it for a particular
                    generation of Americans. Tuttle shows the searing effect of the war in its red, white, and blue
                    patriotism and sacrifice, its sex-role stereotyping, and its nightmares induced by fears of death
                    and separation from fathers. For children of this generation this war lasted until long after 1945
                    because they faced the Cold War, <placeName>

                    challenges of the 1960s and beyond with World War II experiences and memories firmly in place. Some
                    home front children remained attached to a good versus evil form of patriotism of the kind displayed
                    in Frank Capra's <hi rend="i">Why We Fight</hi> series. Some in their forties and fifties
                    came to see America in terms of decline from the sacrifice and high moral purpose that they
                    identified with the early 1940s. In the 1990s they remember and commemorate the "good
                    war" partly to educate younger Americans in their version of morality and patriotism. Some
                    war children grew to adulthood to become more distrustful of authority, especially during the 1960s,
                    and changed their understanding of World War II. "We were taught," one woman later
                    recalled of her childhood war years, that "to ask questions was to show lack of patriotism.
                    What a crock" (p. 258)!</p>
            <p>In sorting out these long-term effects, Tuttle has made a significant contribution not only to
                    understanding what happened fifty years ago but to thinking about what has happened in the fifty
                    years since. <hi rend="i">"Daddy's Gone to War"</hi> brings home the
                    centrality of life cycles, generational change, and memory in American history.</p>

            <p>This well-researched volume examines the American railroad depot in social and architectural terms,
                    aspects which usually go unremarked. After differentiating between depots, which were single
                    buildings, and stations, which were a collection of structures, H. Roger Grant traces depots from
                    their beginnings as existing trackside hotels, stores, or residences to highly specialized buildings
                    developed by individual railroads for their particular needs. As its title indicates, the book deals
                    only with those depots which, in addition to being the community's transportation and
                    social center, served as living quarters for the agent and his family. This comprised about
                    one-fifth of all depots erected in the <placeName>

            <p>As rails extended westward, often preceding settlement, housing for the agent frequently developed
                    into an acute problem. Railroads solved this problem by adding a second story or, less frequently,
                    by expanding the depot at ground level. This type was concentrated most heavily in the Northern
                    Plains States, the Far West, Southwest, and Canadian <placeName>

            <p>Most railroads developed standard plans for one, two, and three bedroom units and used these
                    throughout their systems. They were spartan, many lacking water and plumbing; yet they were typical
                    of rural and frontier housing in their areas and during their time. Most were gaunt, stark
                    structures but occasionally Gothic barge-boards or Italianate brackets were seen, along with porches
                    and wide roof overhangs. A few sported attractive dormers.</p>
            <p>In addition to solving the agent's housing problem, the live-in depot discouraged burglaries
                    and provided immediate personnel in case of emergencies. It eliminated commuting, which might be
                    unreliable, and lowered insurance rates because of round-the-clock occupancy. Living in the depot,
                    however, had its disadvantages. Danger from fire, train wrecks, and even avalanches was always
                    present, and the roar of passing trains was annoying.</p>
            <p>The practice of living in the station declined rapidly after World War II because traveling agents
                    replaced many in residence, and the need for telegraph operators diminished as centralized
                    electronic dispatching expanded.</p>
            <p>The book is easy, delightful reading, suited both to the rail and the social historian. It reinforces
                    Grant's credentials as one of the nation's two or three foremost contemporary
                    scholarly rail historians.</p>

            <p>Military conscription contradicts basic American ideals of individual liberty but engenders arguments
                    for civic duty. George Q. Flynn advances a sound historical analysis that rejects polemical
                    characterizations of draftees as either citizen-soldiers or cannon fodder. He finds that both
                    proponents and opponents of the draft have exaggerated. The Selective Service System provided
                    adequate manpower to meet the nation's needs through three wars. Its failings were largely
                    political and social, which, Flynn contends, were not the fault of draft procedures themselves but
                    were the product of more fundamental tensions in American life.</p>
            <p>Flynn is the biographer of General Lewis B. Hershey, the Hoosier who headed Selective Service from
                    1941 to 1970, and Hershey figures prominently in this book. Former Indiana Governor Paul McNutt,
                    director of the War Manpower Commission during World War II, receives brief mention.
                    Hershey's system received <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-090-2-091"/> repeated endorsements from
                    presidents, Congress, and the public. He made a political mistake, however, when he approved denying
                    draft deferments to antidraft protesters during the Vietnam War. Flynn argues perceptively that this
                    move to silence dissent gave a weapon to critics that already characterized conscription as a
                    violation of civil liberties. The gradual erosion of political support for Selective Service led
                    finally to its replacement with an all-volunteer force (AVF).</p>
            <p>The book's best insights are into the national myths and dilemmas that the draft exposed. As
                    the name Selective Service revealed, not everyone was needed to serve in World War II, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName>, or <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>. Without universal service, two cherished values clashed. Faith in the efficiency of
                    scientific management decreed that it was possible to place the right person in the right job.
                    Egalitarian notions of democracy assumed that random selection was the most equitable. These
                    mutually exclusive theories plagued Selective Service's classification of registrants
                    throughout its existence. Centralized management through national rules and quotas also warred with
                    politically driven reliance on local draft boards that interpreted the rules and filled the quotas.
                    This analysis masterfully blends military, political, and social history. Finally, Flynn argues that
                    Richard Nixon politically embraced the AVF to lessen public dissatisfaction with an unpopular war.
                    Statistical profiles reveal, however, that the AVF is no more efficient or democratic than the draft
                    and that the dilemmas inherent in converting civilians to soldiers remain unresolved. If the nation
                    faces a long-term, mass deployment of troops in some future war, Flynn concludes, the effective but
                    flawed draft might well reappear.</p>

            <p>This collection of twelve essays has been edited and published to honor Martin E. Marty, called by
                        <hi rend="i">Time</hi> magazine "the most influential living interpreter of religion in
                    the US." In this volume Marty's students document the range of his interests. The
                    editors have grouped the essays under three categories: Public Religion, New Directions in American
                    Religious History, and Religious Fundamentalism. Each of the three represents a significant focus in
                    Marty's professional interests and publication record. And what a publication record he
                    has! The editors include a "Select Bibliography" <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-090-2-092"/> of publications by Marty dealing with the themes of the
                    volume—three hundred titles in all which they estimate form approximately a tenth of his
                    total bibliography—and he has not yet retired. The bibliography confirms what
                    Marty-watchers have known for a long time, namely, his range and productivity are staggering.</p>
            <p>It is rare when the essays in a festschrift collectively achieve lasting significance. This volume is

                    contributions, readers will experience a sense of disjunction as they move through the collection.

                  <country reg="-us">United
                            States</country>, <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>—and range across art history, mission history, publishing history,
                    ecumenical history, and the history of medical ethics. One might argue that this diversity
                    accurately reflects Marty's own wide ranging interests—and it does. But,
                    unfortunately, the reader's journey is not an easy one. The second group of essays is even
                    more disparate, dealing respectively with Thomsonian medicine in the nineteenth century, American
                    Catholic historiography, recent hymnody and church music, and the religious pilgrimages of three
                    twentieth-century women. The third section of essays has ostensibly the tightest integration as all
                    deal with some aspect of American fundamentalisms.</p>
            <p>Several of the articles warrant careful attention by readers. Sally M. Promey's account of
                    John Singer Sargent's murals in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library is a valuable contribution from a sub-discipline infrequently
                    contributing to the study of American religion. Catherine L. Albanese demonstrates the close
                    conjunction between Thomsonian medicine and the politics of Jacksonian America. R. Scott
                    Appleby's use of the concept of the "enclave" as a way of speaking about
                    an American Catholic fundamentalism is most instructive. In other words, these and other essays in
                    the collection have much to offer, but as is often the case with such volumes, here the whole is
                    less than the sum of its parts.</p>

            <p>David J. Bodenhamer and James W. Ely have brought together a distinguished and eclectic group of
                    historical and constitutional <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-090-2-093"/> scholars to write on the very
                    large subject of the Bill of Rights (literally the first eight or perhaps nine amendments) of the
                    Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> after two hundred years. These writers are a wide-ranging group who are at various
                    points in the current ideological spectrum regarding constitutional interpretation. The
                    editors' agenda is clearly to let the selected writers have the freedom to advocate a wide
                    variety of positions, but the agenda of the editors is also clearly to inform. This collection
                    differs somewhat in its format but compares favorably to the classic <hi rend="i">The Birth of the
                        Bill of Rights</hi>, first published in 1955 by Robert A. Rutland.</p>
            <p>Some writers choose to argue aggressively for a so-called living constitution made fashionable by
                    such justices as the recently retired William J. Brennan. Others argue for a species of judicial
                    restraint that might be pleasing to Felix Frankfurter or John Marshall Harlan II. It can be said
                    without equivocation that each of the writers did their historical homework well.</p>
            <p>It is especially courageous for Randy E. Barnett to attempt to make some sense out of the Ninth
                    Amendment of the Constitution and to frame his argument into almost Borkian original understanding
                    without wading into the current efforts to use that amendment as a basis for personal and sexual
                    privacy. In like vein, co-editor Ely argues for a renewed concern for so-called property rights.</p>
            <p>The structure of the book is especially appealing in that it puts the notes plus bibliographic essays
                    and the all-important table of cases at the end and does not clutter up the narration. Of particular
                    moment to this reviewer is the attention that is given to <hi rend="i">Barnes u. Glen Theatre</hi>,
                    better known as the Kitty Kat Lounge nude dancing case, a 1991 Supreme Court decision emanating from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, by eminent constitutional historian, Paul L. Murphy, in his insightful piece
                    on symbolic speech and the First Amendment. This case was listed along with the flag-burning case
                    and the hate speech cases which came along at the same time.</p>
            <p>The bibliographic essays, while not extended, are highly useful. When one looks at the totality of
                    these writings, the ideas and formulations advanced in one time frame by certain groups in society
                    in order to influence a particular decisional result may well in another time, and by other interest
                    groups, be taken up to achieve different results. The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> court was both praised and criticized for judicial activism and the setting aside of
                    long established precedent. It was also criticized for making value choices that should be made by
                    the elected legislative and executive branches. Those who made those criticisms in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> era often paid great homage to the democratically elected legislators and executive. In
                    current terms, one sees those who fear that some of the basic decisions of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> court are endangered making the same kinds of argument for <hi rend="i">stare
                    decisis</hi> and a new species of legal formalism. There <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-090-2-094"/> can be
                    little doubt that some of the basic seeds of so-called substantive due process were sowed as early
                    as Justice Samuel Chase's majority opinion in <hi rend="i">Calder u. Bull</hi> in 1798
                    (which germinated in the dissent of Justice Stephen Field in the Slaughterhouse cases in 1873), and
                    were given something of a decent judicial burial, at least in the economic context in 1937.
                    Likewise, ideas of judicial restraint were expressed in Justice Iredell's opinion in <hi rend="i">Calder v. Bull</hi>, as well as in the first Justice Harlan's sole dissent in
                    the 1883 Civil Rights cases. Because of its compact brevity, as well as the wide variety of opinion
                    which is proffered, along with superb bibliographic essays, this "small" book will
                    be an excellent supplemental teaching device, more than justifying the time spent by the editors and
                    the authors.</p>
