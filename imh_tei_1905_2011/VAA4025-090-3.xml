                    </placeName> farmer William Tyner's December, 1855, letter to his sister and brother-in-law
                    is an appropriate prologue for an essay on the history of rural life in Indiana. With eloquent
                    simplicity these lines disclose some pivotal characteristics of Tyner's life as an Indiana
                    farmer: the impact of environmental factors and consequent uncertainties of the harvest, labor
                    shortages that necessitated carefully calculated work sharing, and extended ordeals of sickness.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The experiences recounted in Tyner's letters illuminate rural life in

                    history from the early nineteenth to the late twentieth century.</p>
            <p>Extensive scholarship exists on midwestern land disposition policies, settlement and land ownership
                    patterns, crop production, technology of farming, commercialization of agriculture, and government
                    agricultural programs.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In addition, in the past twenty years practitioners of
                    the "new" rural history have enhanced the study of rural life by expanding their
                    focus beyond these topics. Influenced by social history models, which examine everyday lives of
                    ordinary people in connection with large-scale socioeconomic developments, and using social science
                    methodology, including quantitative analysis, the new rural historians have developed ambitious
                    agendas that call for investigating the "lifestyle and activities of farmers and villagers,
                    their family patterns, farming <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>A review of historical scholarship, both the more traditional work and recent studies in the new
                    rural history, however, reveals that Indiana is among the least studied states in the Midwest.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> As in other states, pioneering generations have attracted far more scholarly
                    and popular interest than rural Hoosiers in the late nineteenth century and in the twentieth
                        century.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Several state histories include discussions of major agricultural
                    developments within Indiana, but historians have not subjected agriculture to the rigorous attention
                    it has received elsewhere in the region.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is curious that there has not been more historical scholarship on agriculture and rural life in
                    Indiana because the state has been overwhelmingly rural for much of its history. As late as 1880
                    four-fifths of the population was rural. Even after the population balance had shifted to urban
                    areas by 1920, Indiana had a higher proportion of its population engaged in agriculture than either <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, both of which industrialized at faster rates.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Although some
                    regions of Indiana experienced rural out-migration as early as the mid-nineteenth century and only a
                    minuscule fraction of Indiana residents are engaged in agriculture today, the ideology of
                    agrarianism continues to be celebrated, and Indiana's rural past retains a strong hold on
                    the state at the conclusion of the twentieth century.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Research on rural Indiana
                    has the potential to illuminate the state's history far beyond the agrarian sector and will
                    also provide data for interesting comparisons within the Midwest. The Hoosier state is the most
                    "southern" of the midwestern states in terms of the origins of its population, and
                    it attracted proportionately fewer European immigrants in the nineteenth century. More than most
                    midwestern states, its agricultural base has been dominated by two products—corn and
                    hogs—since the early nineteenth century. The smallest of the midwestern states in square
                    miles, Indiana nonetheless encompasses considerable diversity not only in topography but also in its
                    settlement history and economic development.</p>
            <p>Although the history of rural life in Indiana requires studies of numerous topics utilizing a variety
                    of research methods, the new rural history offers perhaps the most interesting possibilities. New
                    rural historians examine a "range of settlement patterns, including villages and small
                    towns" under the rubric of "rural."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Robert P.
                    Swierenga has posited that "ruralness is more than location or an occupation; it is a way
                    of life"; but other scholars warn against emphasis on the "separateness of the
                    countryside" from socioeconomic developments within the nation and the world.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Similarly, Hal S. Barron notes that in answering questions about patterns of social
                    structure and mobility in the countryside, the nature of family life, the roles of class, race,
                    gender, and ethnicity, and the influence <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-090-3-009"/> of ideology and <hi rend="i">mentalité</hi>, new rural historians will be able to expand knowledge of the
                    countryside and of American society as a whole. "From this perspective," Barron
                    states, "the crucial experiences in the agrarian past are not just the processes of
                    settlement and the economic and technological development of agriculture. Rather, it is equally
                    important to look at the social and political relationships that tied the countryside to the great
                    transformation of nineteenth-century America into an urban-industrial society."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Until the 1980s rural northerners like William Tyner were part of what Barron terms "a kind
                    of historiographical ‘silent majority."’<hi rend="sup">13</hi> While
                    social historians during the 1960s and 1970s concentrated on the colonial era, urbanization and
                    industrialization in the North, and the institution of slavery in the South, the social history of
                    rural life in the North languished. The publication of some innovative social histories of rural
                    life in recent years, however, marked the end of this scholarly drought, at least for some
                    northeastern and midwestern states. Unlike agricultural historians whose works are essentially
                    devoid of the men, women, and children who inhabited rural areas, these scholars and several others
                    have not only given life to rural inhabitants but have also situated their experiences within the
                    context of their families, communities, regions, and nation.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Most of the new
                    rural history research, however, like much of the work in social history, focuses primarily on the
                    nineteenth century; rural life in the twentieth-century Midwest has received less attention by
                        historians.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>John Mack Faragher's <hi rend="i">Sugar Creek: Life on the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                            <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> offers a model of the detailed local study of rural life that needs to be
                    written for different rural Indiana communities. Through careful examination of land office records,
                    genealogies, and census manuscripts, Faragher traces the pivotal role of kinship groups in settling
                    the <geogName>Sugar Creek Valley</geogName> area in central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Relatives joined settled families, children of these families intermarried, and these
                    families and households formed "the essential social building blocks" of community
                    in Sugar Creek.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Prior to 1850 land was fairly evenly distributed among
                    residents who evolved a pattern of community self-sufficiency based on "exchanges of labor,
                    products, and tools," all outside the market. Commercial farming did not evolve
                    "until the agricultural revolution of the late 1850s, the 1860s and beyond, when farms were
                    converted, in economic terms, into units of capital."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Traditional
                    ways of thinking and acting persisted even as economic development progressed: the most successful
                    continued to believe that the best investment was additional land. At the same time class
                    distinctions became more evident as the gap widened between the large landowning families and the
                    landless farmers who worked for them.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faragher's study of Sugar Creek is based on an impressive number and variety of sources, a
                    tribute to his skills as a researcher <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-090-3-010"/> and a reflection of the
                    richness of materials on that particular region of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Local studies present scholars with imposing methodological problems, the most
                    significant of which is the availability of sources. Reminiscences and memoirs contain some
                    interesting anecdotes but often tend to be vague and nostalgic. Letters, diaries, and account books
                    are more useful in furnishing details of daily life although they reflect primarily the experiences
                    of the community elite. Furthermore, the availability of manuscript sources for different counties
                    within Indiana varies considerably. Court records, population and agricultural censuses, and the
                    quantitative studies by the Purdue University Agricultural Experiment Station cover the entire state
                    and furnish crucial data essential for undertaking new rural histories of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> In Indiana, as in other states, the settlement era has generated a substantial corpus of
                    "hardy pioneer" literature.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> This genre celebrates
                    individualism in conquering the wilderness but also addresses the creation of communities and
                    institutions. Along with county histories and genealogies these early works furnish information on
                    founding families and early institutions and also reveal something of the values of the community
                    elite. Tracking the progeny of early settlers in specific rural communities through succeeding
                    census years and land records offers one method of determining whether or not certain families
                    succeeded in passing on their land and influence to later generations. Painstaking thoroughness is
                    required to locate, sift through, analyze, and assemble the data for local studies. Most daunting
                    perhaps is the necessity for historians of rural life in Indiana to link their local studies to the
                    major issues identified by new rural historians, in particular the socioeconomic transformations
                    that affected the entire country in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p>
            <p>Studies of rural life in Indiana informed by the methods and goals of the new rural history will
                    logically build on the scholarship on the settlement of the state. This work provides a crucial
                    foundation for understanding many of the regional variations within the state, differences that
                    often render sweeping statewide generalizations invalid. Historians have long noted the existence of
                    distinctive regions within the state, differences based not only on soil quality and topography but
                    also on variations in settlers' origins, settlement patterns, and the nature of market
                        opportunities.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> These distinctions merit review because they were
                    underscored by later developments and reverberate into the late twentieth century.</p>

                    of its similarity to the hilly and heavily forested regions they had left behind. These woodland
                    farmers, who engaged initially in subsistence agriculture, followed the branches of the

            <p>Many of the early settlers in southern and central Indiana were squatters, some of whom obtained
                    preemptive rights to the lands they had improved. When reforms in land policies decreased minimum
                    purchases and prices and made it possible for more individuals to become landowners, squatters then
                    either obtained clear titles or sold their improvements.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Ultimately, the grid

                    by straight roads with a north/south and east/west orientation, with bisecting crossroads every six
                    miles that promoted the growth of small regularly spaced farms and farming communities."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> In the newly opened regions of central Indiana, "few purchases

            <p>Not until the 1830s and 1840s did settlement begin in most of northern Indiana because Indians
                    remained in the area, it was initially more difficult to reach, and the prairie counties of the

                    critical backdrop for the exploration of rural life in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Since agricultural pursuits dominated Indiana rural communities throughout the nineteenth and early
                    twentieth centuries, developments in agriculture remain essential components of the study of rural
                    life in the Hoosier state. Given variations in topography and settlement patterns, it is not
                    surprising that agricultural advancements in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were not uniform
                    throughout Indiana and in fact reinforced earlier distinctions within the state. Examinations of
                    these differences within Indiana are essential because scholars' efforts to understand the
                    role of agriculture in the capitalist transformation of the nineteenth century and the steadily
                    decreasing proportion of Americans engaged in agriculture in the twentieth century require local
                    studies in all parts of the country as well as aggregate data on national and regional economic
                    trends. Through the accumulation of case studies, state and regional syntheses can be developed and
                    comparative studies undertaken.</p>

            <p>The broad outlines of economic transitions in agriculture include the shift from subsistence to
                    commercial agriculture, changing modes of transportation, farm mechanization, the development of
                    scientific agriculture, increased productivity, and rural outmigration. The specifics of the story
                    are much less straightforward and have led to lively debates among scholars. Acknowledging that
                    interpretations differ, Steven Hahn nonetheless concludes that the evidence "suggests that
                    farm families in a variety of geographical settings well into the nineteenth century relied upon
                    their own labor, looked to household subsistence before marketing ‘surpluses,’
                    and were reluctant to embrace improved methods of tillage and animal husbandry."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Historian Clarence Danhof in <hi rend="i">Change in Agriculture: The Northern <placeName>

                            point of view of money income maximization. The latter kind of farming required that full
                            utilization be made of any advantageous factors in determining production plans, and that a
                            rationalized approach to their execution be adopted, including alertness in the appraisal
                            and application of new methods and equipment. The appearance of opportunities did not always
                            and immediately elicit a sensitivity to market considerations or the application of a

                    would never be adopted by all farmers, but during the second half of the nineteenth century it
                    became dominant. The problem for historians, according to Hahn, is "to analyze and
                    comprehend the dynamics of this transformation—to analyze and comprehend how farm
                    households were invaded and conquered by the logic and relations of commodity
                        production."<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Further complicating the historical study of the
                    capitalist transformation of agriculture is the inclusion of gender in the analysis. As Nancy Grey
                    Osterud points out, historians must investigate the "relationship between the gender
                    division of labor and distinctions between market-oriented and non-market-oriented
                    production"—whether women's work was "devalued relative to
                    men, through transition to capitalism"—and must examine the "ways in
                    which rural women and men conducted and thought about the relations of cooperation and exchange
                    between household."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Since assessments of the dynamics of the
                    capitalist transformation of agriculture have yielded so many conflicting interpretations, studies
                    of various localities in Indiana will clarify diversity within the state and provide Hoosier data
                    for the debates about the complex national processes of agricultural change and capitalist
                    transformation.</p>
            <p>Historians often cite William C. Latta's <hi rend="i">Outline History of Indiana
                    Agriculture</hi> as the source for comments on agricultural transformation within the state. Latta
                    asserted that "by 1860, the <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-090-3-015"/> self-sufficing period of
                    Indiana agriculture was practically closed and the commercial period fully ushered in."<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Latta's conclusions leave little room for statewide variations and
                    contradict Danhof s and Hahn's cautious conclusions about the speed, ease, and uniformity
                    of the transition to market agriculture, but his interpretation conforms to that offered by Douglass
                    C. North in his standard <hi rend="i">The Economic Growth of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>, 1790–1860</hi>. North notes that the "shift from pioneer
                    self-sufficiency to a market oriented agriculture took place throughout most of the western
                    states" in the years from 1815 to 1860.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indiana can serve as an interesting case study in this debate over the timing and nature of the
                    transformation of agriculture. For example, although Latta's statement implies that
                    subsistence and market agriculture were mutually exclusive modes of production, they probably
                    coexisted within many Hoosier communities. Individual farmers were unlikely to follow a linear path
                    from subsistence to market agriculture given their lack of control over environmental factors and
                    the instability of markets for their goods. Furthermore, if individual farm families were not
                    self-sufficient, varieties of community-level self-sufficiency may have persisted, especially when
                    wild price fluctuations made participation in commercial markets a sporadic economic affair for many
                    nineteenth-century farmers.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Records of extensive trade and labor sharing
                    within neighborhoods, often on a noncash basis, appear in nineteenth-century diaries and account
                    books of Indiana farmers. Many survived because they "swoped" work like William
                    Tyner and his neighbors. How did Indiana farm families determine proportions of goods for the market
                    and for household consumption? Is there evidence of resistance to change in these Indiana
                    communities? What forms did resistance take? What factors were most influential in pushing farmers
                    to enter the market economy? Topographical differences in farming regions must not be the only
                    factors considered in assessing variations between rural communities. How important were such
                    factors as commodities grown, accessibility of markets, socio-economic status, educational level,
                    and ethnicity in families' shifts to commercial agriculture? How did Indiana farmers
                    conceptualize "the market"—in regional, national, or international
                    terms—and how did their conceptualizations change over time?</p>
            <p>Historians will undoubtedly find differences between farm families within rural neighborhoods as well
                    as variations based on socioeconomic distinctions within counties, but despite this localized
                    diversity patterns characteristic of the major regions of the state should emerge. For example, less
                    productive farms in southern Indiana persisted in various permutations of subsistence agriculture
                    well into the twentieth century.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> On the other hand there is little evidence to
                    suggest that self-sufficiency existed at all in portions of northern Indiana as a result of the

            <p>Changing modes of transportation affected rural development and intensified regional differences
                    because the benefits of improved methods of transportation were not distributed equally throughout
                    the state. Developments in transportation during the nineteenth century, in addition to less fertile
                    soil and hilly terrain that inhibited mechanization, combined to make agriculture in southern
                    Indiana less prosperous than in northern or central Indiana. Hoosier farmers initially relied on
                    rivers for transporting their products south to the <placeName>

                    and by the end of the 1840s the first rail tracks had been laid in the state. In the succeeding
                    decades a rail network within the state connected many Hoosier farmers with regional and national
                    markets for their goods. Since the National Road ran through central Indiana and the rail network
                    largely bypassed southern Indiana, farmers in this area continued to rely on "slower, less
                    versatile waterways for transport."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Studies of rural life in Indiana

                    endeavors affect farm families in the open country and village residents? It is also vital that
                    historians assess the effects of transportation developments on rural life in the twentieth century.
                    Studies of rural life should explore the changes brought by the automobile to open country
                    neighborhoods and rural communities. The impact of motorized vehicles on the marketing of farm
                    products and the increased accessibility of off-farm employment are only two of many issues to
                    consider.</p>
            <p>Technological advances in farm and farmhouse equipment have had repercussions on Indiana agriculture
                    and rural life that correspond in magnitude to those involving transportation. The Civil War spurred
                    railroad building in Indiana and "accentuated the trend toward mechanization by bringing
                    about both an increased demand for farm products and a shortage of man power." Although
                    "pioneer methods of planting and cultivation and harvesting were still generally
                    prevalent" throughout the Hooser state at midcentu-ry, the following decades witnessed an
                    extraordinary expansion in agricultural mechanization.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Historians John D.
                    Barnhart and Donald F. Carmony noted that prior to 1860 Indiana farmers "used only a few
                    simple, crude implements which were pulled by horses <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-090-3-019"/> and
                    oxen—such as plows, carts, sleds, and harrows—and relied principally upon the
                    labor of men and boys with axes, hoes, forks, spades, and other tools."<hi rend="sup">53</hi> By the 1860s some farmers were using iron plows, reapers, mowers, wheat drills,
                    cultivators, corn planters, and threshers.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Indiana farmers'
                    investments in farm machinery more than quadrupled from 1850 to the turn of the century, and this
                    mechanization made possible the cultivation of three times as much land in 1900 as in 1850.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although such figures are impressive, they reveal little about differences between regions of the
                    state or the ways in which individual farmers, families, and communities were affected by new
                    technologies. The uneven diffusion of agricultural technology accentuated differences within the
                    state and also created new distinctions within communities. Not surprisingly, new farm technologies
                    had least impact in southern Indiana, where topography made the adoption of new methods more
                    difficult. Technological advancements, regardless of attitudes or economic constraints, were simply
                    "unsuitable for use in the hillier regions" of southern Indiana.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> During the first half of the twentieth century when gasoline-powered tractors and combines
                    brought further changes in Indiana agriculture, disparities in the diffusion of new agricultural

                    agricultural machinery in the twentieth century heightened distinctions between regions, with
                    southern Indiana continuing to lag behind the rest of the state. The cost and scale of machinery
                    also widened the economic gap between farmers within the same communities. Small and medium-sized
                    farms, not only in southern Indiana but throughout the state, had insufficient output to generate
                    the capital necessary to purchase new equipment.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brief overview of agricultural mechanization raises many questions about rural life in Indiana
                    from 1850 to the mid-twentieth century. Is it possible to isolate characteristics of those farmers
                    who were the first to experiment with new technologies? Who were the modernizers or innovators and
                    who were the traditionalists? What kinds of risks were the innovators assuming? Were they among the
                    wealthiest in their communities? Were landowners with several tenants more or less likely to
                    mechanize with their available labor source? How were the work lives and routines of farmers changed
                    by new farm technologies? What kinds of factors did families weigh in decisions to invest in farm
                    machinery? How did differences in rates of technological diffusion contribute to economic
                    disparities between regions and differences in rural lifestyles?</p>

                    assessment of the intersection of technological change and rural work cultures. He analyzes the
                    effects of technological transformation on both the men who threshed the wheat and the women who
                    prepared their meals. By revealing how crucial it is to consider the impact of new machinery and
                    processes on work cultures and gender roles, this important work suggests the limitations of studies
                    that look only at the economic implications of technological changes in farming.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any examination of rural life, particularly in the twentieth century, should explore the impact of
                    domestic technological change on rural farm and nonfarm families.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> During the
                    first decades of the twentieth century rural Hoosiers, like their counterparts in other states,
                    lagged far behind town and city residents in acquiring household improvements. Automobiles, which,
                    as previously noted, had an enormous impact on rural life, made access to town easier and at the
                    same time made differences in lifestyles more apparent.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Electricity and indoor
                    plumbing had transformed urban middle-class homes, but even many of the more prosperous rural
                    families remained without these amenities well into the twentieth century.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> By
                    1940 just over half of all farm families in Indiana had electricity compared with 98 percent of the
                    urban homes.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> Rural telephone service in Indiana actually got worse during the
                    1930s and 1940s as lines and poles decayed and were not replaced.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Post-World
                    War II prosperity, increased expenditures under the Rural Electrification Administration, and
                    improved roads narrowed the technological gap between rural and urban residents; but many questions
                    can be raised about the uneven diffusion of household technology prior to this time. Did the
                    acquisition of new technologies affect the quality of life in rural Indiana? Was the decrease in
                    physically burdensome chores offset by new tasks and higher expectations? What kinds of choices were
                    made by families in determining when and which new technologies to purchase for their farms and
                    homes?</p>
            <p>Many changes in farming practices and rural life in nineteenth-and twentieth-century Indiana can also
                    be linked to the explosion of agricultural information and organizations and to policies and
                    initiatives undertaken by the federal government and Purdue University. Organizational and
                    institutional histories, as well as evaluations of governmental policies and their repercussions in
                    Indiana, represent additional research areas that are relevant to understanding rural life in the
                    Hoosier state. In the last half of the nineteenth century, information on crops, livestock care and
                    breeding, and farming methods proliferated. This data appeared in newspapers and general farm
                    periodicals and in the publications of the State Board of Agriculture, farm organizations, and the
                    School of Agriculture at Purdue University.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> The State Board of Agriculture,
                        <pb n="219" id="VAA4025-090-3-023"/> created by the legislature in 1851, held the first state
                    fair in 1852. County agricultural societies, which reported to the state board and organized county
                    fairs, were also established by the legislature. State and county fairs offered recreation and
                    information with exhibits of livestock, agricultural products, and the latest farm machinery.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> In addition to countless specialized agricultural groups such as the Indiana
                    Corn Growers Association, the Indiana Live Stock Breeders' Association, and the Indiana
                    State Dairy Association, farmers also formed fraternal organizations, the most important of which
                    was the Grange or the Patrons of Husbandry. First organized in Indiana in 1869, the Grange had its
                    highest membership of over sixty thousand in the mid-1870s. The organization promoted social and
                    educational activities and cooperative buying of farm equipment.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> The first
                    Indiana "farm bureaus" appeared in communities in 1912; by 1919 these and a
                    variety of "Better Farming Associations" had created the Indiana Farm Bureau to
                    protect and promote the interests of farmers.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> The Indiana Farm Bureau
                    ultimately became the most important agricultural organization in Indiana and at various times has

                    farmers was the county agent system. Four counties already had agents when in 1913 the Indiana
                    General Assembly passed legislation that provided support for agents from state and local taxes and
                    placed the program under the direction of Purdue.<hi rend="sup">71</hi>

            <p>The following year, the Smith-Lever Act authorized federal funding for agricultural extension work in
                    connection with the land grant schools of agriculture "in order to aid in diffusing among
                    the people of the <placeName>

                        economics."<hi rend="sup">72</hi> The Smith-Lever Act and the attention directed at
                    agriculture and rural life in the early twentieth century were in part manifestations of the Country
                    Life Movement, a coalescence of broad-ranging interests within the mainstream of progressive reform
                    that focused on the problems of rural life.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> Much of the impetus for the
                    movement came from urban interests worried about the number of people leaving the countryside and
                    concerned about the maintenance of an abundant and cheap food supply. Some rural residents found
                    much of the Country Life Movement's critique of their lives offensive and condescending.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> Whatever the motivation and reception, Smith-Lever funds expanded extension
                    work in Indiana and throughout the nation.<hi rend="sup">75</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The county agents, mainly graduates of Purdue, had broad mandates that included cooperating with
                    various farmers' and youth groups, conducting demonstrations, advising farmers, and
                    promoting agriculture and home economics education. During the 1930s county agents were given
                    additional responsibilities for explaining New Deal programs to farmers.<hi rend="sup">76</hi>
                    Federal monies provided by the Smith-Lever Act also made possible the employment of county home
                    economics agents, but their numbers lagged far behind those of the county agents. In many counties,
                    in fact, the regular agents handled the home economics work. Even without demonstration agents women
                    in counties throughout the state formed their own "home ec" clubs as forums to
                    receive lessons in homemaking and to promote friendship.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> Regional variations,
                    however, must again be considered in assessing the impact of the county agents and home
                    demonstration agents. Proportionately fewer of the poorer counties in southern Indiana secured

            <p>As with all "advice" literature, caution must be used in determining the actual
                    influence of all the exhortations directed at rural residents. Whether they wrote in popular
                    agricultural journals or in mimeographed demonstration lessons, various "experts"
                    propounding certain agricultural methods or homemaking techniques furnish historians with
                    information on their goals and expectations, not on actual farming and housekeeping procedures.
                    Simply having access to the information does not mean that rural Hoosiers put it into practice. Many
                    Hoosier farmers were not just skeptical about but hostile to "book" farming. To
                    what extent are regional distinctions apparent in the successes and failures of the various
                    "experts" and their programs? Which farm men and women within communities were
                    most receptive and which were most hostile to suggestions in different publications and to the
                    extension agents and their messages about new methods in agriculture and home-making? Are class,
                    ethnic, and racial differences apparent in reactions to new methods and organizations? Is there
                    evidence of community consensus in reactions to experts?</p>
            <p>As some of the previous questions indicate, the concept of "community" is one that
                    must be clarified in any local study. Historians and sociologists have developed several useful
                    models for exploring <pb n="224" id="VAA4025-090-3-028"/> the meaning of
                        "cornmunity."<hi rend="sup">79</hi> Two interesting constructs are
                    Faragher's conclusion that dispersed open-country settlements "demonstrated
                    communal patterns usually attributed to nucleated villages alone" and the early rural
                    sociologist Dwight Sanderson's definition of community as the "corporate state of
                    mind of those living in a local area, giving rise to their collective behavior. There cannot be a
                    true community unless people think and act together."<hi rend="sup">80</hi>
                    Faragher's and Sanderson's models suggest a number of questions about rural
                    Indiana communities. What were the physical boundaries of community observed in the open country?
                    What role did networks of kin play in the creation and duration of communities? Is there evidence of
                    exclusivity in deciding who "belonged" in the community? Determining patterns of
                    social visiting and reciprocity in the sharing of materials and labor is another important factor in
                    the historical reconstruction of rural communities.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The creation and evolution of local political, religious, and educational institutions provide
                    insight into community values in rural Indiana. Analysis of the qualifications for political
                    participation, voting patterns, and local political leaders will also clarify both the nature of
                    community values and the role of persistent families in rural communities. Kenneth J.
                    Winkle's impressive study of antebellum pollbooks in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> revealed that a majority of voters cast their ballots only once or twice in an area
                    before moving on but that a "core community" of between 5 to 10 percent
                    participated in several elections. According to Winkle, these individuals "represented a
                    persistent political and economic elite" and "used their persistence to win
                    exaggerated influence both at the ballot box and in political office."<hi rend="sup">82</hi> It would be interesting to determine whether or not persistent families in Indiana
                    communities exercised the same disproportionate degree of influence in politics and over the
                    formation and operation of community institutions as those in Winkle's <placeName>

                    </placeName> study. Questions about how rural Hoosiers perceived politics and the nature of their
                    political participation should be incorporated into any local study.</p>
            <p>Social historians in general have not paid enough attention to religion, a fact that is also true for
                    the new rural history. Records of rural churches contain an abundance of information on community
                    values and networks of relationships.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> They also provide information on lay
                    leaders and conflicts within congregations. Early twentieth century rural surveys undertaken by
                    national churches lamented the decline in rural church membership and the intense competition that
                    existed between different congregations within very small population areas. James H.
                    Madison's study of rural church reform efforts from 1900 to 1950 establishes that while
                    reformers considered over-churching because of denominational rivalries the most serious obstacle to
                    reform, these individuals "did not show an understanding of the rural congregation itself

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s study suggests, many questions remain about the role of religious
                    institutions within particular communities.<hi rend="sup">85</hi> What factors within a community
                    account for the success of a particular church? Was this success related to doctrine, the role of
                    early circuit riders and later ministers, revivals, social and economic distinctions, or ethnicity?
                    What roles did women play in the religious lives of their communities? Examining religious
                    activities in rural Indiana will enhance historical understanding of changing patterns of rural
                    behavior and values.</p>
            <p>Explorations of the origins of rural schools in the nineteenth century and their development over
                    time are essential in understanding rural life. When were schools initially created and how long
                    were their sessions? What kinds of conflicts evolved over the funding and operation of rural schools
                    in different communities? To what extent did the school term conform to the dictates of farm labor?
                    What choices did families make in sending their children to school or keeping them home to work on
                    the farm? Were decisions influenced by the gender of children, and did fathers and mothers differ in
                    the values they attached to education?<hi rend="sup">86</hi> What role did teachers play in the
                    community, and what was their status? When did compulsory school attendance laws actually have an
                    effect on rural communities in Indiana?<hi rend="sup">87</hi> Any examination of rural education in
                    Indiana will have to come to terms with the debates over control of local schools, the evolution of
                    the township system, and the role of township trustees.<hi rend="sup">88</hi>
            </p>
            <p>School consolidation is an issue of critical importance in the rural Midwest in the twentieth century
                    because it has meant that countless rural communities have faced mergers with historic rivals and
                    losses of local school identities. During the 1920s the John D. Rockefeller-funded General Education
                    Board launched projects in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">LaGrange</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> counties in Indiana to demonstrate the advantages of consolidated schools financed and
                    professionally run at the county rather than the township or district level. James H.
                    Madison's study of these efforts demonstrates the degree of rural opposition to loss of
                    local control. Despite the fact that the project directors concluded that consolidation was more
                    economical and efficient, township trustees offered strong opposition. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> explains, "These local institutions traditionally belonged immediately and
                    fully to the people in an organic and even personal way. The township trustee was the local
                    government, and he was in fact the trustee of the schools, holding them in trust for the people who
                    elected him." Trustee opposition, <placeName>

                    </placeName> asserts, was not simply "narrow-minded stubbornness" and
                    "self-interest"; it reflected the local determination that "strangers

                    Johnson, LaGrange, and most of Indiana's other ninety-two counties have county-wide school
                    corporations, and not yet have the differences reflected in the debates of the 1920s been fully
                        resolved."<hi rend="sup">89</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the impact of school consolidation is undoubtedly one of the most important issues to
                    consider in examining changes in rural life in the twentieth century, several other broad themes in
                    twentieth-century history also had enormous repercussions on the lives of rural Hoosiers. Studies of
                    rural life in twentieth-century Indiana must assess the impacts of World War I and World War 11, the
                    Great Depression, and various policies of the federal government directed at the agricultural
                    sector. Statistics indicate that Hoosier farmers, like their counterparts in other midwestern
                    states, expanded production and experienced sharply rising prices during World War I but suffered
                    through lower prices in the 1920s. The early 1930s witnessed another sharp drop in prices for farm
                    produce and also saw a decrease in job opportunities off the farm. One particularly interesting
                    Depression-era phenomenon in Indiana was the "Back-to-the-Land Movement in which rural
                    migrants to towns and cities returned to their rural counties in an effort to <figure>

                    economically depressed rural areas in southern Indiana, they exacerbated the already difficult
                    conditions in these counties.<hi rend="sup">90</hi> The implementation of the New Deal Agricultural
                    Adjustment Act (AAA), which sought to deal with overproduction by paying farmers to cut back
                    production of certain staple crops, did little for landless and small farmers, especially in
                    southern Indiana. Reflecting the continued domination of corn and hogs in Indiana, a comparable
                    proportion of subsidies in Indiana was paid to producers in these two areas, and as in other states,
                    the largest producers were the primary beneficiaries. Consideration of local case studies will aid
                    historians' understanding of the effects of the New Deal on rural life, not only in terms
                    of the AAA but in connection with jobs provided for rural residents through the Civilian
                    Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration. Certainly the Rural Electrification
                    Administration had an extraordinary impact on rural life in Indiana during the 1930s and 1940s.
                    World War II had contradictory outcomes for rural Hoosiers. It promoted agricultural recovery
                    through the increased demand for agricultural products and workers; but more importantly, through
                    the creation of new jobs in war-related industries, it made more off-farm employment available for
                    rural Hoosiers and ultimately speeded the exodus from Hoosier farms. Perhaps the most important
                    theme of the past forty years has been the steadily decreasing proportion of the Indiana population
                    on farms and in rural areas, a trend that began in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>As early as 1850 rural Indiana had become more important as a source than as a destination for
                    migrants. This was particularly true for the oldest settled region of the state, southern Indiana.
                    Mid-nineteenth-century outmigration involved individuals seeking what they perceived as better
                    agricultural opportunities further west, but increasingly, rural outmigration in Indiana, and other
                    states, reflected improved agricultural efficiency during the second half of the nineteenth
                        century.<hi rend="sup">91</hi> In Indiana 52.2 percent of the workforce was engaged in
                    agriculture in 1880; in 1900, 38.1 percent; and by 1920, 26.3 percent.<hi rend="sup">92</hi> The
                    dominant trend, particularly in the twentieth century, has been toward fewer but larger farms.<hi rend="sup">93</hi> These changes are mirrored in other population figures. In 1850 only 4.5
                    percent of the Indiana population was urban (defined as living in a city over 2,500); in 1880 the
                    figure was still below 20 percent; but by 1950 almost 60 percent of the population was so
                        designated.<hi rend="sup">94</hi> Not only had the urban population grown from one-fifth to
                    three-fifths in the seventy years from 1880 to 1950 but the nonfarm rural population had also grown
                    larger than the farm population. In addition, increasing numbers of families that continued to farm,
                    particularly those with smaller farms, supplemented their farm incomes with off-farm employment, by
                    women as well as men. By <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-090-3-033"/> 1950 the total nonfarm rural
                    population was 909,874, and the total farm population was 667, 154.<hi rend="sup">95</hi> In the
                    next forty years the farm population fell to 188,133, and the nonfarm rural population rose to
                    1,760,009. By 1990 only 9.66 percent of rural Hoosiers lived on farms, which represented a scant
                    3.39 percent of the total population.<hi rend="sup">96</hi> The repercussions for rural communities
                    of the population shifts away from farming and away from rural areas in both the nineteenth and
                    twentieth centuries require careful historical investigation.<hi rend="sup">97</hi> Economists,
                    sociologists, and anthropologists have undertaken most of the research on the continuing exodus from
                    farming and the economic strategies employed by farm families, but historians examining social and
                    economic processes over time have much to add to an interdisciplinary dialogue about agrarian-ism,
                    farming, and rural life in the late twentieth century.<hi rend="sup">98</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, as several earlier questions and comments have indicated, explorations of rural life and
                    agricultural developments in Indiana during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries should include
                    the variables of race, ethnicity, and gender.<hi rend="sup">99</hi> In 1850 less than 6 percent of
                    the state's population was foreign-born, and blacks made up only 1.14 percent of the total
                    population. By 1900 5.6 percent of the state's population was foreign-born, and blacks
                    accounted for 2.29 percent of the population. In 1920 blacks still accounted for only 3 percent of
                    the population, and the percentage of foreign-born had dropped to 5. Indiana was the "least
                    ethnically diverse" state in the Old Northwest.<hi rend="sup">100</hi> Within Indiana in
                    the nineteenth century both blacks and foreign-born were more likely to be urban than rural
                    residents, a pattern that persisted throughout the twentieth century.<hi rend="sup">101</hi>
                    Immigrants and blacks, although obviously not a large proportion of the rural Indiana population,
                    nonetheless merit attention because they lived and raised families in rural areas, worked as farmers
                    and farm laborers, and settled in clusters in some rural communities.<hi rend="sup">102</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Kathleen Neils Conzen points out that immigrant experiences have not received much attention in rural
                    sociology and agricultural history. She reminds those writing the new rural history that
                    "the lively debate &amp; over agrarian complicity in capitalist transformation

                    Conzen asks if Old World customs survived and influenced lifestyles and farming methods and further
                    notes that if "immigrant values could shape a distinctive rural way of life, the same
                    freedom must have existed for their native-born counterparts."<hi rend="sup">103</hi>
                    Studies of rural Indiana might thus explore the connections between race and ethnicity and
                    differences and similarities with natives in farming methods, investment strategies, and retention
                    of land within families.<hi rend="sup">104</hi> As conflicting interpretations of the Ku Klux Klan

            <p>Historical research on rural women, although still predominantly on white European-American women,
                    challenges the applicability of the urban-based paradigm of separate spheres for understanding the
                    historical experiences of women who were part of family-based agricultural production units in the
                    nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<hi rend="sup">106</hi> It also calls into question
                    explanations of the development of market-oriented agriculture that are oblivious to gender
                    differences in farm families' adaptations to commercial agriculture. Recent scholarship on
                    rural women has revealed interesting variations in work patterns.<hi rend="sup">107</hi> This
                    research suggests that on wheat- and corn-producing farms on the prairies and Great Plains, work was
                    clearly gender-defined, and women had at best marginal roles in connection with the commercial
                    crops; but on dairy farms in the East and upper Midwest, scholars have found that there was more
                    work sharing and that women had critical roles in the farming operation.<hi rend="sup">108</hi>
                    Since it seems possible that both patterns existed in Indiana, it is worth summarizing some of the
                    most important conclusions of this research.</p>

            <p>Researchers on dairy operations in both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, while acknowledging
                    that the farm with its "patriarchal legal restrictions, offered women little ultimate
                    control over their wealth, property, or even their labor," have reached more positive
                    conclusions about the experiences of rural women. Joan Jensen, in <hi rend="i">Loosening the Bonds:
                        Mid-Atlantic Farm Women, 1750–1850</hi>, describes the personal satisfaction and
                    societal esteem women derived from the development of the women-centered butter-making industry in
                    the <geogName>Brandywine Valley</geogName> of southeastern <placeName>

                    provided a firm foundation for the market production of the farms," she notes.
                    "They provided <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-090-3-035"/> most of the uninstitutionalized welfare
                    for the rural population and organized their own labor into efficient farm units, both as managers
                    and as a work force." Jensen observes that "most countrywomen found satisfaction
                    and comfort in their rural lives" and concluded that they had "loosened the bonds
                    of the traditional rural family in small but significant ways; it was reduced in size, less subject
                    to male control, and modified by female experimentation and productivity."<hi rend="sup">110</hi> Nancy Grey Osterud's study of nineteenth-century rural women in the

                    </placeName> is even more explicit in challenging the patriarchal oppression and inequality of farm
                    women. Again recognizing that "inequality was still deeply embedded in women's and
                    men's relationships to the land," Osterud nonetheless asserts that the lives of
                    her rural women "directly contradicted the prescriptions of separate spheres" and
                    represented a rejection of "the terms of the dominant ideology." Their involvement
                    in dairying and the centrality of this work to the economy "ensured that at least this form
                    of women's work was recognized and valued by men." Osterud believes that the
                    mutual work of men and women on the farm and the importance of the kinship network "helped
                    to mitigate the hierarchical nature of property and authority relations between men and
                    women." Women expanded "existing areas of commonality" and constructed
                    "new modes of sharing between women and men. In struggling to improve their own lives women
                    enhanced the quality of life for men as well."<hi rend="sup">111</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, Mary Neth in her work on rural women in early twentieth-century <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> dairy farming concludes that the exchange and trade of the products of women's
                    labor was "central to building the consistent patterns of resource and labor sharing within
                    rural neighborhoods." Like Osterud, Neth reiterates the importance of kinship ties in rural
                    communities. "Rather than being sharply defined by a separate sphere of gender,
                    women's identity encompassed their roles as women, as family members, and as friends and
                    neighbors in the rural community. While women's work was sometimes gender-defined, it was
                    not segregated from the work of the family or the community &amp; While gender did shape the
                    lives of women, it was only one of their points of reference."<hi rend="sup">112</hi>
                    Although land ownership conformed to patriarchal dictates, several of these studies suggest
                    significant "cracks in the mold" in other areas. Further research on rural areas
                    throughout the country will be necessary to test these conclusions about gender roles on different
                    farming operations and to ascertain other patterns that reflect not only geographic regions and
                    types of farms but also class, race, and ethnicity.</p>
            <p>Rural women in Indiana offer myriad possibilities for historical research. In addition to exploring
                    the nature of their household labor, studies of rural women in Indiana must determine which kinds of
                    farm labor were undertaken by women and the role of gender <pb n="232" id="VAA4025-090-3-036"/> in
                    the assignment of farm work roles. To what extent did social class determine women's farm
                    chores? Were some chores clearly gendered and others gender neutral? If women worked in the fields
                    was this labor acknowledged and valued within the family and community? How was women's
                    farm labor altered by technological changes in farming methods and equipment?</p>
            <p>Rural women in early-twentieth-century Indiana engaged in a wide variety of income-producing
                    activities on family farms: among other tasks they grew truck gardens, raised chickens, and made
                    butter. How essential was this work to their families' economic survival, and was it
                    recognized by their families? What were the varieties and specific characteristics of
                    women's income-producing work on farms, and how did these change over time? How extensive
                    was noncash trading within the community? What was the nature of women's trade with town
                    merchants and traveling hucksters? Was any of it on a noncash basis? Were women engaged in direct
                    marketing of their products to their own customers in town? What was the significance of
                    women's participation in trading and selling in the local economy? What factors were most
                    significant in the decline of women's farm-based income-producing activities? Indiana

                    wages off the farm? To what extent is paid employment related to rural women's racial,
                    ethnic, and class backgrounds? Explorations of rural life, particularly in the twentieth century,
                    must also include rural women and men who were not engaged in agricultural pursuits at all.</p>
            <p>Preliminary research on rural women in early-twentieth-century Indiana based primarily on the massive
                    oral history project of the Indiana Extension Homemakers Association suggests some tentative
                    conclusions regarding these questions and links Hoosier women to recent historiography on agrarian
                    women generally. Although women's work was often distinguished from male tasks on Indiana
                    farms, there were many exceptions when women joined men in farm labor, especially in dairy
                    operations and on smaller holdings.<hi rend="sup">113</hi> Furthermore, women's gendered
                    work was not cut off from the family's work or from gender-integrated communities of kin,
                    neighbors, and friends. Women were pivotal, in fact central, players in nurturing and maintaining
                    the personal social and economic links that bound rural Hoosiers in their interdependent communities
                    in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It was, for example, the products of
                    women's labor, not the market crops, that were exchanged within the neighborhood or rural
                    community in the early decades of the twentieth century. Rural Hoosier women maintained the family
                    gardens and had responsibility for the processing and distribution of the produce. They traded fresh
                    produce and canned goods with kin and neighbors, exchanges that enhanced the diversity of their
                    diets and strengthened ties of community mutuality. It is also evident that through their dealings
                    with local hucksters and store owners many early-twentieth-century Hoosier women were active
                    participants in the local economy and made significant contributions to their families'
                        incomes.<hi rend="sup">114</hi> Trading with neighbors and relatives was based on trust and
                    reciprocity, but women's dealings with hucksters and town merchants involved exact
                    accounting on both sides.<hi rend="sup">115</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this evidence in the oral histories it appears that Neth's conclusions for
                    early-twentieth-century <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> are echoed in several Indiana communities for the same period: the products of
                    women's labor formed the nucleus of local trade, women were the primary nurturers of
                    community bonds, and they were not consigned to a distinct gendered world. Yet it is also likely
                    that historical research on some nineteenth- and twentieth-century rural communities and on the
                    large wheat-growing farms in northern Indiana may well reveal patterns similar to those observed by
                    Faragher in Sugar Creek, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    </placeName> plains. The regional variations within Indiana and the distinctive farming regions
                    highlighted in the early twentieth century afford scholars voluminous research possibilities. The
                    most valuable of this research will tie the experiences of rural Indiana women in their homes and
                    communities to the large-scale economic, social, and political processes that shaped the history of
                    the entire nation.</p>
            <p>William Tyner, fretting about his delayed harvest and about whether or not he would be able to market
                    his crops, was himself an actor in the capitalist transformation of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the nineteenth century. New rural historians have uncovered different patterns of
                    adaptation, resistance, and change in nineteenth-century rural communities across the country, but
                    regardless of the form, time, or region, the countryside was affected by this transformation and was
                    an integral part of it. Similarly, rural Hoosier homemakers who left their farmhouses to drive to
                    paid employment were players in the vast economic, social, and technological changes in post-World
                    War II American society. Many elderly Hoosiers interviewed for the IEHA oral history project noted
                    this expansion of the paid female work force. "Very few women worked outside the
                    home," an <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Elkhart County</region>
                    </placeName> woman asserted. "The kitchen was their throne room, but today they have their
                    own life and work outside the home. I can't say it is a bad thing, but that is a
                    significant change."<hi rend="sup">116</hi> The same challenge awaits scholars who
                    undertake studies as different as a reconstruction of life in rural <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur County</region>
                    </placeName> in William Tyner's day and an analysis of the decline of home egg production
                    and the increase in off-farm work for women in central Indiana in the years after World War 11: the
                    necessity of linking the histories of individuals, families, and communities to the transformative
                    economic, social, and political processes that affected the entire nation in the nineteenth and
                    twentieth centuries.</p>
            <p>By making these connections, historians just might be able to explain why the old ways of rural
                    Hoosier Alvah Watson's youth are gone. Watson's lament, recorded in the early
                    1980s for the IEHA oral history project, captures what may be the essence of the lingering appeal of
                    traditional rural life: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            1867–1876. As a young man Beeson farmed some land with his brother but spent much
                            of his time working for wages around the neighborhood. Lloyd often hired nearby youths to
                            help in his farming operation, but he also worked for wages himself and traded labor with
                            neighboring farmers.</p>

                        for grain because there were so many new settlers coming into the area that "have no
                        improvements a nuff to rase a sufishency for their own use and have to buy from them."

                        later, however, he reported dramatic changes: "at present our cuntry is very extensive

                     <hi rend="sup">49</hi> Not until 1850 is there detailed census data on agriculture; but the
                            regular decennial censuses and other records, including local papers, receipts, letters,
                            diaries or journals, wills, and account books, shed light on economic activities of Indiana
                            farmers throughout the nineteenth century. The Fred Bateman and James D. Foust sample of
                            rural households from the 1860 manuscript census, which includes data on townships in
                            seventeen Indiana counties, is a valuable source for examining economic activity of rural
                            Hoosiers in the antebellum period. The sample includes agricultural and demographic data for
                            all households in a single rural township in each of 102 randomly selected counties in the
                            North. Of the twenty states from which townships were drawn, Indiana had the most with
                            seventeen. The Indiana counties in the sample are <placeName>

                            </placeName>. These counties, each represented by one township (the authors refer to
                            counties rather than township names), are scattered throughout the state. The sample
                            includes all data from the census of agriculture for each farm. From the population
                            manuscripts Bateman and Foust recorded name of head of household, value of real estate,
                            value of personal estate, plus the color, sex, age, literacy, school attendance, occupation,
                            place of birth, and parents' nationality for each individual in the household.

                            the 1870s but that all machinery was being improved in ways that made it easier to operate
                            and more efficient. Precise dating of adoption of machinery is difficult because there was
                            so much variation even within communities. It is possible to determine when various pieces
                            of equipment became available by displays at the state fairs, which began in the 1850s, but
                            displays do not reveal much about actual use.</p>

                        household conveniences. They were less expensive, they could be run without electrical wiring,
                        and they provided valuable information and entertainment for isolated farm families on the Great
                        Plains. According to Jellison, radios had an enormous impact on farm women's lives.

                        enjoyed for decades. The benefits of electricity were emphasized in countless lessons by the

                            increased the number of rural Indiana homes with electricity. In 1920 the figure was 10
                            percent; in 1930 it was 16.7; in 1937 it was 17.4 percent; and in 1940 it was 51.8 percent.

                            using electricity. The total number of farms in 1935 was 200,835 so it is apparent that
                            prior to the second half of the decade the percentage of homes with electricity had not
                            increased much from 1930. Redfield's commentary is fairly typical in extolling the
                            virtues of electricity for rural homes: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    in cleaning, laundry work and cooking alone amounts to seven hours a week or a
                                    savings of one-third the time required without electricity. Similar figures might be

                                    and water systems. The saving of human energy is often more important than that of
                                    time saving and quite as striking contrasts might be given showing the saving of

                        rural life in the twentieth century will find intriguing questions to explore in the
                        relationship between the Farm Bureau and Purdue University. Although many county agents
                        established solid relationships with Farm Bureau leaders, there is evidence to suggest that some
                        local Farm Bureaus resented the fact that county agents tried to direct the local Farm Bureau
                        activities and seemed to assume that the Farm Bureau was there primarily to promote the
                        agents' programs rather than to promote the economic self-interests of the farmers.
                        There was considerable tension between Purdue agricultural faculty and William H. Settle,
                        Indiana Farm Bureau president from 1923 to 1934. Settle supported federal aid to agriculture and
                        promoted the McNary-Haugen bill in the 1920s. Purdue faculty regarded him as a
                        "misguided radical" and believed that rather than federal aid, farmers could
                        be helped through improved farming techniques. Tracing the evolution of this institutional
                        relationship throughout the twentieth century will make a significant contribution to the
                        understanding of agricultural policies in Indiana. <placeName>

                  <hi rend="sup">69</hi> In the late nineteenth century there was no consensus about what the
                        curriculum for the agricultural colleges should include. Throughout the country there was
                        considerable disagreement between those who favored a practical "how to"
                        course of study and those who supported scientific agriculture. The development of experiment
                        stations at the agricultural schools tended to satisfy many of the objectives of both groups.
                        See Marcus, <hi rend="i">Agricultural Science and the Quest for Legitimacy</hi>. In Indiana the
                        state legislature did not provide support for the Purdue University Experiment Station until
                        1905, which fact made the federal funds from the 1887 Hatch Act critical in these early years.

                        professors and various members of the state board lectured to farmers and farm women, but low
                        attendance signaled the failure of this initial effort. When farmers themselves became more
                        involved, the institutes had wider appeal. There were also women's auxiliaries
                        organized in many counties in conjunction with the Farmers' Institutes. In 1908
                        delegates from the auxiliaries met and concluded that there should be at least one separate
                        session for women at each institute and that all the institutes should use highly respected

                        <p>These records are essential for anyone interested in the work of the county agents, who were

                            longer I am here the [b]usier I become." He complained that he was always
                            "rushed for time with which to push my demonstration work and that the many
                            requests for help with war work "kept us always behind our schedules." He
                            "did not know how to systematize my work and especially the office work."
                            Finally, he noted that there was "too much club work." Midway through the
                            following year Fouts resigned, "not because of dissatisfaction with the work
                            itself, but because I felt I could do better financially in most any other kind of work

                            offer, and that is that the County Agents are very much underpaid for the work that they are
                            expected to do, and the qualifications that they are expected to have, and they should
                            receive a much higher salary than they are now receiving." R. S. Fouts,

                        half of the 1920s is often cited as an example of racism and nativism in the state. Two
                        significant recent studies on the KKK in Indiana reach different conclusions about the
                        importance of racial and religious intolerance as factors that motivated white, Protestant
                        Hoosier men and women to join the KKK. Both, however, found strong support for the KKK in urban

                        political corruption, and with a wide range of other issues that affected individual towns and

                        Indiana in particular owe an enormous debt to Eleanor Arnold and members of the Indiana
                        Extension Homemakers Association for undertaking their oral history project with rural Indiana
                        homemakers in the early 1980s. <hi rend="i">Memories of Hoosier Homemakers</hi>, a six-volume
                        series edited by Arnold, is a rich source of data on the experiences of rural Indiana women,
                        especially for the period between 1890 and 1940. The books offer compelling proof of the merits
                        of oral history in furnishing details about the lives of rural women, families, and communities,
                        details rarely covered in written accounts. The actual interview transcripts are deposited at
                        the Indiana Historical Society and include data on the interviewees not included in the volumes:
                        birthrates, religious affiliations, ethnic backgrounds, farm or nonfarm residences, educational
                        levels, and employment histories. This information helps to explain some of the choices women
                        and their families made. The oral histories, conducted by several different individuals, vary
                        considerably in their quality. In addition to the previously cited <hi rend="i">Girlhood Days,

            <p>On June 17, 1912, Harold Whetstone Johnston, fifty-three, professor and head of Latin at Indiana
                    University since 1895, spent a day in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> transacting miscellaneous business. He met with a friend to discuss bringing the 1913
                    convention of the Classical Association of the Middle West and South to that city, dropped by the
                    office of a political acquaintance, Governor Thomas R. Marshall, and confirmed his intention of
                    stepping down as chairman of the Board of Control of Athletics at Indiana. Late in the afternoon he
                    caught a train on the Vandalia line to Gosport where he changed to the Monon train for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Apparently in good spirits he seated himself jauntily on the railing enclosing the
                    observation platform of the chair car and chatted with two friends about the possibility that an old
                    friend from his undergraduate days at Illinois College, William Jennings Bryan, would be the nominee
                    of the Democratic convention in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He complained of thirst, however, and at one point declared, "I feel like I
                    am burning up inside." Suddenly he lurched forward over the rail; the two friends pulled
                    him back, narrowly averting his fall from the train, and laid him on the floor of the smoking
                    compartment at the rear of the car. Passengers attempted to revive him, but by the time the train
                    received special orders to stop at Ellettsville for a physician, it was too late for professional

                    be conveyed to a funeral home to allow time for the news to be broken to Johnston's wife
                    and eight children. Funeral arrangements were set at Trinity Episcopal Church, where Johnston had
                    been an active layman, and the bishop of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was scheduled to officiate. A special faculty meeting convened on June 18 and passed a
                    resolution warmly describing Johnston's "many years of efficient service"
                    and his "gift of fellowship." All celebrations connected with Commencement were
                    called off.</p>
            <p>Yet another shock was to follow. Because of Johnston's complaints of pain prior to his
                    death, authorities suspected ptomaine poisoning and made the decision to check the contents of his
                    stomach so that his family could collect on his accident insurance. A large quantity of cyanide was
                    discovered. As the coroner reconstructed the episode, Johnston had planned to hide evidence of his
                    intentions by falling from the moving train, thus deflecting attention to the serious neck or skull
                    injuries that would have undoubtedly resulted. Further inquiries revealed that two weeks before his
                    death Johnston had obtained cyanide from a custodian of the chemistry building on campus by telling
                    him he needed to kill a dog and had made inquiries of a colleague in the Chemistry Department to
                    establish how much prussic acid a man could take without the dose proving fatal. Incredibly, the
                    colleague does not seem to have inquired as to the reason for Johnston's interest.</p>
            <p>Who was Harold Whetstone Johnston, and what circumstances led to his end? His career was illustrative
                    of one kind of faculty profile in American higher education at the turn of the century, particularly
                    among the institutions that sprang up in the Midwest when it was still a frontier. As a classicist
                    in that post-frontier culture, Johnston faced the challenge of justifying the usefulness of the
                    humanistic tradition at a time when the primacy of the classics was coming under attack and the
                    Morrill Act had set American land-grant universities unmistakably on a new public service mission.
                    His devotion to the tripartite role of teacher, scholar, and academic citizen not only reflected
                    many of the same tensions and compromises of academic life that are seen today but also an attitude
                    toward his professional responsibilities that some might argue is less common than it once was. Not
                    an academic climber, even by the more relaxed standards of that day, he spent his entire career in
                    two adjacent states yet traveled widely in the service of both his profession and his university.
                    And the trajectory of his career has about it something of both classical tragedy and modern pathos.</p>

                    County judge, and Margaretta Johnston (née Bauer), Johnston lost his father to a
                    mysterious illness, described in the newspaper as a form of paralysis, when he was not <pb n="253" id="VAA4025-090-3-057"/> yet seven years old.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> In 1875 he enrolled as a

                    quarter century, Illinois College was the oldest continuously operating degree-granting institution
                    of higher learning in the state and one of the so-called "Yale band" of colleges
                    in the Midwest whose intellectual and spiritual roots, including a commitment to the antislavery
                    movement, lay in the Northeast.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Sixty men were enrolled in the college in
                    Johnston's first year, and in 1879, the year he graduated, the catalog listed eighty-seven
                    undergraduates. The backbone of the curriculum was still classics, Latin being required for the
                    first three years and Greek for all four.</p>
            <p>At Illinois College Johnston was a baseball enthusiast with belletristic ambitions. He was one of the

                    much collegiate joking, still retains some of its original flavor. In 1879 he became college
                    valedictorian, and his commencement oration, "An Essay on Communism," evidences
                    nothing that would offend the sensibilities of conservative midwestern ears.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    preparatory school attached to the college. At Whipple he set about strengthening the classical
                    course to a point where it was declared by local authority to be the equivalent of the leading

                    correct, his service as principal of Whipple lasted only four years, for in 1884 he became a
                    full-time college faculty member. He distinguished himself in both roles as a firm if not stern
                    taskmaster. One issue of the <hi rend="i">Rambler</hi> in 1883 noted that Johnston had

            <p>For the next decade Johnston spent a quiet life as an instructor, quondam baseball player and coach

                    brother, William H. Hinrichsen, was subsequently to serve as secretary of state under Governor John
                    P. Altgeld and as a one-term congressman. The Johnstons built a house on College Hill on the west

            <p>Because of his sound learning and respectable habits, Johnston might have stayed at Illinois College
                    forever. In 1882 the school awarded him an M.A. for additional studies and in 1891 a Ph.D.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> In 1892, however, Johnston's edition of Cicero's letters and
                    orations for the first time brought his name to the attention of a wider professional audience. The
                    book established his lifelong connection with the firm of Scott, Foresman &amp; Company in <placeName>

                    liberal arts college. The pay was poor, and the life of a professor at such a college was a fishbowl
                    existence, subject to continuing inspection and appraisal by students, colleagues, and community.
                    Thus, when in the fall of 1894 President Joseph Swain of Indiana University extended the offer of an
                    interview, Johnston felt little hesitation. Though Illinois College seems to have countered with the
                    offer of the position of dean of faculty, it was not sufficient to retain him.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    for greener pastures. In a valedictory piece for the college annual, he declared: "Far more

                    years, sometimes attaining a great deal more authority than deans. At Indiana, at least under

                    involved an extension of duties well beyond the campus. Even before his arrival he wrote to
                    President Swain asking for catalog offprints of the description of the Latin program for use in the
                    schools. "It is likely that I shall have to do a good deal of correspondence with high

                    of drinking water during periods of drought meant contaminated drinking supplies, and epidemics of
                    typhoid and smallpox were not unknown. Beneath the inauspicious appearance of things, however, the
                    university was, like the nation, in transition from an agrarian to an industrial environment. Swain

                    Roman civilization and of their own. Though only a small number proceeded to what later would be
                    called a major, the courses, according to a description prepared under Johnston's
                    supervision, were "arranged with the idea of making even the earliest work of interest and
                    practical value to the student." Described as a six-year curriculum for those proceeding to
                    the M.A., the full program was divided into four years of foundation courses for majors and other
                    students satisfying the language requirement; two more, designed for a small number of graduate
                    students, involved the mastery of research techniques in philology. One component of the second
                    (sophomore) year was a lecture on the private life of the Romans, an innovation that probably bore
                    Johnston's hand.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Johnston joined a department that consisted of an assistant professor and two instructors. One of
                    them, Charles Henry Beeson, went on to graduate work at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Munich</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Jacksonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Johnston brought with him a young product of Whipple Academy, Edgar H. Sturtevant, who
                    had taken two years of undergraduate work at Illinois College and was to receive his B.A. at Indiana
                    and his Ph.D. at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> prior to a long and distinguished service at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Yale. Johnston's first report to the president expresses his pleasure with
                    his new colleagues and takes pains to single out Sturtevant (who was shortly thereafter involved in
                    tutoring students junior to him) as a man of "more than ordinary scholarship and good
                    sense." The four members of the department were teaching, by headcount, 117 undergraduates
                    and two graduate students, with Johnston directing the work of the latter and teaching the basic
                    course to 43 on the principle that it was "always well for the freshman to meet the most
                    experienced instructor &amp;."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> He struggled with students of
                    diverse backgrounds and levels of preparation and sought support for a library barely adequate to
                    sustain teaching needs, much less serve as a research collection. For Johnston—as his
                    surviving annual reports to Swain and later to Bryan make clear—a classicist's
                    laboratory <hi rend="i">was</hi> the library. To his first report Johnston attached a long list of
                    reference works that had to be purchased if the library were to fulfill the needs of even advanced
                    undergraduates— <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Although his publications were largely teaching-related, Johnston's professional visibility
                    continued to increase after his move to Indiana University. Following the edition of Cicero
                    published while he was still at Illinois College, Johnston had in 1894 revised the Lowe-Ewing
                    edition of Caesar's <hi rend="i">Gallic Wars</hi> and had become editorial supervisor of
                    the intercollegiate Latin Series at Scott, Foresman. The publisher offered to print
                    Johnston's lectures on Vergil's metrical licenses at no cost for distribution to
                    teachers in the state. Johnston also carried on an increasingly busy travel schedule. One annual
                    report, after commenting on the improvement in student quality and the publication of the lectures
                    on Latin manuscripts that he had delivered in the summer schools, went on to note that he had

                    </placeName>. In the six-week summer session of 1901 Johnston offered three courses per day, one of
                    them intended especially for high school teachers. By this time his reputation in the schools was
                    secured. On October 27, 1898, he wrote to Swain, "I had an opportunity this summer to meet
                    with some of the teachers of Latin in eleven counties, and in four I had conferences with the men
                    and women who are teaching the one or two years' work that is offered in the township
                    schools. I found everywhere recognition of the work of this department, and on the whole agreement
                    with our ideas of the proper direction and scope of work in the school." This interest
                    remained constant throughout his career; a decade later he was writing to President Bryan asking for
                    an increase in faculty and citing the competition at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, DePauw, and Earlham: "It is absolutely necessary that Latin given to freshmen
                    here should be as good as is given elsewhere in the state."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he had been at Illinois College, so at Indiana Johnston was a tireless publicist both for high
                    standards and for the fun of classical education. A paper delivered to the Classical Section of the
                    Indiana State Teachers Association at <placeName>

                    been, whatever may be lost in cold print. Johnston discussed the forms that the teacher of Vergil
                    needed to emphasize in any session devoted to poetical usage. At this point in the
                    student's career, he suggested, one should <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>take for granted the ordinary prose constructions, and the teacher should notice those only
                            that the translation or the scanning shows to have been misunderstood by the pupil.
                            &amp; Such things as the ablative of means, agent, absolute, specification, the dative
                            of possessor, agent, indirect object, may surely be passed now as we pass a friend whom we
                            meet a dozen times a day, with a smile of recognition but without stopping to shake hands.
                            It is intolerable to find these things harped on so late in the course in books otherwise
                            good. If Greenough lets a single ablative of means in the first book go by without a chat
                            and a smoke I have failed to notice it. &amp; If the pupil still halts on these things
                            after three years' drill in lessons, composition, Caesar and Cicero, it is too late
                            to help him. He was either naturally dull on the language side and ought to have dropped
                            Latin long ago, or he has been poorly taught and the superintendent ought to drop the
                            teacher now. If the pupil is trying to read Vergil without these three years of preparation
                            the Board ought to drop the superintendent. Something must drop somewhere.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> the following year, Johnston asked what was so wrong with the teaching of Latin in the
                    schools that the failure rate was almost as high in the second year as in the first. After examining
                    the state of teacher education and the curriculum, he declared that Latin teachers too often were
                    imprecise in their assignments and capricious in their emphasis in the classroom. In one case that
                    he had personally observed, he complained, the teacher stressed something different in each of three
                    successive recitations of the same material. In the second class one girl, he reported indignantly,
                    had been driven to tears <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>because she could not explain, or rather name, the use of <hi rend="i">moribus</hi> in
                            chapter iv of the first book, though she knew it was an ablative and had translated it
                            correctly. I suppose she was naturally dull. I forgot the name myself before I got home and
                            took the trouble to look it up; one grammar called it the ablative of attendant
                            circumstances, another the ablative of cause, another the ablative of specification, another
                            the ablative absolute. I am waiting with interest for the coming of the great grammar, in
                            order to find out for certain what the little dunce was crying about.</p>
                    </quote> Warming to this theme, he insisted that the source of the difficulty lay in "hazy,
                    indefinite, and shifting methods of teaching." To such methods "I charge the
                    positive aversion felt for Latin by many good but slow students. They are not so questioned in any
                    other recitations. It was not good pedagogy, as I look at it, to make that little girl
                    cry." He admonished his audience not to "make a little tin god of the word
                    ‘thoroughness’" and to be grateful if a pupil "translates an
                    ablative correctly even if he can't name it; you cannot name the first hundred ablatives in
                    Caesar the same way twice in succession, and neither could Caesar."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>Throughout his career Johnston was concerned not only with the quality of teaching in the secondary
                    schools but also with the link between the study of Latin there and in college. In the introduction
                    to one of his monographs, <hi rend="i">Latin Manuscripts</hi>, he described the genesis of the book
                    as lectures that he had given at the 1896 summer session of Indiana University to the
                    Teachers' Class on Paleography, Hermeneutics, and Criticism. He expressed the hope that his
                    volume would contain "all that students in High Schools and in the lower classes of
                    Colleges will need in order to understand the critical notes found in the text books commonly used
                    by these classes."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Divided into sections on the history of Latin
                    manuscripts, the science of paleography, and issues in textual criticism, the work is executed at a
                    level that by any measure would seem staggeringly sophisticated to a secondary teacher of Latin or a
                    high school student today. It also evidences an impatience with scholarly animosity of the sort all
                    too common in philological circles. Editors, Johnston wrote, might reasonably vary in their
                    applications of rules of textual evidence, and "it was the failure to recognize the
                    reasonableness of many of these differences of opinion that caused the bitter feeling of the older
                    critics toward each other personally, a feeling that still finds vent occasionally in our
                    philological journals and reviews." With the spread of "improved methods of
                    pictorial reproduction," Johnston looked forward to the eventual extinction of such
                    in-house wrangles.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Johnston's own bibliography, as it stood in an Indiana University publication of 1904,
                    evidences no obviously "original" research.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> His energies,
                    rather, were devoted to transmitting the results of research to Latin teachers and students. His
                    major publication, <hi rend="i">The Private Life of the Romans</hi>, for years enjoyed currency as a
                    text in the schools, and the title still evokes a flicker of recognition among classicists. Its
                    intended audiences, according to the preface, included high school seniors and college freshmen who
                    needed help in understanding references in Latin texts, more advanced college students who needed a
                    text to accompany lectures on Roman society, and finally "readers and students of Roman
                    history, who are engaged chiefly with important political and constitutional questions, and often
                    feel the need of a simple and compact description of domestic life, to give more reality to the
                    shadowy forms whose public careers they are following."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Johnston then

            <p>The style is lucid and unadorned, the tone for the most part dispassionate, except in the chapter on
                    slavery, in which Johnston gives voice to sentiments worthy of a western <placeName>

                    effects were no less destructive." In his recitation of the ways in which slaves pandered
                    to the appetites and ministered to the luxuries of their masters, Johnston traces that decline of
                    Roman character which he believes led to the fall of the empire. Although he states that the more
                    fiendish tortures reported in Roman society are "no more characteristic of the ordinary
                    correction of slaves than lynching and whitecapping are characteristic of the administration of
                    justice in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Indiana," the potential for cruelty in the Roman system is in no way
                    underrated. In his later years in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it is worth noting, Johnston was to serve as foreman of a jury that convicted several
                    "whitecappers" who singled out offenders for vigilante justice of their own,
                    and—in a day and place where the only requirements for the practice of law were a minimum
                    age of twenty-one and good moral character—he was also to be admitted to the bar, though
                    he seems never to have practiced. Perhaps, on some obscure level, his application was a tribute to
                    the father he had hardly known.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>Another area in which Johnston remained perpetually active as university citizen was that of

                    intercollegial athletics at Indiana University, a move that resulted in the abolition of the
                    position of director of athletics; and he rigidly enforced standards for eligibility, though he had
                    also opposed what he felt to be unnecessarily stringent rules preventing student athletes from
                    earning money from their game during the summer. And he had a fan's eye for the details of
                    the game while remaining realistic and principled about institutional priorities. When in 1910 Ralph
                    C. "Skel" Roach, the baseball coach, demanded a substantial increase in salary,
                    Johnston said that he would coach the team himself rather than allow such a commitment.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The 1909 <hi rend="i">Arbutus</hi>, Indiana University's yearbook,

                    victory are few that have not known ‘Doc's’ accompaniment of
                    inimitable wit and peculiarly inspiring words of encouragement." He "has often

                    needed stability. But he also reiterated his intention of withdrawing from active participation in

                    their spare time, he declared, was their business as long as their conduct was irreproachable.
                    "I venture to say that the members of no other college faculty in <placeName>

                    workload, the second time in the form of the appointment of a special committee convened in March to
                    investigate the matter and report back in June. On both occasions Swain sought information from his
                    department heads, and Johnston's responses on both occasions have been preserved. The
                    second is the fuller and more vivid of the two. It begins with the statement that Johnston is
                    teaching two hours a day, "less &amp; than usual by one or two hours a week"
                    because of ill health. It is impossible, he writes, to estimate the number of hours a day devoted to
                    study, but he believes that three hours would be a fair estimate, not taking into account the
                    reading and, in his own case, the need to devise textbooks for an area in which they were not
                    available. Perhaps fifteen hours have gone into a single lecture, he estimates, for "it is
                    my intention to give to work connected with Latin all my time except what is needed for
                    ‘living.’ I have never been an idle man, though I like to play when I do

            <p>Johnston's last three points warrant more extensive quotation, for while they are
                    anticipatory of much of today's debate on faculty workload, what is known of his own labor
                    makes clear that they were neither exaggerated nor self-pitying: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>(4) It is utterly impossible to give an estimate of the work for the university done outside
                            of the class room. Committee work takes some time: it counts chiefly in thought and anxiety.
                            Much if not all of my outside work counts directly or indirectly for the university. There
                            is hardly a school in the state in which one of my books is not used, and this counts more
                            than the preparation of lessons in the way of directing attention to the university. I have
                            a very large correspondence with teachers of Latin in all parts of the state: I have even
                            cleared up difficulties for Superintendent Study's successor in Ft. Wayne. I am in
                            the habit of attending the meetings of the State Association of Teachers at <placeName>

                            Section go. I would not think of spending two or three days at these meetings, were it not
                            my hope that my presence there counted for the University. I give as much time as I am asked
                            to give in the summer time during "vacation" to the visiting of
                            Institutes.</p>
                        <p>(5) I have not been connected with any other state university. In Illinois College I often
                            taught from fifteen to twenty hours a week, but only in cases when the work was chiefly
                            secondary. I can do four hours a day of secondary Latin with less wear and tear and fatigue
                            than one hour a day of the instruction I give to my seniors. It is not the number of hours
                            but the kind of work that counts for the university and thus the man.</p>
                        <p>(6) I am glad that the president has put these questions: they ought to be answered fairly
                            and fully &amp; I do not think that I could materially increase the number of hours I

                    purpose. At the June meeting of the board Swain took head-on exception to the tendency of the
                    trustees' questions by stating flatly his objection to an arbitrary rule governing teaching
                    hours: uniformity was impossible under the elective system even if it were desirable, which it was
                    not if the end in sight was to secure the loyalty of the faculty to the university. He also pointed
                    out that the teaching load at Indiana was heavier than at comparable institutions.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Johnston's own private life had not been without incident since his move to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. To the four surviving children born in <placeName>

                    of them taking degrees. A positive image in the community was as much a requisite at a state
                    university as at a small liberal arts college at the turn of the century, and the student newspaper
                    carried frequent stories of Johnston's activities both on and off campus. He solemnly
                    assumed duties as a judge of jams and jellies at a local fair, and when an invited Armenian speaker
                    at Friday morning chapel failed to appear, Johnston described the nonappearance as "another
                    Armenian outrage."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Around the campus his idiosyncracies became a
                    predictable part of the landscape. Years after his death, when the Harold Whetstone Johnston
                    Graduate Residence Hall was dedicated in the early 1970s, S. Frank Davidson, professor emeritus of
                    English, recalled seeing him often "as he mounted the steps of Science Hall smoking a big
                    cigar. Always, just before entering the door, he would take a final puff, smother the fire, and lay
                    the cigar on a stone coping."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> At the dedication ceremony an emeritus
                    trustee approached two of Johnston's surviving daughters saying, "He was my best
                    friend. I couldn't have got through without the help he gave me."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>Such memories recalled a vigorous, thoughtful man whose every action carried a note of almost cocky,

               </figure> But pressures were real and mounting. With a growing family the move to Indiana still did
                    not meet Johnston's financial needs. He had hardly been in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> six months when an offer of a faculty appointment at the then handsome sum of
                    $3,000 came from the new University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The episode makes for interesting reading as an example of turn-of-the-century faculty
                    bargaining. Indiana countered with an offer of a raise to $2,500 beginning in August,
                    1897, but made no adjustments for the forthcoming 1896–1897 academic year. Johnston, in a
                    letter to Swain, pointed out that the difference between the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> offer and his present salary of $2,000 was $1,000 per annum. He
                    was willing to split the difference; but, because the offer had come late in the year, he had
                    offered to ask for only $2,250 in 1896–1897. "I am greatly in need of
                    money <hi rend="i">now</hi>, and I will say frankly that the $2500 for
                    1897–1898 loses much of its charm to me if I am not to have the $2250 this
                    year. I assure you that $2250 <hi rend="i">now</hi> means much more in comparison with

                    <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-090-3-073"/> Johnston's argument prevailed, albeit tardily; that
                    November the board raised him to the requested sum, a move that made him the sixth highest salaried
                    person on the faculty and administrative staff.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Johnston's taste for creature comforts, already demonstrated in what were reportedly rather
                    handsome bachelor digs in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jacksonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, did not abate. It seems a reasonable inference that his spending patterns varied
                    depending in part on the receipt of additional royalties and other payments from his work for Scott,
                    Foresman. He also was a hospitable man, and the scope of that hospitality as well as the size of his
                    family demanded corresponding living quarters. Visitors from elsewhere, including his college friend
                    William Jennings Bryan, frequently stayed with the Johnstons during trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the early years of the century construction was begun on a new house at 814 East
                    Third Street. Entered from a Roman-style vestibule, the house was three stories in height. It
                    boasted six bedrooms on the second floor (three at the front and three at the back) and a bathroom
                    at the end. Several of the second floor bedrooms had fireplaces, and all the rooms had gas as well
                    as electric lights. In the summer the house drew many guests, and on the fourth of July Johnston
                    always set off fireworks in the front yard, which was banked high above the sidewalk. He began the
                    day's celebrations early by lighting the firecrackers from his pipe, a practice of which
                    his wife disapproved.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A superstitious observer might have seen an ill omen at the very beginning when on January 24, 1907,
                    the Indiana <hi rend="i">Student</hi> reported, "while inspecting the construction work on
                    his handsome new East Third Street residence yesterday Prof. H. W. Johnston had the misfortune to
                    fall from the first floor to the basement, wrenching and injuring his right leg severely."
                    The heavy mortgage on the house meant that Johnston had difficulty meeting other expenses. One of
                    his closest friends, John W. Cravens, registrar and for many years secretary to the Board of
                    Trustees, frequently received letters from Johnston while the latter was traveling throughout the
                    state. Cravens periodically sent Johnston advances on his paycheck, a practice not uncommon at
                    Indiana where not only were the salaries low but the payment made on a quarterly basis.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> A number of requests survive from the last twelve months of
                    Johnston's life, for example from a trip to <placeName>

                    obituaries especially." The following day another card with grim allusiveness raised, in
                    verse, the possibility of returning to <placeName>

                    had begun taking out large insurance policies when he traveled. In a typical letter to Cravens
                    written on December 26, 1911, on the stationery of the Claypool Hotel in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    for $5,000 "to hold until I come back to you safely or die in the
                    attempt." He urged Cravens to say nothing about the two policies "unless I meet
                    with an accident, in which case you will see that these two (2) and my other policies (4) are got
                    into action <hi rend="i">quick."</hi> Returning from <placeName>

                    (first expired)." On June 8, 1912, a few days before his death, he wrote from the Palmer
                    House in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    send you another good for Sunday too." The remainder of the letter describes his
                    satisfaction at the work done, at the fact that his oldest son had decided to return to the
                    university, and that another son, Harry, was "slated for a big promotion" with
                    Scott, Foresman. Finally, he was pleased that his own royalties were on the rise, and he looked for
                    "good returns on all our Latin books next year."</p>
            <p>For six months at least Johnston had been trying to imagine his family and his university without
                    him. On December 23, 1911, a few days before departing for the NCAA meeting, he wrote to President
                    Bryan asking if it would be possible for the university to arrange for the payment of salaries in
                    full to the families of faculty members for the unexpired portion of the year when their death
                    occurred during the term. And then, unexpectedly, he instanced himself: <list type="footnotes">

                    Bryan would not object to his daughter Mary's filling the place at Indiana during the last
                    week or so. "She has the A.M. for work done here, has had one full year's work in

            <p>Who is to know what weighed most heavily on his mind those last days? Certainly the last extended
                    letter to Cravens was in the nature of a summing-up and valedictory, drawing assurance from the
                    projected future of the two oldest boys who would not be a burden to the widow he would leave
                    behind. The merging of three departments into one appears to have represented a realistic assessment
                    of the future of his own profession as well as an attempt to discover economies whereby tight
                    university resources might be freed for the relief of faculty families. Several days before
                    Johnston's death the building association that held the mortgage foreclosed on his Third
                    Street house with $8,000 due. The threatened loss of his home was probably the final blow
                    to a proud man, and Johnston may have calculated that he would actually leave his family better off
                    by dying. With cruel irony, however, one of the <placeName>

                    $2,925 for 1908–1911, and $3,125 for 1911–1912 and noted

            <p>From the historian's point of view what is the significance of Johnston's story? In
                    what respects, up to but not including its tragic denouement, did it typify a midwestern college
                    professor at the turn of the century? The historiography of American higher education, dominated as
                    it is either by large panoramic accounts or by institutional histories and presidential memoirs, has
                    seldom reached down to the working level of actual faculty careers. More case histories like
                    Johnston's might help to identify the variables, to distinguish issues of professional
                    standing from personal crises. After all, men and women in many different walks of life, growing up
                    in the sometimes harsh isolation of the nineteenth-century prairies, beleaguered by problems that
                    seemed to be spiraling out of control, at least must have contemplated the same
                    "solution" as Johnston, even if in the vast majority of cases they rejected it.</p>
            <p>In Johnston's case the outcome of that private drama was particularly redolent of his
                    lifelong study of ancient <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but his career must also be seen as part of a transitional period in the
                    professionalization of American higher education, when the older model of the faculty member as
                    moral guide and campus citizen was giving way to the newer guild orientation reflected by the
                    development of professional societies and other networks of scholarly exchange.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Johnston's younger colleagues at Indiana, Beeson and Sturtevant, represent the
                    emerging model; Johnston, whose institutional commitments were only partly defined by his field of
                    study, and who was wittily skeptical about the creation of a graduate college at Indiana, represents
                    the older pattern.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Even the move from Illinois College, where as a valued
                    alumnus he might easily have spent the remainder of his days, to Indiana University, while
                    undoubtedly related to his growing visibility as a classicist, was less decisive an indicator of his
                    scholarly standing than it would be now. In 1895 Indiana University was far from being a major
                    research institution, and the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                            belief in the inadequacy of the library. For the general climate of hostility in the state
                            toward the funding of graduate education see William O. Lynch's memories of his
                            life as a student at Indiana University at the turn of the century, "A Student at
                            Indiana University," <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, XXXIII

                    <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-090-3-079"/> These considerations also suggest that one relatively
                    unexplored dimension of turn-of-the-century faculty mobility is the possibility of regional
                    variation: that in the Midwest more than in the longer-established eastern schools institutional
                    definition, and therefore the career of a faculty member, was more fluid and variable in its
                    outcomes.</p>
            <p>Today's universities still harbor many faculty members whose commitments lie more toward
                    service or teaching than research, and conversely as early as 1892 a popular teacher at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> who published little or nothing might go many years without promotion.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> But Johnston's apparent view of himself as first and foremost a total
                    "citizen" of the university is a model that many observers today see as an
                    endangered species. That fact is, of course, a concomitant of the growth of scholarly communities
                    that transcend campus boundaries and weaken institutional ties. Had the administrative structure of
                    Indiana University at the turn of the century offered the range of options characteristic of
                    today's research universities, it is possible that Johnston, with his concern for the
                    working environment, might have become a full-time administrator. But then it is equally possible
                    that he might not. As it was, heads of departments under Bryan, as has been noted, effectively
                    constituted a presidential cabinet far more powerful than any decanal position. And it is difficult
                    to imagine Johnston willingly renouncing any role that kept him in contact with students and with
                    teachers in the schools, his two primary audiences throughout his life.</p>
            <p>Finally, any study of faculty careers, then or now, must engage the issue of the status and
                    expectations of a particular discipline. In Johnston's story lies an opportunity for the
                    historian of classical studies in America. Johnston's suggestions on departmental merger
                    suggest a fairly clearheaded forecast of the future of classical studies not only at Indiana
                    University but at other growing public institutions. He cannot have forgotten that at the time he
                    came to Indiana the burning of copies of Horace to celebrate the release of undergraduates from the
                    study of Latin was still an annual rite. Particularly galling to a classicist's
                    sensibilities would have been the fact that the student newspaper challenged the perpetuation of
                    this rite on the grounds that it gave undue weight to a study about which few even knew or cared.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Yet Johnston seems never to have wavered in his view that the study of Latin
                    could be an integral part of preparation for modern life; such a compelling belief must have
                    supported his concern for basic language instruction at a time <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The influence that the study of Roman values cast over Johnston's life was present in the
                    circumstances of his death. The point emerges in the juxtaposition of two passages, the first from
                    Samuel Butler's witty and scathing account of his religious unconversion, published
                    (posthumously) the same year as the first edition of <hi rend="i">The Private Life of the
                    Romans</hi>. <quote rend="blockquote">

                            of his life; dreadful as such tidings must be, we do not find that they unnerve the greater
                            number of mankind; most men, indeed, go coolly enough even to be hanged, but the strongest
                            quail before financial ruin, and the better men they are, the more complete, as a general
                            rule, is their prostration. Suicide is a common consequence of money losses; it is rarely

            <p>Although this description rings true in Johnston's situation, the second passage, from <hi rend="i">The Private Life of the Romans</hi>, seems more apposite to his troubled last days. In
                    the first chapter of the book, devoted to the Roman family, he had written: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It was customary for the Head of the House to assign to his children property &amp; for
                            them to manage for their own benefit. And more than this, although the <hi rend="i">pater
                                familias</hi> held legal title to all their acquisitions, yet practically all property
                            was acquired for and belonged to the household as a whole, and he was in effect little more
                            than a trustee to hold and administer it for the common benefit. This is shown by the fact
                            that there was no graver offense against public morals, no fouler blot on private character,
                            than to prove untrue to this trust, <hi rend="i">patrimonium profundere</hi>.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> Thus, though Johnston's death—despite the miscarriage in its
                    staging—was carried out with the aid of modern science, something of a classical fatality
                    hung over it. Perhaps, as he weighed himself against the ancient Romans that he had studied for so
                    many years, suicide assumed for him the character of a justified self-retribution. It is altogether
                    typical of the man, in any case, that he fulfilled his contract to the letter, timing his last
                    decision for the end of the term.</p>
            <p>Among the Johnston papers at Indiana University there survive several pages in a round, clear
                    handwriting, not his own, on the subject of fame, old age, and death. A reasonable hypothesis is
                    that they were intended to be read at his memorial service and were chosen by his eldest daughter.
                    One, from Book III (Ode XXX) of Horace, speaks of a verse monument "more lasting than

                    <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-090-3-081"/> Pliny's letters (Book 1, No. 12), strikes a more
                    personal note, lamenting the death of a man who escaped lifelong illness, left his relatives and the
                    state surviving, and yet at whose departure grief, like that "over the death of a young and
                    strong man," cannot be gainsaid. But perhaps the most fitting is from Tacitus's
                    life of Agricola. In his narrative of Agricola's last days, Tacitus points out that
                    Agricola was rumored to have been poisoned (though not by his own hand) and that he was in his
                    fifty-fourth year at the time of his death. He expresses his regret that both he and
                    Agricola's daughter were denied the rewards of being with Agricola in his last days.

            <p>Milo Smith Hascall (1829–1904) came to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Elkhart County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in September, 1847, as but the latest member of his family to travel west

                    follow. Those six brothers and sisters, having already established themselves in their new setting,
                    provided a ready-made web of social, political, and business connections into which the young
                    migrant quickly and comfortably settled. Such advantages promptly secured for him one of the rare
                    and coveted prizes that a young man in nineteenth-century America could win: a free education at one
                    of the country's elite educational institutions.</p>
            <p>Milo Hascall was born in Le Roy, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the ninth and youngest child of Amasa and Phoebe Hascall. Amasa Hascall, while a
                    farmer of apparently modest means in comparison to his more aMuent and prominent brothers, played an
                    active role in the politics of Genesee County.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Young Hascall was raised and
                    schooled in Le Roy, a town that struggled during the lean depression years of the 1830s and early
                    1840s. Those decades witnessed a significant exodus from Genesee County and the region of western <placeName>

                    first letter published here makes clear, his original plan was to work in his oldest
                    brother's general store. Not liking the business, he employed his scholarly attainments and
                    taught at the local town school. When another opportunity arose, one that showed greater promise of
                    advancement in directions more to his liking, he seized on it as a <list type="footnotes">

                    self-assured young man, harbored ambitions for greater things. The possibility of a place as a cadet
                    at the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Military Academy does not appear to have been in his original plans, but the
                    opportunity for an excellent education was certainly too enticing to dismiss once it occurred.
                    Clearly, Hascall owed the nomination to the academy to his family ties to important local
                    politicians and his educational attainments.</p>
            <p>Hascall graduated from the military academy in 1852 and entered the regular army as a brevet second
                    lieutenant of artillery with an enviable posting on the east coast. He does not appear to have
                    contemplated a military career, however; and for reasons that are not known he resigned his
                    commission in September, 1853, having served little more than a year. The dull and routine life of
                    garrison duty may have come as a shock to him—as it did to many other
                    graduates—after living in the rarified intellectual atmosphere found at West Point. The
                    prospect of glacially slow promotion within the army also may have discouraged him;<hi rend="sup">3</hi> or he may have preferred to put his newly attained engineering and applied mathematics
                    skills to work in some more lucrative field, such as the then booming railroad business. After a
                    brief period of travel Hascall returned to Indiana to enter into railroad work. Soon, however, he
                    settled down in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> to read law. He entered into a practice with his prominent brother-in-law, Ebenezer
                    Mattoon Chamberlain; speculated in real estate; and began a decades-long political career in the
                    Republican party.</p>
            <p>Hascall is best known today for his exploits during the Civil War. Enlisting at the outbreak of war
                    and quickly rising to the command of an Indiana volunteer regiment, he soon attained the rank of
                    brigadier general of volunteers and participated in many important campaigns. Hascall has received
                    most notoriety, however, for his brief tenure in 1863 as commander of the military district of
                    Indiana, during which time his vigorous efforts to suppress the Democratic opposition to President
                    Abraham Lincoln so embarrassed Republican politicians in Indiana and <placeName>

                                 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Original spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and
                                            grammar have been retained throughout the following transcription of the
                                            Milo S. Hascall correspondence. Hascall in the earlier letters frequently
                                            omitted the use of periods at the end of sentences; double spaces have been
                                            employed to indicate sentence breaks. While at West Point he began (perhaps
                                            as a result of his instructors' prodding) to punctuate his letters
                                            more completely. Paragraph breaks are, for the most part, as they appear in
                                            the letters, though some of Hascall's indentations at the beginning
                                            of paragraphs were minimal (perhaps as a way to optimize space). At various
                                            places throughout the letters small inverted carets appear above the line.
                                            Although it is impossible to determine from the photocopies on which this
                                            transcription is based whether the marks were Hascall's or were
                                            added by someone else at a later time, they do occur at logical paragraph
                                            breaks and have been transcribed as such. Sentences written in the margins
                                            of a letter have been placed at the end of the letter. Words that are
                                            unclear or illegible have been put in brackets with a question mark in the
                                            brackets if the word cannot be made out. Spacing of headings, salutations,
                                            and closings has been standardized. Underlined words have been placed in
                                            italics; words underlined twice or three times have been italicized and
                                            underlined.</item>

                                            Ebenezer M. Chamberlain he moved to <placeName>

                                            his medical practice. Elected county auditor and later chosen auditor of
                                            state (1850–1853), he was an influential Democratic party leader
                                            from northern Indiana. He also became involved in other newspaper ventures.
                                            A brother-in-law to the Hascalls (having married a sister of Chauncey S.

                                            was also involved in the Hascall dry goods firm, and he later invested in
                                            real estate and railroad stocks with Chauncey S. Hascall. The venture failed
                                            disastrously. Neither man fully recovered financially. Ellis, however,

                                            cadet nominees. The fact that Hascall's father was a Whig when his
                                            son was chosen by Democratic Congressman Cathcart to go to West Point
                                            emerged in a similar controversy played out in the <placeName>

                                            </placeName> press in 1859. At that time Milo Hascall enjoyed a close
                                            political relationship with the incumbent congressman, Republican Charles
                                            Case. Hascall was accused of brokering Case's nomination for the
                                            son of E. M. Chamberlain, a Democrat, his brother-in-law and law partner.
                                            The accuser, George Howell, Republican father of the rival candidate for
                                            nomination, claimed that Hascall had informed him that Case would nominate
                                            any candidate whom Hascall chose and that Hascall had promised
                                            Howell's son would receive the nod. Howell stated, however, that
                                            Hascall had reneged on his pledge, explaining that he "was indebted
                                            to the Judge [chamberlain] for his own appointment to the Cadetship, when he
                                            was a stranger here." Hascall, in a reply published in the <placeName>

                                            <hi rend="i">Times</hi>, defended his switch, conceding, "I had
                                            received the same favor [nomination] of Dr. Ellis and Judge Chamberlain, and
                                            that, too, when I was a staunch Whig, and they strong democrats,"
                                            and that "Judge Chamberlain now claimed that I was in honor bound
                                            to do what I could for him." Hascall dismissed the affair as a
                                            "purely personal matter" "in which the public can
                                            have but little interest." Nonetheless, he received severe
                                            criticism by his fellow Republicans for passing over a Republican for a
                                            family connection. See <placeName>

                                    into the institution as a Cadet There were seventy one Candidates for admission this

                                    Immediately after passing our examination we repaired to the Camp Ground pitched our

                                    Eighty Tents to accommodate all the Cadets and Officers The tents the Cadets occupy
                                    are about ten feet square. (I wrote the above last Sabbath and it is now Wednesday
                                    and the first opportunity I have had to write any more) The tents are all of new
                                    cloth this year and are constructed in such a manner that they dont leak at all
                                    during a continued rain. They all have good matched floors which are raised about
                                    six inches from the ground Our Bedding while in Camp consists of two Indian Blankets

                                    write a very lengthy Letter. but merely to give you a general idea of matters and
                                    things at present. When I wrote you before I was living in Camp I believe. On the
                                    first of September we came again into Barracks and commenced our studies.</p>
                        <p>Our studies from September to January are Davies Bourden Algebra throughout
                                    "Sturms Theorum"<hi rend="sup">29</hi> and all. English Grammar
                                    and Geography. In Geography we had to learn to draw all the States of the US. on the
                                    Blackboard without looking on the map putting down all the Rivers towns &amp;c
                                    of any note and they were equally Scientific in the other Studies We had to complete
                                    these in the four months and are then examined. You are probably aware that if we
                                    are found deficient at this examination we are dismissed as at the one for
                                    admission. Our Class (consisting of all those that came in last June) numbered about
                                    Eighty at first. Of these two were found deficient at the Examination for admission
                                    ten resigned between Sept and January for fear of being found at that time and
                                    thirteen were found deficient at the Examination so that we have already got reduced
                                    down to sixty five and I expect that before we graduate we will be reduced down to
                                    one half of our original no as this is generally the case with every class that
                                    comes on here. We have a standing made out in both Mathematics and Ethics (Grammar
                                    and Geography) at the Examination and from these one general standing in the Class
                                    is made out.</p>
                        <p>I came out sixteenth in Mathematics and twenty sixth in Ethics which makes me
                                    Nineteenth in general standing This is considered to be a very good standing and
                                    indeed considering the advantages I have heretofore had for getting an Education in

                                    do. However I am in hopes that by strict attention to my studies &amp;c I shall
                                    be able to approximate rather nearer to the Head before I <hi rend="i">graduate</hi>

                                    are Geometry, Trigonometry (plane &amp; spherical), Descriptive Geometry, the

                                    before January We have to finish all these except the French Language and a small
                                    portion of the Descriptive Geometry and get done by the first of June so that you
                                    will readily perceive that we have very little time for lying <hi rend="i">"upon our oars"</hi> We have to study French a year and a
                                    half which will keep us at it all next year. When we first began French I could not
                                    get along with it very well and was somewhat afraid that it would be the means of
                                    giving me an <hi rend="i">"indefinite Leave of Absence"</hi> next
                                    June, but I am getting along with it rather better nowadays and think that I shall
                                    not have any difficulty in getting along with it sufficiently well to keep from
                                    being found, though I never expect to stand well in French. I am getting along very
                                    well with the other studies and I think that I can do well enough in them to make up
                                    for what I lose in French, so that I believe now that instead of being <hi rend="i">found</hi> in June, I shall be able to stand as high in the Class as I do at
                                    present. Descriptive Geometry is a very curious and I think very interesting study.
                                    It deals principally with immensity of Space and of course gives rise to some
                                    sublime ideas. When you go down to Samsons Book store ask him to let you see one of
                                    the Books, and then look at some of the Plates along through it, you can then form
                                    something of an idea how we have to <hi rend="i">"Bone"</hi> to
                                    get over it in the very short time allotted to the study of it. Our class have now

            <p>This collection of sixteen essays treats a wide range of topics related to the history of African
                    Americans in Indiana from the antebellum era to the present. Skillfully edited and rationally
                    organized, the collection is introduced by a perceptive foreword by Richard Blackett. The thirteen
                    contributors have presented the results of their research in clear and often graceful prose. Their
                    skill in historical sleuthing is especially evident in Xenia Cord's analysis of rural black
                    settlements prior to 1860, Earline Rae Ferguson's study of black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the same era, and Marvin D. Jeter's sketch of H. J. Lewis, an illustrator
                    and reputedly the nation's "first black political cartoonist" (p. 161).</p>
            <p>In one way or another these essays focus on African-American efforts to build institutions and
                    community autonomy and on individual and collective achievements in the face of great odds, as
                    demonstrated in particular by the essays on clergyman John H. Clay, editor Julius Holder, artist
                    William Edouard Scott, and architect Samuel Plato. That Indiana, a free state often viewed as a
                    haven by blacks from the South, witnessed the emergence of virulent racism early in its history is
                    dramatized by the fate that befell James Overall and John Tucker in 1838 and 1845. Stanley
                    Warren's essay on the evolution of the segregated Crispus Attucks High School in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Gloria Gibson-Hudson's study of the origins of the Walker Theatre in that
                    city suggest the persistence of a pervasive racism.</p>
            <p>Several contributions by and about women are especially noteworthy. For example, Emma Lou Thornbrough
                    provides a highly informative overview of the important part played by Indiana's black
                    women in building institutions and combating discrimination and suggests new areas worthy of
                    exploration. Ferguson's skillfully drawn portrait of Lillian Thomas Fox, journalist and
                    clubwoman, and Gibson-Hudson's references to the role of Madam C. J. Walker and her

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Hard Pieces</hi> is a collection of over seventy columns that Dan Carpenter published
                    between 1981 and 1992 in the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi>. Short, colorful, controversial, and incisive, they serve as a good
                    introduction to the author's interests, preferences, and passions. Carpenter is clearly
                    interested in people, especially in individuals at the fringes where headlines are seldom made.
                    Heavily based upon interviews, his essays show an ear for dialogue and an eye for telling detail,
                    infusing personality and substance into brief sketches. Whether the subject is the custodian of a
                    rural statue honoring the civil air patrol ("Sleeping Safe"), a circus performer
                    who made his living being shot from a cannon ("The Great Wilno"), or Dick the
                    Bruiser touring a veterans' hospital ("Most Dangerous Wrestler"), the
                    result is a personality eloquently encapsulated. The essays are grouped into five sections that
                    focus upon Carpenter's interests in the vanishing rural scene ("Crossroads and
                    Cul-de-sacs"), the changing urban environment ("Corners"), the world of
                    athletics ("Games"), the fleeting nature of fame ("Names"), and
                    his own perceptions of the price of boosterism ("Reflections").</p>
            <p>A foe of progress at the expense of personal values, Carpenter often turns to subjects that explore
                    the profound sense of loss that can permeate individual or community experience. His essay on the
                    Emil Platzer properties ("Haunted Houses") is an outstanding example, as are the
                    varied essays on his southside <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> boyhood. David Hoppe's introduction correctly places Carpenter in that
                    enduring school of Hoosier writers whose central concern is the fragility of public and personal
                    self-images at the moments they contradict changing community attitudes and interests. It would be
                    equally appropriate to identify in Carpenter's writing the blend of nostalgia and
                    skepticism that stands as the key Hoosier challenge to the booster spirit. In the best Hoosier style
                    of self-deprecation, Carpenter acknowledges his label of "house liberal" (p. xiii)
                    at the <hi rend="i">Star</hi>. It is obvious, however, that he draws upon much more varied sources.
                    Entertaining and controversial, his <hi rend="i">Hard Pieces</hi> make for good reading.</p>

            <p>George Winter (1809–1876), an English-born artist of modest talent, is remembered
                    primarily for his drawings of Potawatomi and Miami Indians. While living for a time in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Winter learned of the pending removal by the federal government of the Potawatomi to
                    lands west of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Impulsively, he rushed to Indiana in time to record one of the saddest moments in
                    Potawatomi history.</p>
            <p>Winter came to Indiana thinking he would linger a few months and remained, instead, for the rest of
                    his life. He died in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1876. Winter worked in pencil, oil, and watercolor. He tried his hand at
                    portraiture, landscape, and still life. As an artist he <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-090-3-103"/> enjoyed
                    little financial success and, during his lifetime, even less public acclaim. He merits recognition
                    today for his accurate depiction of the Potawatomi and Miami Indians at a critical moment in their
                    history. Winter filled several sketchbooks with eyewitness drawings of these Native Americans in a
                    transitional state between their traditional life ways and their acculturation to the dominant
                    society. He sketched women and children as well as prominent leaders. His drawings demonstrate that
                    these tribes, for the most part, had already achieved a high degree of acculturation. Many were
                    financially successful, even by the white standards of the day.</p>
            <p>Although Winter's drawings are not great art, they are invaluable ethnographic documents and
                    merit the lavish treatment they have received in this grand and handsome publication. Indeed, the
                    publishers could not have done better in their choice of essayists. Christian F. Feest, who profiles
                    Winter's life and artistic attainments, is chair of North American Indian ethnology studies
                    at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
                    </placeName>. R. David Edmunds, a member of the history faculty of Indiana University, is the
                    foremost authority on the Potawatomi. His thoughtful and insightful essay examines Winter's
                    work from an ethnographic perspective. As Edmunds correctly points out, Winter's
                    "depictions of Indian costumes and daily life are unsurpassed" and provide
                    "the best visual record of Native American life in Indiana during this period (p. 37).</p>
            <p>This elegantly published volume includes a catalog that is as complete as possible of
                    Winter's ethnographic drawings as well as other items of interest to Hoosiers including
                    sketches of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> battlefield and individuals of importance in Indiana history. Of particular interest
                    are the drawings of Frances Slocum, a <placeName>

                    had been commissioned by her brother when she refused to give up her Indian way of life and return
                    to her family.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Boats Against the Current: American Culture Between Revolution and Modernity,
                        1820–1860</hi>. By Lewis Perry. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

            <p>In this richly nuanced, insightful, and often brilliant study, Lewis Perry situates the origin of
                    modern American culture in Jacksonian society. Perry eschews traditional literary analysis and
                    cultural icons for social experiences and collective voices. He portrays an emerging modernist
                    culture arising from a protean world <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-090-3-104"/> constantly in motion and
                    continually in the process of evolution and self-definition.</p>
            <p>A highly mobile lot, traveling widely at home and abroad, Jacksonians "were shuttles weaving
                    a new civilization" (p. 129). In their diaries, travelogues, and memoirs, antebellum
                    Americans embraced a collective outlook that was at once doggedly optimistic about persistent
                    improvement and anxiously adrift "in a sea of uncertainty" (p. 215). They
                    recorded, reflected, and pondered the tensions noted by Europeans such as Alexis de Tocqueville and
                    Fredrika Bremer between a leveling democracy and the uncertain potential of a fluid society driven
                    by slavery.</p>
            <p>Perry maintains that historical landmarks provided Jacksonians with few relevant guideposts in their
                    voyage into this unknown future. If all paid homage to heroic forebears, few saw any timeless moral
                    lessons issuing from the revolutionary experience. Jacksonians, emphasizing the here and now,
                    increasingly viewed history as irrelevant and became largely indifferent to it.</p>
            <p>Determined to break with and be free from the dead hand of tradition, post-revolutionary Americans
                    created for themselves an ever-shifting present that was flexible and progressive, and which
                    encompassed (or was defined by) a plurality of relative moral perspectives. Lacking a cultural
                    tradition either inherited or imposed from above, Americans spoke in a variety of languages (or
                    vernaculars) and adopted multiple personas that allowed them to cope with "a highly complex
                    pattern of inconsistent roles" required by modernity (p. 171). Locating a permanent core of
                    values became problematic, however. If Jacksonians insisted that life in America was grand, the
                    process of creating and transforming a New World caused apprehension in more than a few.</p>
            <p>While Perry limns the essence of what America was to become, he is less clear about what it once was.
                    That something was lost in this process of modernization is apparent; what values inhered to that
                    earlier communal society are not. The agents of change are at best inferred, and the transformation
                    of antebellum society is described rather than explained. Finally, although Perry skillfully and
                    persuasively links the contradictions and tensions of the Jacksonian world to the present, it is
                    also worth noting that one thread that connects them—optimism about the future and
                    uncertainty and ambivalence about the direction and meaning of change—is woven throughout
                    American history.</p>
            <p>For all of this, Perry has written an ambitious, thought-provoking, and important reinterpretation of
                    antebellum American culture. Historians of Jacksonian America and modern social critics will benefit
                    equally from his erudition.</p>

                    his pages to one of its subtopics, falling birthrates among northern American farmers before the
                    Civil War. His book explains why farmers chose to diminish their family sizes and why that kind of
                    fertility dropped further in the Northeast than it did in the Midwest or on frontiers.</p>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> practiced it more than did some immigrants, but immigrants and natives both used it in
                    the Northeast more than they did in midwestern and frontier areas of the North. The growing amount
                    of time that children throughout the North spent in schools added to the cost of raising them while
                    reducing the amount of work that they did for their parents. Moreover, women had an increasing
                    number of opportunities away from their families' homes; getting freedom to pursue them was
                    a reason for limiting births. After briefly examining these and other factors, Craig concludes that
                    they influenced the numbers of children families chose to have but are not "sufficient
                    explanations of the pattern of rural fertility in the early nineteenth century &amp;"
                    (p. 20).</p>
            <p>The search for "sufficient explanations" concentrates on economics, which happens
                    to be Craig's academic specialty. Readers who are uncomfortable with economics as
                    literature should be assured that the author's language is not dauntingly technical.
                    Although his tables and mathematical statements, which sometimes express ideas that would be clear
                    enough in ordinary writing, can slow the pace of reading, they do not stop it. Apart from the third
                    and last appendix, "An Economic Model of Farm Family Fertility," which really
                    demands mathematical literacy, Craig's work should be clear to everyone who is interested
                    in the history of farm people.</p>
            <p>The book emphasizes farm children's economic value to their parents. They helped to clear
                    land in new farm areas and contributed still more by helping to raise crops and produce dairy
                    products in settled country. They were also, however, "net costs to their parents in every
                    region of the antebellum North (p. 91), especially in the Northeast where the birthrate dropped
                    most. Northeastern children helped with dairying and truck gardening, specialties that grew when
                    western competition drove northeastern farmers away from grain production, but they were also
                    increasingly likely to spend their adulthoods on western farms or in urban jobs. They worked, but
                    the chance that they would be on hand to care for aging <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-090-3-106"/> farms
                    and parents declined. "So broadly speaking," Craig concludes, "the value
                    of children did correspond to East-West differences in fertility rates" (p. 104).</p>

            <p>Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant on April 9, 1865, and for five straight days
                    northerners reveled in the victory. Church bells clanged, fireworks brightened the nights, parades
                    ribboned village streets. The celebrating ceased abruptly, however, when word spread of what had
                    happened at Ford's Theatre on the night of Good Friday, April 14. With the assassination of
                    Abraham Lincoln a sudden transformation of mood gripped the nation. As northerners sought meaning in
                    that dark moment, they streamed to their churches, looking to their pastors for comfort, guidance,
                    some understanding of it all.</p>
            <p>Their pastoral needs did not go unmet. As David B. Chesebrough demonstrates in this penetrating
                    account of the preaching ministry of hundreds of Protestant clergy, congregations heard ministers
                    struggle with the irrationality of that horrific event and with the role of God within it. Like
                    Chesebrough's earlier assessment of preaching during the sectional crisis, <hi rend="i">"God Ordained This War"</hi> (1991), the present volume illustrates the value
                    of sermons as historical documents. Recognizing the vital role that preachers played as molders and
                    reflectors of nineteenth-century public opinion, Chesebrough examines 340 sermons delivered during
                    the seven passion-filled weeks after the assassination, including over a hundred hastily prepared
                    for "Black Easter," the day after the president's death. His analysis
                    provides an illuminating glimpse of public reaction to the assassination and, particularly, of the
                    impact of theology on that response.</p>
            <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-090-3-107"/>
            <p>Chesebrough organizes his findings thematically. Naturally, the predominant strain running through
                    the preachers' messages was that of grief. Unashamed to display their personal sorrow,
                    pastors identified with their parishioners' mourning. They exhibited elements of what
                    pastoral counselors call the "grief process," including the tendency to elevate
                    the deceased in mythical terms and to vent anger over the injustice of his death. Consequently,
                    preachers praised Lincoln's character, describing his "grandeur of soul"
                    (p. 171, his role as emancipator, and his similarity to Moses, who never reached the promised land
                    but led his people to it. At the same time they called for justice against the perpetrators of the
                    crime. Many saw John Wilkes Booth as but "a small cog" (p. 41) and the Confederacy
                    itself as the true murderer. Preachers' hearts hardened against southerners, and they
                    issued harsh demands for retribution. Indeed, Chesebrough contends that the northern clergy were the
                    most vindictive and punitive group in the region. Theologically, the ministers couched all these
                    views in an overarching belief that the entire tragedy should be seen as providential. In his finest
                    chapter Chesebrough delineates the many ways in which the clergy saw God's hand
                    purposefully at work in Lincoln's death.</p>
            <p>Throughout the study are some gems of historical interpretation: insightful accounts of the
                    vacillating views ministers held regarding Lincoln's presidential performance, of the
                    clergy's concern that the assassination occurred in such a sinful place as a theater, and
                    of the connections pastors drew between Lincoln's Holy Week death and America's
                    millenial vision. Although Chesebrough's desire to let the preachers speak for themselves
                    produces a myriad of lengthy quotes, and leads at times to redundancy, his inclusion of a rich
                    annotated bibliography of sermons will be a boon to scholars. In short, the volume exhibits
                    impressive research, contributes many new insights, and is a welcome addition to the growing body of
                    scholarship on Civil War religion.</p>

            <p>A tide of yellow fever washed across the American South in 1878, surging up the <geogName>Mississippi
                        Valley</geogName>, and lapping at the southern borders of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The 1870s were a decade of increasing expertise in some areas of medicine, but not in
                    this one: the mosquito vector still was unknown, preventive measures still much in debate, and the
                    panic attending mass death shackled <pb n="304" id="VAA4025-090-3-108"/> attempts to stem the
                    epidemic. Between seventeen and twenty thousand people died in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, as many as six thousand in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>, alone. More than one
                    physician echoed the traditional lay belief that this dread fever, signalled by a distinctive yellow
                    cast to the skin, was the "King of Terrors."</p>
            <p>Khaled J. Bloom has written a careful, well-informed account of this epidemic, based principally on
                    the disease's impact on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He makes good use of the many public documents produced by physicians, public health
                    officials, and city governments who tried to understand what was happening to their communities and
                    what possibly could help. Relying on these sources, along with newspaper and medical journal
                    accounts, Bloom tells a story somewhat familiar to students of epidemic disease. It is a story of
                    two intersecting plots. First, there were the competing etiological explanations of the disease
                    (insects were mentioned by some observers as possibly important, but only among a welter of other
                    speculations) and, second, the haphazard attempts to formulate government measures of control
                    (covering the streets and the trees with carbolic acid wash, for instance).</p>
            <p>Bloom's is a straight-ahead outlook in which the disease itself is the protagonist,
                    outwitting causal explanation and prevention at every turn. Indeed, at times yellow fever almost
                    seems to have a kind of intelligence of its own, so strong is Bloom's vision of its power
                    and its path through the South. This focus, while dramatic and clear, sometimes tends to draw
                    attention away from human agency. For example, the reasons why public health policy did or did not
                    change during the course of this epidemic (and a milder one that followed in 1879) are not clearly
                    explained, nor are the points of view of ordinary citizens and their physicians much discussed.
                    Although yellow fever morbidity and mortality in terms of race (as a key to the South's
                    social and cultural distinctiveness) are mentioned, they are not interpreted at length.</p>
            <p>This foreshortening of the social context for disease notwithstanding, Bloom's study rewards
                    the reader with careful research, a clear storyline, and an admirable appreciation for those in the
                    public arena who tried but failed to drive disease away.</p>

            <p>During recent years scholars have examined the American urban experience from regional perspectives
                    and have produced valuable studies of the urban South and West. Now Jon C. Teaford has focused
                    attention on the cities of the Midwest. The result is a useful book that is thoroughly researched
                    and engagingly written, although it occasionally delivers slightly less than it seems to promise.</p>
            <p>The Urban Heartland, as Teaford defines it, includes the cities in the states of the Old Northwest
                    plus <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These places, he claims, constitute "a legitimate subspecies of urban
                    life" (p. xii). To organize this large and complex subject he uses the metaphor of the life
                    cycle, tracing the region's urban development from birth ("Creating the Urban
                    Network") to old age ("The Making of the Rust Belt"). His treatment is
                    thus essentially chronological although some topical chapters permit more in-depth consideration of
                    such issues as urban culture. The author's view of the Midwest's urban life course
                    is neatly summarized when he writes: "In the decades before the Civil War, the heartland
                    cities had shared a consciousness of the interior as frontier; by 1900 they shared a sense of the
                    interior as central to American life; at the close of the 1970s they all feared an emerging vision
                    of the interior as void (p. xi).</p>
            <p>The strength of <hi rend="i">Cities of the Heartland</hi> is not the originality of the subjects
                    examined; the growth of the region's river and lake cities in the antebellum decades is a
                    well-known story, and the Rust Belt has been discussed ad nauseam. Rather, the volume is notable for
                    its breadth of coverage and the range of documentation upon which it is based. With the exception
                    noted below, Teaford draws his examples from many cities of all sizes, and his footnotes reveal that
                    he consulted a truly impressive variety of sources. Indiana cities are reasonably well represented;
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Fort

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> all receive multiple mentions, and many other Hoosier communities are listed in the
                    index. (In the index, but not the text, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">East Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> is mistakenly located in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.)</p>
            <p>But the breadth of coverage that is the book's strength is not in evidence throughout. The
                    chapter "In the Cultural Vanguard," which purports to discuss midwestern urban
                    culture during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, focuses almost exclusively on <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Granting the Windy City's importance, readers of this journal are still
                    likely to be surprised to find no mention of Bobbs-Merrill, Booth Tarkington, or <hi rend="i">The

            <p>That caveat aside, Teaford has written a valuable study that fills a glaring gap in the
                    historiography of American cities. Urban historians will want to be familiar with this book;
                    research libraries everywhere and college and public libraries in the Midwest will want to add it to
                    their collections.</p>

            <p>Katherine Jellison's <hi rend="i">Entitled to Power: Farm Women and Technology,
                        1913–1963</hi> is an important contribution to the historiography of rural women.
                    Although several historians have recently published studies on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                    rural women and sociologists and anthropologists have undertaken valuable work on rural women in
                    this century, Jellison has published the first historical monograph that focuses on
                    twentieth-century farm women in the Midwest. She maintains that by failing to study these women,
                    historians have ignored "an event that had a significant <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-090-3-112"/> impact on American social, political, cultural, and economic history: farm families'
                    adoption of twentieth-century farm, household, and communication technology" (p. xx).</p>
            <p>Jellison outlines these new developments and assesses their impact on farm families. Much of her
                    attention, however, focuses on the promotion of technological change by Country Life and
                    agricultural reformers, federal agricultural agencies and programs, farm organizations and
                    periodicals, and manufacturers and advertisers. Jellison highlights the dissonance between the
                    domestic ideology that informed the assumptions and goals of these forces and the actual lives and
                    desires of farm women. She argues that although most farm women wanted field and household
                    equipment, they rejected the idea asserted in the prescriptive literature that "adoption of
                    modern equipment would release women from their productive role on the farm and instead allow them
                    to conform more closely to the role of full-time ‘homemaker.’ Most farm women
                    did not see this as a worthwhile goal" (p. xxi). She further demonstrates that government
                    surveys of rural women, already distorted because they focused on native-born middle-class women,
                    were misinterpreted by government officials and agricultural reformers who continually failed to
                    recognize women's roles in farm production. Rightly critical of the Extension
                    Service's "artificial division of farm and home" (p. 63) and certainly
                    accurate in emphasizing that the home demonstration agents focused on the promotion of household
                    equipment and improved homemaking techniques, Jellison fails to acknowledge the extent to which the
                    "Home Ec" clubs, established to provide forums for these lessons, were
                    extraordinarily valuable in relieving rural isolation, promoting friendship and sisterhood, and
                    increasing members' self-esteem.</p>
            <p>Although specialized, mechanized, and capital-intensive agriculture triumphed and the rural
                    patriarchal structure persisted, Jellison maintains that women continued their roles in agricultural
                    production and their resistance to roles as full-time homemakers. These roles were reshaped by
                    technology, and Jellison is sensitive to the disparate impact of technology and the ways in which
                    the variables of geography, type and size of farming operation, socioeconomic status, family
                    relationships, and expectations influenced the choices families made. She notes, for example, that
                    "the adoption of mechanized farming prompted some farm families to involve wives and
                    daughters in field work to a greater extent" but in others men took over more of this work,
                    "perhaps eliminating the work of women and girls altogether but also reducing the need for
                    hired men" (p. 109).</p>
            <p>Jellison's study is well grounded in all the relevant secondary literature and reflects
                    effective use of a variety of government documents, advertisements in print media and on radio, and
                    women's letters to government officials and their comments in government <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-090-3-113"/> surveys. Her reliance on the journal <hi rend="i">Wallaces'
                        Farmer</hi> and its columnist Elizabeth Wherry seems excessive, however, and suggests the need
                    to consider a wider range of farm periodicals. Jellison has also used very few individual manuscript
                    collections of women's letters and diaries and has not relied much on oral histories of
                    rural women's life experiences. Consulting these sources would have enhanced what is
                    already a fine monograph and a most impressive addition to twentieth-century women's
                    history and the history of rural life.</p>

            <p>"Photographic Remembrance" is an accurate description of E. Frank
                    Stephenson's goal in the writing and layout of <hi rend="i">Gatling</hi>. In a brief
                    narrative the author remembers his youth spent on and around the Gatling Plantation. He gives a
                    historical sketch of the Gatling family, including its most famous member, Dr. Richard Jordan
                    Gatling. One might have wished for a bit more detail about the circumstances surrounding the
                    invention of the Gatling gun in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The most striking features of this small book are its photographs and drawings. Taken as a whole,
                    they tell a story all their own of another time and of an extraordinary family of inventors and
                    visionaries. Stephenson has made every effort to document the sources and contents of the
                    illustrations that he selected. Photographs related to Gatling's wedding (which took place
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>) and death are supplemented by moving eyewitness accounts.</p>
            <p>Readers who are unfamiliar with Gatling's life will be surprised to see patent drawings for
                    a variety of inventions besides the gun that bears his name. Among his more than fifty patents were
                    a bicycle, tractor, motorized plow, and flush toilet. Stephenson is to be commended for reminding
                    readers of this inventive genius who "conceived the idea of mitigating the horrors of war
                    by a more deadly weapon than any one then in use" (p. 83). Perhaps this gentle reminder
                    will spawn a much-deserved full biography of Richard Jordan Gatling.</p>
