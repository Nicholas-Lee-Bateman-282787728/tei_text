                <head>PREFACE.</head>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to inform my readers that the title
                    of this Poem (âThe Child of the Islandsâ) has reference to His Royal Highness
                    the Prince of Wales.</p>
                <p>Had I been able to carry out my original plan, the volume now published would
                    have appeared on the 9th of November, 1842, being the first anniversary of the
                    birth of His Royal Highness. The recurrence of domestic affliction, in two
                    consecutive autumns, compelled me to relinquish the literary tasks in which I
                    was engaged; and I abandoned all thoughts of publishing at that particular
                    time.</p>
                <p>I hope and believe that this enforced delay<pb n="x" xml:id="VAB7034-004"/> has
                    been favourable to the work, by enabling me to correct much that seemed crude
                    and imperfect in the treatment of my subject. To the subject itself, the date is
                    of little importance. The Child of the Islands was chosen, not as the theme of a
                    Birthday Ode, or Address of Congratulation, but as the most complete existing
                    type of a peculiar class--a class born into a world of very various destinies,
                    with all the certainty human prospects can give, of enjoying the blessings of
                    this life, without incurring any of its privations. I desired to contrast that
                    brightness with the shadow that lies beyond and around. In the brief space of
                    time since this poem was commenced, there has been great evidence of increasing
                    attention to the sufferings, and to the <emph>endurance</emph>, of the lower
                    classes. Much has been said--and something hass been done. Inquiries have been
                    instituted; measures of relief have<pb n="xi" xml:id="VAB7034-005"/> been
                    passed; voice after voice, and spirit after spirit, among the noble-hearted and
                    influential, have risen to support the cause of the helpless; till the reign of
                    Victoria bids fair to claim a more hallowed glory than that which encircled the
                    âGolden Ageâ of Elizabeth. The Feeble are calling (not vainly) on the Strong;
                    the hoarse wail of the shipwrecked is answered by a cheer of promise from the
                    shore; men's hearts have been roused, and are listening as to the sound of a
                    rallying cry.</p>
                <p>It is true that, had I intended merely to illustrate the Difference of Condition,
                    I might have chosen from among those who have heaped up riches or climbed to
                    power. I selected the Prince of Wales as my illustration, because the innocence
                    of his age, the hopes that hallow his birth, and the hereditary loyalty which
                    clings to the throne, concur in enabling men of all parties, and<pb n="xii" xml:id="VAB7034-006"/> of every grade in society, to contemplate such a
                    type, not only without envy or bitterness, but with one common feeling of
                    earnest good-will. There are none, however sore their own battle with Adversity,
                    who will refuse to join in applying to âThe Child of the Islandsâ the wish so
                    beautifully expressed by our Minstrel-poet, Moore: <q>
                        <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                            <l>âAs half in shade, and half in sun,</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">This world along its course advances,</l>
                            <l>May that side the Sun's upon</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">Be all that shall ever meet thy glances!â</l>
                        </lg>
                    </q></p>
                <p>Nor will the presence of this good-will weaken the contrast or destroy the
                    argument. It is, on the contrary, a gleam of that union and kindliness of
                    feeling between the Higher and Lower Classes, which it is the main object of the
                    writer of these pages (and of far better, wiser, and more powerful writers,) to
                    inculcate; a gleam which may fade into darkness or brighten into sunshine,<pb n="xiii" xml:id="VAB7034-007"/> but which no one who attentively observes
                    the present circumstances of this country, can believe will remain
                    unaltered.</p>
                <p>I shall only add, that I have endeavoured to profit by the criticisms and
                    suggestions made on former occasions, and that I hope the indulgence so often
                    extended to me as an author, will not be withheld from this poem. I can truly
                    copy the plea of quaint John Bunyan with respect to its pages, and say, <q>
                        <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                            <l>âIt came from mine own heart,--so, to my head,</l>
                            <l>And thence into my fingers tricklÃ«d;</l>
                            <l>Then, to my pen,â--</l>
                        </lg>
                    </q> and if I have executed my task imperfectly, it has not been for lack of
                    earnest feeling in the cause which I have attempted to advocate.</p>

                            <p>The murder of Mr. Drummond, on the 20th of January, 1843, by D.
                                Macnaughten, is probably still fresh in the memory of our
                                readers:--</p>
                            <p>âAfter having been in attendance on Sir Robert Peel at the Privy
                                Council Office, Mr. Drummond called at the bank to see his brother,
                                and he left it again about four o'clock. As he was walking along
                                close by the Salopian Coffee-house, a man was seen to present a
                                pistol at him, and discharge it. He then drew another from his
                                breast, but was seized by a policeman; and in the struggle the
                                pistol went off while pointed downwards. Mr. Drummond, being wounded
                                by the first discharge, staggered, and would have fallen, but was
                                supported by a bystander, and with some difficulty he walked back to
                                the bank. Mr. Jackson, an apothecary, was promptly in attendance on
                                the wounded man; and he was without delay removed to his own house
                                in Grosvenor Street, Grosvenor Square, where he died on the
                                25th.â</p>
                            <p>Macnaughten was tried for the murder:--</p>
                            <p>âThe evidence for the prosecution occupied an entire day, and the
                                case was adjourned. On the following day, Mr. Cockburn addressed the
                                jury at great length, resting the defence upon the plea of insanity.
                                He described the nature of the clear and positive evidence which he
                                should adduce on this point; and proceeded to examine the
                                law-authorities on the subject,--the opinion of Lord Hale, and the
                                cases of Lord Ferrers, Hatfield, Bellingham, and others, contending
                                that modern science had thrown so much light upon the organisation
                                of the brain and its morbid condition, that the doctrine of the
                                bench at earlier times must be received with caution. With regard to
                                the case of Bellingham, who had been executed for the murder of Mr.
                                Perceval, the general opinion now seemed to be, that the verdict in
                                that case had been improperly obtained. Bellingham had been tried
                                and executed only a week after the crime was committed; and it
                                appeared that the application of his counsel to have the trial
                                postponed had been refused, but that witnesses would have been ready
                                to come forward, if the application had been granted, to make out
                                decidedly the plea of insanity. In the case of Bowler, who had been
                                subject to epileptic fits, and manifested all the<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7034-203"/> indications of insanity, the prisoner was
                                executed; and at the trial of Oxford, Baron Alderson remarked,
                                âBowler was executed, I believe; and very barbarous it was.â The
                                Scotch authorities had taken a more humane view of the law. It was,
                                for instance, the opinion of Mr. Baron Hume, that though a man might
                                be in general conscious that murder was a crime, and yet commit a
                                particular murder under the influence of some unaccountable
                                delusion, he could not be held morally responsible for the crime.
                                The true nature of the delusion which exempted from crime had been
                                admirably laid down by Lord Erskine, who said, in his defence of
                                Hatfield, that insanity might prevail upon a particular point, and
                                that monomania exculpated an individual from the guilt of crime
                                committed under its influence. Mr. Ray likewise held that a man
                                might be as sane as the rest of the world on all points but one, and
                                yet that an act committed under that particular delusion was one for
                                which the man was no more answerable than if <emph>all</emph> his
                                mental faculties had been deranged.â</p>
                            <p>Macnaughten was acquitted:--</p>
                            <p>âAnd, in consequence of the manner in which the trial terminated, and
                                the strong expression of public feeling which it excited, it was
                                determined by the House of Lords to refer certain questions to the
                                judges on the state of the law relating to crimes committed by
                                persons supposed to be insane or afflicted with
                                    monomania.â--<title>Annual Register</title>, 1843.</p>

                            <p>In the autumn of 1843, I found two boys who had run away from home
                                lying on some steps near a church; the younger was in such a state
                                of exhaustion, that he could neither eat nor stand. After they had
                                rested and slept at my house, I sent them home; and, as the elder
                                boy seemed in great dread of the punishment which would be inflicted
                                by his father, I wrote, advising that the wretched little wanderers
                                (the least of whom was but six years of age) should receive a âfree
                                pardonâ on their arrival. The father, a poor labouring man, heard my
                                letter read in silence, held out his hand to the boy, and said that,
                                in consequence of what had been written, he would not punish him.
                                The mother, to use the language of the man to whose care I had
                                entrusted them, âfolded them up in her arms, over and over, and
                                cried a good deal, before she spoke; then she said, âOh, my dears, I
                                thought I'd seen the last of your two faces!ââ</p>

                                punisher of vice, men naturally expect to find the constant and
                                univocal marks of such an <pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7034-204"/>
                                administration. But the history of mankind, nay, even of every one's
                                own neighbourhood, would soon inform the most indiligent observer,
                                that the affairs of men wear a face of great irregularity; the scene
                                that ever and anon presents itself being of distressed virtue and
                                prosperous wickedness; which unavoidably brings the embarrassed
                                religionist to the necessity of giving up his belief, or finding out
                                the solution of these untoward appearances. His first reflection
                                might be with the poet Claudian:-- <q>

                                harmony of the material universe, taught him that there must needs
                                be a superintending providence to influence that order which all its
                                parts preserve, for the sake of the whole, in their continued
                                revolutions, would soon instruct him in the absurdity of supposing
                                that the same care did not extend to man, a creature of a far nobler
                                nature than the most considerable of inanimate beings. And therefore
                                human affairs not being dispensed at present agreeably to that
                                superintendence, he must conclude, that man shall exist after death,
                                and be brought to a future reckoning in another life, where all
                                accounts will be set even, and all the present obscurities and
                                perplexities in the ways of providence unfolded and explained. From

                            <p>Lord Ashley's Bill has in a great measure done away with the horrors
                                attendant on the employment of children in coal-mines. If there were
                                not, still existing, employments almost as injurious and as
                                melancholy in their effects, this passage might have been omitted;
                                but the subject of the excessive labour performed by children in
                                England, is one of which the details are so startling as to be
                                scarcely credible. When Lord Ashley moved for leave to bring in his
                                Bill, he briefly quoted the statements of the Report with respect to
                                the ages of the children employed:--ââIn South Staffordshire,
                                Shropshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and Cumberland, children
                                begin to work at seven years of age; about Halifax, Bradford, and
                                Leeds, at six; in Derbyshire and South Durham, at five or six; in
                                Lancashire, at five; and near Oldham, as early as four; and, in some
                                small collieries of the last neighbourhood, some children are
                                brought to<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7034-205"/> work in their
                                bed-gowns. In North Durham and Northumberland, many children are
                                employed at five or six, but not generally; that age is common in
                                the east of Scotland; in the west of Scotland, eight; in South
                                Wales, four is a very usual age; in South Gloucestershire, nine, or
                                younger; in North Somersetshire, six or seven. In the south of
                                Ireland, no children at all are employed. All the underground work,
                                which in the coal-mines of England, Scotland, and Wales, is done by
                                young children, appears in Ireland to be done by young persons
                                between the ages of thirteen and eighteen.â</p>
                            <p>What the work of a âtrapperâ was, may be shewn in the following
                                extracts from the Parliamentary Reports:--</p>
                            <p>âThe air-door boy, or trapper, commonly the youngest person employed
                                in the mine, has the charge of a door placed in a road, along which
                                horses, men, and boys, are constantly passing, but through which it
                                is essential to the ventilation of the mine to prevent the current
                                of air from the downcast shaft from passing, in order that this
                                current may be forced round the other roads and workings of the pit.
                                The duty of the trapper is to open this door for persons who have
                                occasion to pass through it, and then to shut it again as quickly as
                                possible; and on his keeping this door constantly shut, excepting at
                                the moment when persons are passing through it, the safety of the
                                mine, and the lives of the persons employed in it, entirely
                                depend.</p>
                            <p>âThe trappers sit in a little hole scooped out for them in the side
                                of the gates behind each door, where they sit with a string in their
                                hands attached to the door, and pull it open the moment they hear
                                the corves (i.e. carriages for conveying the coal) at hand, and the
                                moment it has passed they let the door fall to, which it does of its
                                own weight. If any thing impedes the shutting of the door they
                                remove it; or, if unable to do so, run to the nearest man to get him
                                to do it for them. They have nothing else to do; but, as their
                                office must be performed from the repassing of the first to the
                                passing of the last corve during the day, they are in the pit the
                                whole time it is worked, <emph>frequently above twelve hours
                                    a-day</emph>. They sit, moreover, in the dark, often with a damp
                                floor to stand on, and exposed necessarily to draughts. It is a most
                                painful thing to contemplate the dull, dungeon-like life these
                                little creatures are doomed to spend--a life, for the most part,
                                passed in solitude, damp, and darkness. They are allowed no light;
                                    <emph>but sometimes a good-natured collier will bestow a little
                                    bit of candle on them as a treat</emph>. On one occasion, as I
                                was passing a little trapper, he begged me for a little grease from
                                my candle. I found that the poor child had scooped out a hole in a
                                great stone, and, having obtained a wick, had <emph>manufactured a
                                    rude sort of lamp</emph>; and that he kept it going as well as
                                he could by begging contributions of melted tallow from the candles
                                of any Samaritan passers-by. To be in the dark, in fact, seemed to
                                be the great grievance with all of them. Occasionally, they are so
                                posted as to be near the shaft, where they can sometimes run and
                                enliven themselves with a view of the corves going up with the
                                coals; or, perhaps, occasionally with a bird's-eye peep at the
                                daylight itself; their main amusement is that, however, of seeing
                                the corves pass along the gates at their posts. When we consider the
                                very trifling cost at which these little<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7034-206"/> creatures might be supplied with a light,
                                as is the case in the Cumberland collieries, there are few things
                                which more strongly indicate the neglect of their comfort than the
                                fact of their being kept in darkness--of all things the most
                                wearisome to a young child.</p>
                            <p>âJohn Saville, seven years old, collier's boy at the soap-pit,
                                Sheffield: âI stand and open and shut the door; I'm generally in the
                                dark, and sit me down against the door; I stop twelve hours in the
                                pit; I never see daylight now, except on Sundays; I fell asleep one
                                day, and a corve ran over my leg and made it smart; they'd squeeze
                                me against the door if I fall to sleep again.â Sarah Gooder, aged
                                eight years: âI'm a trapper in the Gauber Pit; I have to trap
                                without a light, and I'm scared; I go at four and sometimes
                                half-past three in the morning, and come out at five and half-past;
                                I never go to sleep. <emph>Sometimes I sing when I've light, but not
                                    in the dark; I dare not sing then</emph>. I don't like being in
                                the pit; I am very sleepy when I go sometimes in the morning.â James
                                Sanderson, eight years old: âI am a trapper; I sit in the dark all
                                the day, or I run to the bottom of the pit and come back.â Samuel
                                Hirst, aged nine years and four months, Jump Pit: âI sit by myself;
                                I never have a light; I sit still all day long, and never do any
                                thing except open and shut the door.â</p>
                            <p>âWilliam Martin, not ten years old, Messrs. Houldsworth's Colliery:
                                âI trap two doors; I never see the daylight except on Sundays.ââ</p>
                            <p>There is something not only touching, but (to those who think
                                seriously) awful and striking, in the fate thus simply told, and the
                                struggle of the soul against it. The intelligence of the child who
                                âmanufactured a rude sort of lamp;â the quenchless gaiety of the
                                other (a little girl), who âsometimes sangâ when she had
                                light!--what can poetry add to such descriptions?</p>

                            <p>This âwant of lightâ is too often the fate of the poor under other
                                circumstances. Not once, but in countless instances, I have been
                                told by the poor of this; of the long dreary nights when they had to
                                âwaitâ for light, in pain and anguish, being unable to afford even
                                the rush taper, which would have been such a comfort. On one
                                occasion a man told me he thought his wife had got better and gone
                                to sleep, but in the morning, âwhen the light came,â he saw she had
                                âgone to sleep for good.â I have remembered these instances in
                                lighted ball-rooms, and connected them with a striking passage in
                                St. FranÃ§ois de Sale's âIntroduction Ã  la Vie DÃ©vote:â--</p>

                            <p>A year or two has elapsed since the interference of the police and
                                vigilance of inspectors forced on the public mind the painful fact,
                                that after the driving, riding, and gay lounging of Hyde Park and
                                Kensington Gardens were over for the day, those places of
                                fashionable resort became, for the night, a sort of temporary
                                ârefuge for the destitute,â the houseless and homeless creeping into
                                the trees and gravel-pits for shelter, and sleeping there. A
                                gentleman, who signed himself âAnti-Humbug,â published a letter
                                stating his belief that the parties who slept there were principally
                                robbers and women of bad character, who not only were unworthy of
                                compassion, but passed the night there by preference. His opinion
                                did not become general, and the result of the fact becoming known
                                was the establishment of several ârefugesâ in different parts of the
                                metropolis, which afford shelter to those who see night coming on
                                without having the means to secure a lodging. Many of those who have
                                availed themselves of this temporary assistance have been persons of
                                education and respectability, who had, indeed, seen âbetter
                                days.â</p>

                            <p>âWith an enthusiasm never excelled, this extraordinary man, who went
                                to the United States a poor and unfriended Scotch weaver, first
                                taught himself, at the age of forty years, to draw and colour after
                                nature, then applied himself to the study of various branches of
                                knowledge, and, having acquired the power of writing clearly and
                                elegantly, as well as of depicting by his pencil what he saw in his
                                rambles, set out to penetrate through the vast territory of the
                                United States, undeterred by forests and swamps, for the sole
                                purpose of painting and describing the native birds. During seven
                                years, in which he prosecuted this undertaking, he travelled more
                                than ten thousand miles, âa solitary, exploring pilgrim,â as he
                                describes himself. His labours were rewarded with no worldly riches
                                or honours, for he had the greatest difficulty in procuring
                                subscribers for his splendid work, and, when a bookseller at last
                                undertook to print and publish it, <emph>the only remuneration which
                                    the author received was a payment for the mechanical labour of
                                    colouring his own plates</emph>. But his soul was set upon the
                                one object of his life--that of giving a complete account of one of
                                the most interesting portions of the works of the Creator, as far as
                                the vast continent of North America afforded him opportunities for
                                diligent examination; and he passionately pursued his inquiry into
                                the history of birds.â--<bibl><author>RENNIE'S</author>

                            <p>I can recollect seeing, when I was a child, one of the most
                                celebrated beauties of the gipsy race--a woman of the name of
                                Charlotte Stanley, whose portrait was painted by Sir Thomas
                                Lawrence, and engravings made from it. Her hair,<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7034-209"/> (which hung in long glossy ringlets of
                                raven black,) she assured us she curled by twisting it round a hot
                                tobacco-pipe. She said she could not sleep in a house; that she
                                could not breathe freely; that she should die if she were obliged to
                                give up her wandering life. In former days attempts had been made to
                                induce her to do so, and an offer made to allow her a cottage
                                rent-free; but the daughter of Ishmael continued a vagrant by
                                preference. At the time I saw her she was still beautiful. She had a
                                husband (who savagely ill-treated her, and was, I believe, hung for
                                sheep-stealing) and several children.</p>

                            <p>I had, accidentally, an opportunity of hearing Father Mathew during
                                his stay in England, and have rarely been more impressed than by the
                                scene I then witnessed. Having heard many arguments as to the amount
                                of good likely to result from his efforts in behalf of temperance, I
                                cannot help repeating here an observation I made at the
                                time,--namely, that, without exception, all the persons I then saw,
                                took the Temperance Vow apparently as a step towards a general
                                reformation of previous evil courses, and not simply as a vow
                                against drunkenness. All the persuasion exercised by those who
                                wished relations or friends to take it, were based on this notion.
                                As I stood in the crowd, I heard perpetually sentences that
                                contained in themselves the pith of a hundred arguments. âOh, take
                                it, John, take it, and you'll not lose your work anymore!â âTake it,
                                take it, and home 'ill be what it was!â âTake it, and, by the Lord's
                                blessing, you'll not be tempted!â I saw a girl there, who told me
                                she was twenty that day, and âhad been drunk most nights since she
                                was sixteen.â I never beheld a stronger expression of
                                    <emph>prayer</emph> in a human countenance, than when she knelt
                                in the semicircular group surrounding the platform from which Father
                                Mathew and others addressed the people. It was an affecting
                                sceneâaffecting from the quiet simplicity and sincerity of the
                                reverend father's eloquence, and from the earnest and often tearful
                                attention with which his words were received. He has the advantage
                                not only of a very clear and sweet voice, but of a style
                                particularly suited to uneducated listeners, inasmuch as he indulges
                                in none of the long, involved, oratorical sentences, which the poor,
                                who never read, are unable to follow, or to comprehend. It was with
                                very deep regret that I lately heard that Father Mathew had become
                                involved in pecuniary difficulties, on account of his endeavours to
                                pluck out by the roots, and by the aid of a religious vow, that vice
                                which the poor themselves so frankly admit to be the cause of almost
                                every error they commit. I saw a sonâa hale, ruddy, honest-looking
                                workman, persuade his father, and lift his cap off as he knelt down.
                                I saw many women persuade their husbands; and, in one single
                                instance, I saw a young woman try to persuade a sister or companion
                                without effect. She tried very earnestly, and spoke very sensibly:
                                the other, who was also young and very good-looking, answered
                                scoffingly and in bad language. While they were <choice>

                                </choice><pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7034-210"/> cussing the matter, the
                                blessing was pronounced; the <emph>persuader</emph> sank on her
                                knees (as did the persons immediately round), the girl she had
                                addressed remained standing; and I can vividly recall her
                                companion's look of sorrowful reproach, which seemed to imply that
                                her standing was a sort of moral exile from those about her, and
                                from the good work going on.</p>

                            <p>For a detailed account of Parkhurst Prison, I would refer my readers
                                to No. 449 and No. 601 of âChambers's Edinburgh Journal,â--a paper
                                containing more combined instruction and amusement than any other
                                that I know, professing to be conducted on the same plan. I have
                                abridged part of the account given there, and have added some
                                particulars obtained from the kind-hearted and excellent Captain
                                Woollcombe himself, when I visited the prison in the autumn of 1842.
                                The correspondent of âChambers's Journalâ says:--</p>
                            <p>âThe streets of no city in Holland, Belgium, Germany, and France,
                                that I have seen, exhibit such a crew of dirty and miserable-looking
                                little wretches as are to be seen daily in London, Edinburgh,
                                Dublin, Glasgow, and other large seats of population, and whose
                                almost homeless and lawless condition is a positive scandal to the
                                community. Falling, as a matter of course, into the commission of
                                petty delinquencies, they again and again figure before magistrates
                                in the police-courts, and, improving as they proceed, by a vicious
                                system of imprisonment, they in due time âwork their way,â as it is
                                called, to the bar of the Old Bailey, the Court of Justiciary, or
                                some other of the higher tribunals.</p>
                            <p>âFor a number of years back, it has not been customary to hang boys.
                                The practice terminated with the reign of George III. Since that
                                period, they have more usually been sent to the prison at
                                Millbank,--to the Hulks in the Thames, where they have been
                                compelled to work in a condition worse than that of brutes,--or
                                transported to New South Wales, where they were assigned as slaves.
                                In only a few instances, and these of a peculiarly favourable
                                nature, have the convicts been reclaimed, instructed, or improved;
                                the greater proportion having been turned loose on society, at home
                                or abroad, much more deeply sunk in moral depravity than at the
                                commencement of their course of servitude. Latterly, an immense
                                improvement has been effected in the disposal of young male
                                convicts. Instead of being permanently lodged in any penal
                                establishments of the old stamp, they are, according to the judgment
                                of the Secretary of State, sent to a prison or penitentiary in the
                                Isle of Wight,â (now called Parkhurst Prison.)</p>
                            <p>âThis establishment, which externally resembles a large suite of
                                barracks for soldiers, inclosed with a lofty wall, is situated on
                                the face of a rising piece of ground, about a mile and a half north
                                from Newport, on the road to Cowes; and is, therefore, favourably
                                placed, as respects both salubrity and convenience.<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7034-211"/> There is also an advantage in its being
                                placed on an island, as the chance of escape and connivance is by
                                that means very materially lessened. For reasons which require no
                                explanation, there is no indiscriminate admittance of strangers to
                                see the interior; and it was only by an order from the Home Office,
                                communicated to the governor, that I was enabled to make the visit
                                which I desired.</p>
                            <p>âCaptain Woollcombe, a gentleman who had for some years retired from
                                active service, and engaged himself in benevolent plans of juvenile
                                instruction on a private estate, had then the command of the
                                institution, as governor and director.â (It is now in other
                                hands.)</p>
                            <p>âThe institution, as I learned, was first opened for the reception of
                                inmates in December 1838, and, in the course of twelve months, the
                                number sent to it was 157. At the time of my visit there were 180,
                                and the accommodation will eventually admit 320. All the prisoners
                                are boys from nine to sixteen years of age, the greater proportion,
                                apparently, being from about eleven to thirteen, or of that age and
                                appearance usually seen at day-schools. Each boy, on entering, is
                                dressed in a coarse grey suit, with his number and the letters P.P.
                                strongly marked on the breast. The objects sought to be attained by
                                the course of treatment are twofold:--the penal correction of the
                                boy, with a view to deter, not himself only, but juvenile offenders
                                generally, from the commission of crime; and the moral reformation
                                of the culprit.</p>
                            <p>âCaptain Woollcombe's exertions, in the prosecution of this arduous
                                and important work, have been ably supported by the Rev. Thomas
                                England, who acts as chaplain.</p>
                            <p>Nearly one-half the number of boys were from London, and the
                                remainder from the rest of England, with the exception of eleven
                                from Scotland, one from the Isle of Man, and two from Quebec. Theft
                                by house-breaking, and larceny, were generally the crimes for which
                                they had been ultimately sentenced. Three were under sentence of
                                fifteen years' transportation, one for fourteen years, fourteen for
                                ten years, one hundred and fifteen for seven years, and one for five
                                years; one for three years' imprisonment, thirteen for two years,
                                one for eighteen months, two for twelve months, and two for six
                                months. It is not proposed, I believe, to retain any of the
                                prisoners beyond two or three years at Parkhurst, in which period,
                                it is presumed, they will have been reclaimed from their evil
                                propensities.</p>
                            <p>âThe teaching of the boys some useful kind of trade, or labour, by
                                which they may earn an honest subsistence on returning to society,
                                is one of the most admirable arrangements connected with the
                                institution. The trades now in regular course of teaching in the
                                prison are those of tailors and shoemakers. Such painting and
                                whitewashing as have been required have been done by the prisoners,
                                as, also, some carpenters' work; but the latter occupation, as well
                                as that of the smith's work, presents many temptations to criminal
                                boys, in the use of tools for improper purposes, and, if carried to
                                any extent, might cause much difficulty, by want of a regular supply
                                of work. Tailoring and shoemaking are not open to these objections,
                                and at these trades eighty-four boys are now (or were lately)
                                employed for a few hours daily. The time allotted to out-door<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7034-212"/> labour, either on the land
                                attached to the prison or within the walls, as occasion may require,
                                is about two hours every afternoon, except in wet weather, when the
                                boys are employed in such work inside the prison as can be provided,
                                such as cutting and tying wood for lighting fires, making mops from
                                old junk for prison uses, &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>âBeing conducted into the work-rooms, I was shewn a pile of jackets
                                and other articles of attire, and also a quantity of shoes, all
                                which had been made by the boys, and seemed of good workmanship.
                                Captain Woollcombe expected shortly to be able to undertake a
                                contract for clothing for the army.â</p>
                            <p>This was in 1840. In 1843, the same journal again resumes the
                                subject:--</p>
                            <p>âThe report presented to parliament of the condition of this prison
                                during the year 1842 is highly gratifying. Since its formation in
                                1838, the system adopted for reforming and instructing, rather than
                                punishing, juvenile culprits, has been steadily and most
                                successfully carried out. The number of prisoners during the past
                                year was 375, of ages varying from between eight and ten, to between
                                eighteen and twenty-one years. They were divided into two classes,
                                according to their aptitude for learning and practising various
                                trades; and although, at the formation of the establishment, it was
                                found inexpedient to intrust the prisoners with the dangerous tools
                                of the carpenter, &amp;c., this restriction no longer exists; and
                                during the past year classes of carpenters, sawyers, coopers, and
                                bricklayers, have been formed under superintending tradesmen of each
                                class, in addition to the tailors and shoemakers at work from the
                                first. The proficiency attained by these classes has been
                                satisfactory, and, in some cases, beyond expectation. The young
                                sawyers have cut up 37,636 superficial feet of timber, felled from
                                the prison lands. The elder and strongest boys only can be employed
                                as sawyers; their proficiency in work is reported to be good, many
                                of them being able to measure and line the timber preparatory to
                                cutting it.</p>
                            <p>âCircumstances have prevented more than ten prisoners being
                                instructed in the cooper's art; and although they only commenced
                                work in July last, they made, by December, 483 articles well enough
                                to be received into her majesty's stores, for the use of the public
                                service.</p>
                            <p>âThe twelvemonth's work of the tailors produced 6242 garments; the
                                shoemakers made 2206 pairs of shoes, and thirty-one leather caps.
                                The greatest portion of the clothes and shoes have been applied to
                                the convict service; some for home consumption at Parkhurst, and the
                                rest for boys embarked from the prison for the colonies. Besides
                                handicraft, agricultural labour is carried on by the Parkhurst
                                prisoners, upon a farm belonging to the establishment. Good
                                quantities of oats, hay, potatoes, &amp;c., were produced in spite
                                of a dry season, and other disadvantages; and four acres of recently
                                reclaimed land were cropped with turnips, oats, and potatoes. The
                                stock on this miniature farm is small, but quite adequate to
                                teaching the prisoners various matters of management connected with
                                cattle and other live stock.</p>
                            <p>âAs regards improvement, of 119 admitted in 1838, 108 have, up to
                                this time conducted themselves well, and are in a very hopeful
                                state.</p>
                            <p>âOf 116 prisoners admitted in 1840, the report is equally favourable.
                                By the<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7034-213"/> table of the state of the
                                schools on the 31st December, 1842, we find that, out of 240
                                prisoners, the conduct of 116 of them had been good, 104
                                indifferent, but only twenty decidedly bad.</p>
                            <p>âThe chief difficulty which the authorities feel, is to know what to
                                do with the discharged prisoners when thoroughly reformed. By a wise
                                regulation, the government have pardoned several deserving
                                prisoners, upon the condition that they emigrate to one of our free
                                colonies, providing them with a suitable outfit. Of the prisoners
                                removed during the past year, 110 have been discharged under such
                                pardon. They quitted the prison in a very becoming state of mind,
                                truly grateful for the boon granted to them. Two have been pardoned
                                unconditionally, and restored to their friends, their health being
                                unequal to the active labour required in the colonies. The short
                                sentences of two others having expired, they were also discharged.
                                Sixteen have been transported as incorrigible, as provided by the
                                regulations of the prison; and three have been removed by authority
                                of the Home-Office, as unfit for colonial life: they were deficient
                                in moral and mental power, and diseased in body. Only two deaths
                                have occurred from the commencement of the establishment, and they
                                took place last year.â</p>
                            <p>In proof of the ignorance in which these little criminals are often
                                found, we have the Government Report of 1844, which states
                                that,--</p>
                            <p>âSince the opening of that prison, 596 persons, whose ages vary from
                                eleven to twenty, have been admitted; and the following statistics
                                exhibit their comparative attainments:-- <table>

                            <p>âIt thus appears that only 21 out of the 596 were able to read well,
                                and only 7 to write well. Scarcely any of them had any knowledge of
                                Scripture, the meaning of words, or general information; and upwards
                                of 100 were altogether without instruction.â</p>
                            <p>In proof of the natural intelligence of these neglected creatures,
                                and of their capacity for instruction, Captain Woollcombe told me
                                many interesting anecdotes. They had, at first, been allowed to
                                correspond at intervals with their relatives; and the permission to
                                write was looked upon as a sort of reward for steady conduct. The
                                practice, however, of sending these letters was discontinued, the
                                accounts of the prison given by the young convicts being so
                                favourable that they seemed to be better off than those who had
                                committed no crime. The letters, though not sent, were occasionally
                                written; nor were the young prisoners aware<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7034-214"/> that they never would reach the parties
                                for whom they were intended. Some few of them I read; and one, in
                                particular, addressed by the boy to his mother, affected me to
                                tears; so full was it of protestations of amendment, of exultation
                                at having learned a trade, and of assurances that he would support
                                her in her old age, when his imprisonment should be over. The letter
                                was not to go; the boy was not to return. The termination of his
                                imprisonment was to be exile from his native country,--a just, a
                                necessary exile; but that did not make his letter the less touching.
                                I may here state, on Captain Woollcombe's authority, that the
                                    <emph>mothers</emph> of these boys almost always wrote them
                                letters of advice and consolation; the fathers seldom, in
                                comparison; but many of the children had been driven to crime by the
                                neglect and cruelty of step-mothers. I asked if they were very
                                unhappy; and was assured that the great mass were not the least so,
                                but that, on the other hand, there was no doubt that <emph>a
                                    few</emph> were <emph>heart-broken</emph>. The ties of home, in
                                many instances, retain their influence. One apparently hardened
                                little fellow, who swore and played the bully on coming into the
                                prison, nevertheless sank down in tears on being talked to of âhis
                                little sister.â This boy retained sufficient merriment and
                                ingenuity, in his state of punishment, to contrive a caricature of
                                the man who superintended the tailors' board and taught the boys
                                tailors' work, by cutting a figure of a man riding a donkey, out of
                                the cloth of two contrasted colours used for the prison dresses. I
                                saw this figure, in which the eyes were worked with black and white
                                thread, and which was very neatly executed. This signal act of
                                audacity was discovered in consequence of a general laugh from his
                                little fellow-convicts. Governor Woollcombe took much pains with
                                this boy; he was intelligent, improved rapidly, reformed, and went
                                to the colonies under favourable circumstances. Besides this
                                memorable donkey-and-rider, of prison-cloth, I was shewn various
                                rude carvings, similar to those used for umbrella and cane handles,
                                scraped and carved with pocket-knives, out of the bones left at the
                                boy's dinner on âmeat days.â As I stood in that court-yard full of
                                juvenile felons, I asked whether they manifested in truth more
                                corrupted dispositions than usual. Captain Woollcombe then said he
                                did not think there were more bad boys than in any other large
                                school, and that he regretted that the establishment was called a
                                    <hi>PRISON</hi>, that originally it was called the Reformatory,
                                and that he was sorry the name had been altered. I cannot better
                                conclude this note than by presenting to the reader a poem copied
                                    <foreign xml:lang="lat">verbatim</foreign> as composed by one of
                                these young convicts. In itself, it is a poor and prosaic ballad, in
                                doggerel verse; but the circumstances of its authorship may give it
                                the same interest in the eyes of others, which it had for me. The
                                lad whose death it laments, was a fellow-prisoner, who was returned
                                when dying of consumption, to his friends:-- <q>

                                without correction or erasure; and was composed by one of the
                                condemned boys in the prison at Parkhurst, Isle of Wight.</p>

                            </q>
                            <p>The one blot in the plan of this excellent institution, was the
                                occasional infliction of solitary confinement; a punishment dreadful
                                at any age, and as dangerous as inhuman when acting on a young mind.
                                A very melancholy case occurred at Parkhurst, in which the boy's
                                untoward violence amounted almost to madness, and he pulled down
                                portions of the plastering on the wall of his cell. This boy was
                                afterwards insane, and died in the hospital there. I cannot state at
                                what interval from his confinement this took place. I saw the two
                                instances I have noticed in my poem: they were not allowed to go
                                into school, but Captain Woollcombe and the chaplain visited
                                them.</p>

                                Lord Chief Justice Hale, in a spirit of more decent gravity,
                                remarked, that âA sound, prudent method for an industrious education
                                of the poor, will give a better remedy against their corruptions
                                than all the gibbets and whipping-posts in the kingdom.â It was
                                Hale, also, who prophesied that the want of such an education, and
                                of âa due provision for relief in a way of industry,â would fill the
                                gaols with malefactors, and the kingdom with idle persons,
                                increasing, <emph>even to a desolation</emph>, in time!</p>

                            <p>See the glorious passage in a speech made by Mr. Canning, on being
                                presented with the freedom of the town of Plymouth:--</p>
                            <p>âOur present repose is no more a proof of inability to act, than the
                                state of<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7034-218"/> inertness and inactivity
                                in which I have seen those mighty masses that float in the waters
                                above your town, is a proof they are devoid of strength, and
                                incapable of being fitted out for action. You well know, gentlemen,
                                how soon one of those stupendous masses, now reposing on their
                                shadows in perfect stillness--how soon, upon any call of patriotism,
                                or of necessity, it would assume the likeness of an animated thing,
                                instinct with life and motion--how soon it would ruffle, as it were,
                                its swelling plumage--how quickly it would put forth all its beauty
                                and its bravery, collect its scattered elements of strength, and
                                awaken its dormant thunder. Such as is one of these magnificent
                                machines when springing from inaction into a display of its
                                might--such is England herself, while apparently passive and
                                motionless she silently concentrates the power to be put forth on an
                                adequate occasion. But God forbid that occasion should arise!â</p>

                            </q>
                            <p>The horrible fact here alluded to, is familiar to those who have read
                                many narratives of shipwrecks; one of the most fearful accounts is
                                that of the sufferings of the crew who escaped on a raft from the
                                wreck of the French frigate MÃ©duse, lost off the coast of Africa. I
                                have no opportunity of referring to that account, nor to the
                                statement of similar events in the American ship Peggy, where the
                                men drew lots which of them should perish, that his body might
                                become food for the survivors. The man who drew the lot calmly
                                requested the surgeon to bleed him to death, which was done; those
                                who fed on his flesh were taken ill; but it is doubtful (from a
                                comparison with other instances) whether the revolting meal was the
                                real cause of their illness. The following is abridged from Cyrus
                                Redding's âShipwrecks and Disasters at Sea,â and is part of the
                                narrative there given of the sufferings of six men who deserted from
                                the garrison at St. Helena in June 1799, with the intention of
                                joining an American brig, which they failed to reach:--</p>
                            <p>âProvisions running very short, they restrained themselves to an
                                ounce of bread in twenty-four hours, and two mouthfuls of water.</p>
                            <p>âThey continued on the same allowance until the 26th, when all their
                                provisions were consumed. On the 27th, M'Quin took a piece of bamboo
                                in his mouth to chew, and all the rest followed his example. It
                                being Brown's turn that night to steer the boat, he cut a piece from
                                one of his shoes, recollecting to have read of people in a similar
                                situation eating their shoes. But he was obliged to spit it out, as
                                it was soaked with salt water; therefore he took the inside sole,
                                part of which he ate, and distributed some to the others, but it
                                gave them no relief.</p>
                            <p>On the 1st of July, Parr caught a dolphin with a gaff, that had been
                                left in the boat, on which they all fell on their knees, and thanked
                                God for His goodness to them. They tore up the fish, and hung it out
                                to dry. On this they subsisted until the 4th, when, finding the
                                whole expended, bones and all,<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7034-219"/>
                                Parr, Brown, Brighouse, and Conway, proposed to scuttle the boat,
                                and let her go down, that they might be put out of their misery. The
                                other two objected, observing, that God, who had made man, always
                                found him something to eat.</p>
                            <p>âM'Kinnon, about eleven o'clock on the 5th, said, he thought it would
                                be better to cast lots for one of them to die, in order to save the
                                rest, to which they consented. The lots were made; but Parr having
                                been sick two days with the spotted fever, was excluded. It was his
                                province to write the numbers out, and put them into a hat, from
                                which the others, blindfolded, drew them, and put them in their
                                pockets.</p>
                            <p>âParr then asked whose lot it was to die: none knew what number was
                                in his pocket, but each prayed to God that it might fall on him. It
                                was agreed that he who had number five should die; and the lots
                                being unfolded, M'Kinnon's was number five.</p>
                            <p>âThey had previously agreed, that he on whom the lot fell should
                                bleed himself to death, for which purpose they had provided
                                themselves with nails from the boat, which they sharpened. M'Kinnon
                                with one of them cut himself in three places, in the foot, hand, and
                                wrist, and, praying God to forgive him, died in about a quarter of
                                an hour.</p>
                            <p>Before he was quite cold, Brighouse cut a piece of flesh off his
                                thigh with one of the same nails, and hung it up, leaving his body
                                in the boat. About three hours after they all ate of it, but only a
                                very small bit, and the piece lasted until the 7th of the month.
                                Every two hours they dipped the body in the sea in order to preserve
                                it.</p>
                            <p>âParr, having found a piece of slate in the bottom of the boat,
                                sharpened it on the mooring-stone, and cut out another piece of
                                M'Kinnon's thigh with it, which lasted them until the 8th. It was
                                then Brown's Watch, and he, observing the water change colour about
                                break of day, called the rest, thinking they were near the shore,
                                but, as it was not quite daylight, they saw no land. As soon as day
                                appeared, however, they discovered land right a-head, and steered
                                for it, and were close in with the shore about eight in the
                                morning.</p>
                            <p>âThere being a heavy surf they endeavoured to turn the boat's head to
                                it, which, from weakness, they were unable to accomplish, and soon
                                afterwards the boat upset. Brown, Parr, and Conway, got on shore,
                                but M'Quin and Brighouse were drowned.</p>
                            <p>âOn the prisoners informing the people that they were English, they
                                were immediately released, and three hammocks provided for them, in
                                which they were carried to the governor, who allowed them to lie in
                                his own bed, and gave them milk and rice to eat, but they were
                                seized with a locked-jaw, from not having ate any thing for a
                                considerable time, and continued ill until the 23d.â</p>

                            <p>The son of Admiral Sir R. Otway was lost in the sloop Victor, which
                                vessel he commanded. The Victor sailed from Vera Cruz (where the men
                                had been<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7034-220"/> suffering from fever) to
                                Halifax, on the 31st August, 1842, and was never heard of
                                afterwards. This afflicting bereavement was preceded by the sudden
                                death of another son, in the prime of youth, who was thrown while
                                riding in Hyde Park, and died of the injuries received in the
                                fall.</p>

                                                the Admiralty the death of Lieutenant James Lewis
                                                Fitzgerald and Lieutenant John Gore (flag
                                                lieutenant), together with eight seamen (as per
                                                margin), belonging to H.M.S. ship bearing my flag,
                                                the circumstances of which are as follows:--</p>
                                            <p>âOn the 30th of April, being about thirty-eight
                                                leagues to the eastward of Algoa Bay, the weather
                                                towards sunset confirmed the appearance during the
                                                day of approaching storm, and rendered it necessary
                                                to reef the courses, &amp;c. &amp;c., in doing which
                                                Henry Phillips fell from the fore-yard overboard.
                                                Lieutenant Gore saw he could not swim (and having
                                                had the happiness of saving a man's life, and
                                                confident of his powers, hoping to do so again), he
                                                leaped overboard while the boats were lowering. Two
                                                cutters were sent as expeditiously as possible,
                                                Lieutenant Fitzgerald in one, Lieutenant Hammond in
                                                the other; their search was decreed to be fruitless,
                                                though continued until dark. Lieutenant Hammond's
                                                boat returned safe, Lieutenant Fitzgerald's was
                                                within hail of the ship, when a heavy squall and one
                                                of those hollow destructive seas, so peculiar to
                                                this latitude, broke directly into her, and neither
                                                the boat nor any thing belonging to her was picked
                                                up. It was then impenetrably dark, and the gale
                                                continued until next day at noon.</p>

                                perished with her. Among the latter was lost a most promising youth,

                                written on the history and conquest of Mexico, as a most beautiful
                                and majestic race, slender and stately in appearance, or what is
                                sometimes termed âhigh-bredâ looking. They were active and manly,
                                but proved quite unequal to the tasks of drudgery in the mines,
                                imposed on them by the cruel and tyrannical Spaniards, and perished
                                in great numbers. Of their endurance and bravery of spirit many
                                interesting anecdotes are told, besides the story familiar to most
                                readers, of the Inca, who being, with his minister, Guatimozin,
                                bound on red-hot bars, and hearing the latter complain with groans
                                of the torture, said gently, âAm <emph>I</emph>, then, on a bed of

                            <p>Ben-Doran is one of the most beautiful of the mountains in
                                Perthshire. The glow and the fading of the sunset on the Highland
                                hills literally answers to the above simile. The most evanescent of
                                all things is a gleam of light; yet, I believe there are few persons
                                who do not retain vividly in their minds a fixed and lasting
                                impression of one or more of these â<emph>effects</emph>,â as they
                                are called. For my own part, I have a long imaginary gallery of
                                these âtransient pictures,â taken by land and sea, wherever I found
                                them, as faithfully, though not as visibly, as by the Daguerrotype
                                process. There, I and my good companion Memory, walk up and down on
                                dim grey winter days, and refresh ourselves with contemplation; and
                                there the ghost of youth is apt to join us, and induce us especially
                                to pause over âHighland Morningsâ (where the white soft clouds are
                                melting and lifting from the emerging hills) and âHighland Eveningsâ
                                (where the sunset light lies on the earth like the halo round a
                                saint's head.) Since the passage to which this note refers was
                                written, one other reality has become only a remembrance, in
                                consequence of the death of the kind-hearted companion and friend of
                                those Highland days, my brother-in-law, Sir Neil Menzies, whose

                            <p>The unfortunate disputes which have arisen during the last few years
                                in the Scotch church were, in 1843, productive of scenes of
                                violence, which all must have regretted, however strenuously and
                                conscientiously either party may have desired to uphold their
                                opinions. After the secession of the âFree Churchâ party, they
                                carried on, with much vigour and energy, the work which they had
                                commenced.â They sent their emissaries through the empire,
                                collecting subscriptions, extending their numbers and connexions,
                                and courting the sympathy and alliance of other ecclesiastical
                                communions with whom they were able to identify themselves by any
                                common bond. Their efforts in building churches, however, were
                                thwarted in several quarters by the refusal of the landholders to
                                allow them sites for the purpose. Several proprietors, among whom
                                were some noblemen of great influence, thought proper to decline
                                being parties to the propagation of what they probably deemed an
                                unjustifiable and dangerous schism by affording any facilities to
                                the Free Church. This opposition created much indignation and
                                bitterness among that party. In the course of the autumn of this
                                year, some serious disturbances took place in Ross-shire, and
                                elsewhere, in connexion with the Free Church movement. The people
                                alleging the refusal of the landowners to grant sites in
                                justification of their outbreak, took the law into their own hands,
                                and attempted forcibly to resist the induction of sonme of the new
                                ministers substituted for the seceders. Churches were barricaded,
                                and the obnoxious presentees driven away and assailed with stones
                                and other personal violence. At the settlement of a new minister at
                                the parish of Resolis, in Cromarty, so formidable a mob assembled,
                                taking possession of the church, and making demonstrations of
                                extreme violence, that a body of the coast-guard were sent for, the
                                Riot Act was read, and at last it became necessary to fire upon the
                                mob. Fortunately, no injury was done by the discharge, but to avoid
                                the necessity of endangering the lives of the people by a further
                                using of fire-arms, the civil authorities thought it prudent to
                                retire, and the new minister was inducted in the inn. The next day a
                                violent mob invaded the town of Cromarty, broke open the gaol, and
                                rescued one of the persons captured in the preceding affray. Some
                                serious hurts were received by those who resisted the
                                    rioters.â--<title>Annual Register</title>.</p>

                            <p>For this stanza I am indebted to the kindness of a friend (far better
                                able to treat such a subject), to whom I submitted the passage when
                                the proofs were in course of correction, and who modelled the
                                rough-cast of my thought into a different shape.</p>
                            <p>The following passage is to be found in Cave's âHistory of the
                                Apostles:â</p>
                            <p>âAnd here we may justly reflect upon the wise and admirable methods
                                of the Divine Providence, which in planting and propagating the
                                Christian religion in the world, made choice of such mean and
                                unlikely instruments, that he should hide these things from the wise
                                and prudent, and reveal them unto babes; men that had not been
                                educated in the Academy, and the schools of learning, but brought up
                                to a trade, to catch fish and mend nets; most of the Apostles being
                                taken from the meanest trades, and all of them (St. Paul excepted)
                                unfurnished of all arts of learning, and the advantages of liberal
                                and ingenuous education: and yet these were the men that were
                                designed to run down the world, and to overturn the learning of the
                                prudent. Certainly had human wisdom been to manage the business, it
                                would have taken quite other measures, and chosen out the
                                profoundest rabbins, the acutest philosophers, the smoothest
                                orators, such as would have been most likely by strength of reason
                                and arts of rhetoric to have triumphed over the minds of men, to
                                grapple with the stubbornness of the Jews, and baffle the finer
                                notions and speculations of the Greeks. We find that those sects of
                                philosophy that gained most credit in the heathen world did it this
                                way, by their eminency in some arts and sciences, whereby they
                                recommended themselves to the acceptance of the wiser and more
                                ingenious part of mankind. Julian the Apostate thinks it a
                                reasonable exception against the Jewish prophets, that they were
                                incompetent messengers and interpreters of the Divine will, because
                                they had not their minds cleared and purged, by passing through the
                                circle of polite arts and learning. Why, now this is the wonder of
                                it, that the first preachers of the gospel should be such rude,
                                unlearned men, and yet so suddenly, so powerfully prevail over the
                                learned world, and conquer so many, who had the greatest parts and
                                abilities, and the strongest prejudices against it, to the
                                simplicity of the gospel. When Celsus objected that the Apostles
                                were but a company of mean and illiterate persons, sorry mariners
                                and fishermen, Origen quickly returns upon him with this answer,
                                âThat hence 'twas plainly evident, that they taught Christianity by
                                a Divine power, when such persons were able with such an
                                uncontrolled success to subdue men to the obedience of his word; for
                                that they had no eloquent tongues, no subtile or discursive head,
                                none of the refined and rhetorical arts of Greece to conquer the
                                minds of men.â<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7034-224"/> âFor my part,â says
                                he, in another place, âI verily believe that the Holy Jesus
                                purposely made use of such preachers of his doctrine, that there
                                might be no suspicion that they came instructed with arts of
                                sophistry, but that it might be clearly manifest to all the world,
                                that there was no crafty design in it, and that they had a Divine
                                power going along with them, which was more efficacious than the
                                greatest volubility of expression, or ornaments of speech, or the
                                artifices which were used in the Grecian compositions.ââ</p>

                                unsettled by the late war. Many held very conscientious scruples
                                about renewing the public profession of Christianity and coming to
                                the Lord's Table, when they were liable at any moment to be called
                                out to war. They quoted the words of the 37th Article, as translated

                            <p>The immense distances which the poor have to go, before it can be
                                decided whether they are to be relieved or not, is one of those
                                flaws in the plan of the New Poor-law which so obviously require
                                re-consideration and reform. In an inquest lately held on the death
                                of a labouring man, named William Murrell, it was proved that his
                                wife journeyed twenty miles before she obtained an order for
                                grocery, &amp;c. in relief, worth three shillings! I have made an
                                extract from one of my brother's letters to shew what the law and
                                the practice is in the Dorchester Union; and it is the same in
                                others:--</p>
                            <p>âThe law and the practice is, that if a pauper residing in a Union
                                requires relief, he or she, be they able-bodied or otherwise, must
                                first make their application to the relieving officer: if their
                                distress be urgent, he is empowered to relieve them imemediately,
                                and report the circumstance to the Board of Guardians on the ensuing
                                board-day. If the relieving officer should be of opinion that the
                                    <pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7034-225"/> pauper is not actually
                                starving, he directs him to present himself at the Union House at
                                the next weekly meeting of the Board of Guardians. Now, observe the
                                excessive hardship of this. The relieving officer of the Dorchester
                                Union lives in my village. His district extends nearly in a circle
                                of seven miles. A pauper, therefore, living at this distance from
                                his house is compelled first to come to the relieving officer to
                                make known that he is out of work and requires relief for himself
                                and family. The relieving officer asks a few questions, does not
                                consider it an urgent case, solely because the man had probably been
                                employed until within a few days of his application, and tells him
                                to attend at the Union House the following Wednesday, when the Board
                                of Guardians will take the case into consideration. This probably
                                might take place on Friday when he has walked <emph>fourteen</emph>
                                miles there and back to see the relieving officer. He then has to
                                wait Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, without employment, and
                                probably without any other food but the potatoes from his garden. He
                                is afraid to run in debt at the baker's, perhaps they are
                                disinclined to give him credit. Wednesday comes, and he has to
                                travel <emph>twelve</emph> miles <emph>to</emph> the Union House. I
                                am not exaggerating the distance. When there, he is called before
                                the Board, composed generally of farmers; possibly the chairman may
                                be a man of property, and there may be a magistrate (who is an
                                    <foreign xml:lang="lat">ex-officio</foreign> guardian) present.
                                The pauper's case is then read from âthe Application and Report
                                Bookâ of the relieving officer.</p>

                                relief.â He is then asked various questions by different guardians,

                                direct the relieving officer to make out an order for the house;â
                                and thus it is entered in the book. The poor fellow then walks back
                                twelve miles (in Soper's case it was nine, which made
                                    <emph>eighteen</emph> in the course of the day), to tell his
                                family that he can have no relief except <emph>in</emph> the house.
                                They linger on for a few days longer in the hope of obtaining
                                employment, still feeding on potatoes for breakfast, dinner, and
                                supper; and, then a large rate-payer in the parish may probably
                                offer him a job, at 7<abbr>s.</abbr> per week, sooner than he shall
                                go into the house, which he knows will cost the parish
                                    2<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> per head, which would be
                                    17<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> per week. The
                                    <emph>job</emph> lasts ten days, perhaps a fortnight, and then a
                                fresh application to the relieving officer; the same long weary walk
                                to his house and back, with the same reply; the same long weary
                                walks to the Union House on the Wednesday following, and the same
                                heart-breaking result. This time he goes into the Union House, where
                                he is separated from his wife, and employed in cracking bones with a
                                long iron pestle (which blisters his hands) in a kind of wooden
                                mortar. This is out-door work. Last Wednesday, two lads were brought
                                before the Board for fighting in the Union House. They had
                                quarrelled because one had thrown into the other's mortar portions
                                of bone which were difficult to crush.â</p>

                            <p>In the case of W. Murrell there was an inquest, from the newspaper
                                report of which the following passage is given. The wife herself had
                                been ill, and they had struggled on, half-starved, endeavouring to
                                avoid the necessity of going into the workhouse:--</p>
                            <p>âLast Tuesday week deceased became very poorly, and, at the
                                persuasion of the wife, consented that she should apply for medical
                                relief. She accordingly on that morning left Ruislip Common, between
                                seven and eight o'clock, and walked to Hillingdon, to the residence
                                of Mr. Stockwell, the relieving officer for the Uxbridge Union,
                                where she arrived about nine o'clock. He gave her an order on Mr.
                                Rayner, surgeon, at Uxbridge, to whose house she proceeded with it,
                                and then returned home to Ruislip Common, which she reached about
                                twelve o'clock, having in the interim walked ten miles in a very
                                weak state, and without (having no money) bringing any food or
                                sustenance for her sick husband. Soon after her return home, Mr.
                                Rayner visited them, and, immediately on ascertaining their
                                destitute condition, he gave them an order for necessaries, which he
                                desired the wife to take to Mr. Stockwell. The poor jaded wife then
                                retraced her steps to Hillingdon, where the order of Mr. Rayner was
                                exchanged by Mr. Stockwell for an order on Mr. Collins, a tradesman
                                in Rnislip village, for grocery, &amp;c., to the value of
                                    3<abbr>s.</abbr>, with which supply she reached her home in the
                                evening, having in obtaining it had <emph>to traverse no less than
                                    twenty miles of ground</emph>. On the following Friday, she went
                                to the Board of Guardians at the Uxbridge Union Workhouse, at
                                Hilingdon, to ask for more relief, and told them that her husband
                                had got a promise of work on the following Monday, and Mr. Peirce,
                                one of the guardians, having stated that he had directed his bailiff
                                to set the deceased at work in grubbing, the board ordered her to
                                have her dinner, and Mr. Stockwell came out and told her to meet him
                                at Ruislip Church on the next day (Saturday). On her doing so, he
                                gave her three loaves and 1<abbr>s.</abbr> 8<abbr>d</abbr>Â½. in
                                money, being equivalent to another 3<abbr>s.</abbr> On that day
                                (Saturday) the deceased was very poorly, and on the Sunday he
                                complained that he had knocked his foot against a stump, and, as the
                                night advanced, getting worse, the wife called in the witness Hill,
                                who found the deceased lying on the bed, a chaff one, on his face,
                                when he complained of pain in his neck, and his jaw being locked. He
                                was, however, quite sensible, and could speak to the last of his
                                life. Mrs. Allday, the third witness, on the Tuesday morning went to
                                Uxbridge to fetch Mr. Rayner, but the deceased died before he could
                                arrive. Mrs. Allday stated that her husband had no employment but
                                breaking stones at the Uxbridge Union Workhouse, at which he could
                                never earn more than 1<abbr>s.</abbr> 4<abbr>d.</abbr> or
                                    1<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> a-day, and to perform that
                                work he had to walk ten miles a-day.</p>
                            <p>âMr. William Rayner, surgeon, of Uxbridge.--The immediate cause of
                                death was pressure on the brain and spinal marrow. Both the vessels
                                of the brain and the spinal marrow were turgid to a degree. Witness
                                had never before seen such a case in his life. Could not state that
                                want of food would produce lock-jaw. Considered that the state of
                                the toe was more likely to produce lock-jaw.</p>
                            <p>âThe coroner then said he trusted that the inquiry would produce
                                    good<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7034-227"/> results. <emph>It was a
                                    melancholy and deplorable thing for the poor to have to travel
                                    twenty miles before they could obtain 3<abbr>s.</abbr> worth of
                                    relief.</emph> It was making their lives a life of toil and
                                trouble, instead of affording them relief.</p>
                            <p>âThe room was then cleared of strangers, and, on the public being
                                again admitted, the jury returned a verdict of âDied from lock-jaw;â
                                and</p>
                            <p>âThe foreman said, that the jury could not separate without
                                expressing their great dissatisfaction and disgust at the
                                continuance of a system which compelled the poor, in the hour of
                                sickness and destitution, to travel so many miles as it was proved
                                that the wife of the deceased man was compelled to walk, before she
                                could obtain the relief that was necessary for their wants.â</p>

                            <p>The generosity of the poor to each other fairly puts the rich to
                                blush. There is scarcely an inquest held, in which it does not
                                appear that the lingering starvation endured was relieved and
                                delayed by the alms bestowed by those who could least afford to
                                spare it. And the same generosity holds good in the bestowal of what
                                to them is âincome,â namely, their time. In cases of sickness, or
                                helpless and bedridden confinement, it is astonishing how much time
                                is bestowed as charity,--the truest and best charity. In cases even
                                of removal from one poor cottage to another, I have heard the
                                labouring class offer âa dayâ and âhalf a dayâ of the time on which
                                their earnings depended, to assist in transporting the furniture and
                                effects of a neighbour, suffering and helpless.</p>

                                allowing his children to become street mendicants: âI was hurt,â he

                                become of us? If I'd been helped at the right time, I don't think it

                                                  have to put me in the ground. I have had it valued
                                                  10<abbr>l.</abbr> I judge that it will not cost
                                                  more than 5<abbr>l.</abbr> to lay me in the grave
                                                  in a humble way. The life I now live is a
                                                  miserable one, and has been for several years. I
                                                  have no one to care for me. Heaven is merciful!
                                                  Yet a little while, and this feverish and unquiet
                                                  spirit, I most sincerely hope, will be at rest
                                                  with the hope that the Almighty will pardon me.
                                                  Was I sure of that, I should leave the world
                                                  without the least regret. I must chance what many
                                                  great people have done before me. I am obliged to
                                                  all friends that have been kind to me. My dear
                                                  friend, I hope you will let some one follow me to
                                                  the grave, but that I leave to you. I do not wish
                                                  any one here to know my affairs. You will do as
                                                  you please with my clothes. I am sorry to say that
                                                  I owe Mrs. White this day seven weeks' rent (Nov.
                                                  5). I am very sorry to leave the world in debt. If
                                                  my clothes and watch will not pay the expenses of
                                                  my funeral and rent, it is my wish to be sent to
                                                  the workhouse. My watch you will find in the large

                            <p>âThe poor creature lodged in the back attic of the house. She had
                                made no complaint of illness on the day that she was last seen
                                alive, and the extent of her distress was not known in the house.
                                Mrs. Jones, the witness, said deceased was an extremely well-behaved
                                woman, and had been highly educated. They always imagined she had
                                some trifling income that helped to support her, but since her death
                                they had found such was not the case, but that she supported herself
                                by the needle. She had lately appeared very desponding, which she
                                stated arose from inability to procure work, and the poor wages she
                                received. She had once or twice adverted lately to the double
                                suicide at Kilmarnock, and said she would rather follow that example
                                than apply for relief. She had some friends who occasionally gave
                                her food; but she seldom had any other meals but breakfast and tea.
                                Mr. Foxstaff, on examining the stomach, and the dregs of the cup
                                alluded to, found that both contained oxalic acid, of which poison
                                    she<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7034-229"/> had died. The deceased had
                                all the appearance of having been completely starved. The jury
                                returned a verdict, âThat the deceased destroyed herself by taking
                                oxalic acid; but that there was no evidence of the state of her
                                mind.ââ</p>
                            <p>The first case that made the public aware of the extraordinarily
                                small sums paid to poor needle-women, was that of the Miss Reynolds,
                                daughters of Major Reynolds, who were making shirts at three
                                half-pence a-piece. This case, which occurred at the Whitechapel
                                office (Hon. G.C. Norton), was largely subscribed to. A Society for
                                the relief of distressed Needlewomen now exists; and a long list of
                                fashionable names follows that of Lord Ashley, as head of the
                                association. The fact of the excessive hours of over-work, and the
                                small remuneration accorded, is no novelty; but the combination of a
                                section of the rich to prevent this one cause of misery,
                                    <emph>is</emph> a novelty, and one worthy of notice.</p>
                            <p>What may be done to save and rescue, in hours of terrible temptation
                                and despair, was illustrated by another case at the Whitechapel
                                office. The captain of a merchant-ship, who was brought before Mr.
                                Norton for attempting to commit suicide, after a long struggle with
                                adverse fortune, was relieved from the poor's box; and some
                                encouraging advice was given him by the magistrate. Three or four
                                years afterwards he returned with the amount, and stated, that he
                                had begun again as a sailor before the mast, and had again become
                                master. He said the magistrate had â<emph>put a new heart in
                                    him</emph>.â</p>

                            <p>The wells in Arabia and Syria are often covered up with a flat stone,
                                for the purpose of keeping out the sand, or to prevent cattle from
                                doing them any harm. Jacob's well was so covered when Rachel
                                approached.</p>
                            <p>âThen Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people
                                of the east. And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo,
                                there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well
                                they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's
                                mouth. And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
                                stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the
                                stone again upon the well's mouth in his place. And he said, Lo, it
                                is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be
                                gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them. And
                                they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and
                                till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the
                                sheep. And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her
                                father's sheep: for she kept them. And it came to pass, when Jacob
                                saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep
                                of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the
                                stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his
                                mother's brother.â--<title>Genesis</title>, chap. xxix. ver. 1, 2,

                                state of mind which, in his own person, destitution and the sight of

                            <p>âI felt myself, as it were, shut out from mankind--enclosed--prisoned
                                in misery--no outlook--none! My miserable wife and little ones, who
                                alone cared for me--what would I not have done for their sakes at
                                that hour! Here let me speak out--and be heard too, while I tell
                                it--that the world does not at all times know how unsafely it

                                For my own part, I confess that, ever since that dreadful night, I
                                can never hear of an extraordinary criminal, without the wish to
                                pierce through the mere judicial view of his career, under which, I
                                am persuaded, there would often be found to exist an unseen
                                impulse--a chain, with one end fixed in Nature's holiest ground,
                                that drew him on to his destiny.â</p>

                                except a few handfuls of bhoosa, for which we paid from five to ten

                                city. Whilst he selected these, I found, amongst the ones thrown
                                aside, Campbell's Poems, which opened at Hohenlinden; and, strange

                                the confusion was fearful. The force was perfectly disorganised,
                                nearly every man paralysed with cold, so as to be scarcely able to
                                hold his musket, or move. Many frozen corpses lay on the ground. The
                                Sipahees burnt their caps, accoutrements, and clothes, to keep

                                the baggage and column in the pass: here they were heavily fired on;
                                many camels were killed. On one camel were, in one kajava, Mrs.
                                Boyd, and her youngest boy Hugh; and in the other Mrs. Mainwaring,
                                and her infant, scarcely three months old; and Mrs. Anderson's
                                eldest child. This camel was shot. Mrs. Boyd got a horse to ride;
                                and her child was put on another behind a man, who being shortly
                                after unfortunately killed, the child was carried off by the
                                Affghans. Mrs. Mainwaring, less fortunate, took her own baby in her
                                arms. Mary Anderson was carried off in the confusion. Meeting with a
                                pony laden with treasure, Mrs. M. endeavoured to mount, and sit on

                                her if she was wounded, and told her to mount behind him. This
                                apparently kind offer she declined, being fearful of treachery;
                                alleging as an excuse that she could not sit behind him on account
                                of the difficulty of holding her child when so mounted. This man
                                shortly after snatched her shawl off her shoulders, and left her to
                                her fate. Mrs. M.'s sufferings were very great; and she deserves
                                much credit for having preserved her child through these dreadful
                                scenes. She not only had to walk a considerable distance with her
                                child in her arms through the deep snow, but had also to pick her
                                way over the bodies of the dead, dying, and wounded, both men and
                                cattle, and constantly to cross the streams of water, wet up to the

                                up a sharp fire, and several persons being killed close to her. She,
                                however, got safe to camp with her child.</p>

                                frost-bitten and starving; some perfectly out of their senses, and
                                idiotic. Major Ewart, 54th, and Major Scott, 44th, were recognised
                                as we passed them, with some others. The sight was dreadful; the

                                by the frost. The limbs of many of these poor wretches had

                                excruciating torture as it is seldom the lot of man to witness. Yet
                                the unmerciful Giljyes, regardless of their sufferings, dragged them
                                forth along the rough ground, to perish miserably in the fields,
                                without food or shelter, or the consolations of human sympathy.</p>

                                descent made a great difference in the climate and the progress of
                                vegetation; the wild roses were every where in full bloom, and, with
                                other gay flowers, scented the air and enlivened the scene. We

                                led us to the foot of the Huft Kotul, or hill of seven ascents. Here

                            <p>It is a curious fact that a letter is said to be extant, containing

                                fortunately unsuccessful on that one occasion, and lived to be âDuke

                            <p>The âShrine of Bethlehemâ was one of the subjects at the Diorama some
                                time ago, and was given with a wonderful effect of reality. A
                                description of it may be found in âEÃ¶then:â--</p>
                            <p>âThe village of Bethlehem lies prettily couched on the slope of a
                                hill. The sanctuary is a subterranean grotto, and is committed to
                                the joint guardianship of the Romans, Greeks, and Armenians, who vie
                                with each other in adorning it. Beneath an altar gorgeously
                                decorated, and lit with everlasting fires, there stands the low slab
                                of stone which marks the holy site of the Nativity; and near to this
                                is a hollow scooped out of the living rock. Here the infant Jesus
                                was laid. Near the spot of the Nativity is the rock against which
                                the Blessed Virgin was leaning, when she presented her babe to the
                                adoring shepherds.</p>
                            <p>âMany of those Protestants who are accustomed to despise tradition
                                consider that this sanctuary is altogether unscriptural--that a
                                grotto is not a stable, and that mangers are made of wood. It is
                                perfectly true, however, that the many grottoes, and caves which are
                                found among the rocks of Judea, were formerly used for the reception
                                of cattle; they are so used at this day; I have myself seen grottoes
                                appropriated to this purpose.â</p>
                            <p>An account is also given in Mr. Warburton's interesting volumes, âThe
                                Crescent and the Cross:â--</p>
                            <p>âEntering by a very low door and long passage, almost upon hands and
                                knees, I stood up under the noble dome of the Church of St. Helena.
                                The roof, constructed of cedar-wood from Lebanon, is supported by
                                forty huge marble pillars, shewing dimly the faded images of painted
                                saints. The whole building is silent, dirty, and neglected-looking,
                                but of noble proportions.</p>
                            <p>âThe chapel of the Nativity is a subterranean grotto, into which you
                                descend in darkness, that gives way to the softened light of many
                                silver lamps suspended from the roof. Notwithstanding, the
                                improbability of this being the actual place of the Nativity, one
                                cannot descend with indifference into the enclosure, which has led
                                so many millions of pilgrims in rags or armour during 1800 years
                                from their distant homes: It is, however, impossible to recognise
                                any thing like a reality in the mass of marble, brass, and silken
                                tawdry ornaments; and one leaves this most celebrated spot in the
                                world with feelings of disappointment.â</p>

                                            <p><hi>SIR</hi>,--The many columns devoted to the cause
                                                of the poor in your admirable paper embolden me to
                                                hope that space will be afforded to some
                                                observations on the abuse of private charity
                                                recently alluded to in the case of Margaret Walsh,
                                                namely, aims-giving in the metropolis, or, as your
                                                writer terms it, â<emph>thoughtless
                                                  alms-giving</emph>.â</p>
                                            <p>âThe late Mr. Walker (author of the
                                                  <title>Original</title>, and for many years
                                                magistrate for the district of Whitechapel) held an
                                                opinion, founded on his own personal observation and
                                                experience among the poor, that no man, however
                                                humble his trade or occupation, ever came to such
                                                distress as to be reduced to solicit alms, unless
                                                through drunkenness, improvidence, rash and
                                                dishonest speculation, or want of common
                                                industry--in short, that excess of poverty was
                                                invariably a man's own fault. Following out this
                                                principle, Mr. Walker disapproved of all
                                                alms-giving, as tending to weaken the
                                                self-dependence of the labouring classes, by the
                                                dangerous example of the relief so afforded. He had
                                                written a pamphlet, embodying most of the severe
                                                provisions of the present New Poor Law, <emph>nearly
                                                  twenty years before that measure came into
                                                  operation</emph>; and, though a kind-hearted and
                                                generous man, I cannot recollect a single case of
                                                the many we discussed together, in which he thought
                                                it just or fit that âcharityâ should be given.
                                                Relief by alms was in his eyes a premium on
                                                improvidence, a reward for sin and folly.</p>
                                            <p>âThe opinions of Mr. Walker are those of a large and
                                                daily increasing class. I think the fault of those
                                                opinions, the fault of the New Poor Law, and the
                                                fault of the reasoning which is becoming the
                                                fashion--for there is a fashion even in
                                                this--consists in the painful fact, that whereas we
                                                used to hold ourselves bound to relieve our starving
                                                fellow-creatures, we now hold ourselves bound to sit
                                                in judgment on them. We are grown such theorists as
                                                to the causes of their distress, that the distress
                                                itself is scarcely heeded; and the varieties of
                                                disease, privation, and suffering, which come under
                                                our notice, are no longer treated as if they
                                                involved life and death, flesh and blood, but as
                                                mere available examples of<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7034-240"/>
                                                <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> arguments. We are
                                                accused of having formerly encouraged the vices of
                                                the poor by too indulgent a consideration of their
                                                necessities. God knows, we have now well-nigh
                                                forgotten their necessities in too stern a
                                                consideration of their vices.</p>
                                            <p>âThe present result of these new rules and axioms is,
                                                (I am informed by clergymen and others well
                                                calculated to give an opinion,) a great addition to
                                                the sums distributed in private charity, and an
                                                increased disposition to âthoughtless alms-giving.â
                                                The thinkers of the day having decided that relief
                                                ought not to be afforded, it is on the âthoughtless
                                                aims-giversâ that the poor chiefly rely. But the
                                                poor know, as well as we do, how little real charity
                                                or principle there is in these alms; they know, that
                                                whereas the thinkers deny their claim, the
                                                thoughtless forget it, and it is melancholy to
                                                observe how sharp-witted misery will make them; how
                                                the âsimple cunningâ peculiar to the childish, the
                                                helpless, and the uneducated, enables them to make
                                                an intuitive calculation of the quickest methods to
                                                rouse compassion; and how the latent consciousness
                                                that it has been an effort of their own skill,
                                                rather than a spontaneous movement of heart-pity,
                                                destroys all gratitude when they have succeeded.</p>
                                            <p>âThe poor feel they are not thought of; and there is
                                                no trick of cunning they will not adopt to force
                                                attention. They will borrow on loan each other's
                                                pawn-tickets, hospital-admissions, and certificates
                                                of distress, and pay a consideration out of what is
                                                thus obtained. They will hire each other's children
                                                at so much per day; they will affect lameness,
                                                blindness, fits, &amp;c. We are content with blaming
                                                the imposture without seeking into its cause. The
                                                neglect of the rich is the bad rank soil, from which
                                                springs the hypocrisy of the poor!</p>
                                            <p>âThe thinker reproves the thoughtless alms-giver for
                                                giving to common street-beggars. He saw with his own
                                                eyes the woman he relieved go into the next
                                                public-house. She bought gin, instead of a loaf for
                                                her young family, horrid drunken creature! And the
                                                old couple, whose blankets were taken out of pawn,
                                                have pawned them again, and sold the counterpane
                                                provided; and the man who pretended to have seven
                                                children has only four--three have been dead these
                                                six years; and the consumptive woman who could not
                                                nurse her baby turns out not to be its mother at
                                                all, but to have had it left with her, being
                                                deserted by its own âunnaturalâ parent, and now she
                                                makes her market of the infant by this cunning
                                                device. All, in short, is perfidy, imposition, and
                                                ingratitude; and the thoughtless alms-giver
                                                acknowledges her folly, and remarks in self-excuse,
                                                that it was so painful to see them stand shivering
                                                at the carriage window, but that she âreally will

                                            <p>âThat evening, perhaps, the thinker and the
                                                thoughtless alms-giver are at a fashionable party.
                                                They hear the news of the day discussed. An
                                                improvident love-match has been made against
                                                parental consent; an accomplished man of fashion has
                                                destroyed himself; General So-and-so's nephew is
                                                dead at the age of twenty-eight, from hard drinking.
                                                Now, mark how they sympathise with that young
                                                couple; how they lament, without blaming, the rashly
                                                departed;--âPoor fellow! with all his expectations,

                                                times, to gamble away his last farthing, and shoot
                                                himself at last! It is very melancholy--very sad,

                                                something sadder yet to think upon, and that is, the
                                                different measure with which we have meted out, and
                                                continue to mete out, our sympathy to the rich and
                                                to the poor. The rich man's nephew has perished
                                                young, because he could not resist the vice of
                                                drinking. The rich man's son has shot himself,
                                                because he could not forbear the sin of gambling. We
                                                think upon them as we knew them--smiling, social,

                                                There is no greater evidence of the combined
                                                ignorance and improvidence of the lower classes,
                                                than the management of their diet. In the country,
                                                that ignorance and that improvidence are rendered
                                                less mischievous in their effects by a perpetual
                                                dependence in hours of sickness or distress, on âthe
                                                great house,â âthe parsonage,â &amp;c., for
                                                assistance and advice; and, above all, for
                                                contributions from the âstore-room.â In London,
                                                giving in kind, as it is called--giving coals,
                                                potatoes, meat, or orders for these things on one's
                                                own trades-<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7034-245"/>
                                                people, is an incalculable benefit to the poor, who,
                                                from their retail method of purchasing, often pay
                                                  <emph>three times as much as the rich do</emph>
                                                for the necessaries of life. The shilling given in
                                                the street, probably ill laid out, and at all events
                                                laid out under the disadvantages I have explained,
                                                is a poor substitute for the âshilling's worthâ of
                                                stores we might have given, had we âtaken thought
                                                for the poor.â They take little thought for
                                                themselves, it is true; but before we indulge the
                                                feeling of irritation at their improvidence, let us
                                                strive to correct it: not always by reproof, for an
                                                empty stomach is an ill digester of rebukes; but by
                                                such practice as that I have referred to: and I will
                                                venture to state, that the amount of real relief
                                                will be quadrupled to the recipient at half the cost
                                                of casual alms to the donor.</p>
                                            <p>âTo affirm that it <emph>must be</emph> injurious to
                                                the poor to bestow on them what they have not
                                                earned, is to assert a paradox we should be loth to
                                                admit if applied to ourselves. How many of the
                                                comparatively rich have anxiously depended, in some
                                                hard hour of life, on a small loan; or craved a word
                                                of recommendation from a great man? Have they, at
                                                such times, invariably scanned their own deserts
                                                with a critical eye? Have they always balanced
                                                defect of prudence against necessity for aid? Would
                                                it not not seem strange to us, in moments like
                                                these, to be answered as we answer the poor? to be
                                                judged as we judge the poor? The self-dependence of
                                                the lower classes is a very dazzling theory, but it
                                                would borrow weight if we could point to the
                                                self-dependence of the upper classes as a practical
                                                example for imitation; and not reserve even begging
                                                (on a large scale) as an indulgence sacred to the
                                                rich. We are all dependent creatures: few men could
                                                honestly assert, whatever their position in life,
                                                that they never required or accepted aid, in any
                                                shape, from any human being. Why are the most
                                                helpless to be the class unassisted? Why is
                                                alms-giving from our superfluity (we rarely overdraw
                                                that fund) to be forbid, as folly? Charity requires
                                                regulating like all other human motives of action;
                                                and the great rule for metropolitan alms-giving
                                                should be, <emph>never, if possible, to give
                                                  money</emph>, unless to redeem tools, defray a
                                                doctor's bill (that ruinous expense of the poor),
                                                make good an arrear of rent, or, in some
                                                discretionary cases, liquidate one of those small
                                                debts, the nonpayment of which frequently involve a
                                                whole family in irretrievable ruin. But these are
                                                matters in which the practical experience of every
                                                willing alms-giver may guide him; and to practical
                                                experience I leave it, anxious only to establish
                                                what appears to me the simplest and most obvious of
                                                all religious truths: namely, that we have <emph>no
                                                  right</emph> to âturn our face from any poor man;â
                                                we have <emph>no right</emph> to refuse the alms we
                                                are especially commanded to bestow; and, therefore,
                                                it behoves us merely to attend to the manner of
                                                bestowing them.â</p>
