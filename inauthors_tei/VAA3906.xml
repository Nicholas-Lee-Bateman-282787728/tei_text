                <p>AT a Continental hotel, upon a laundry list prepared specially for English and
                    American guests, there is found, after the usual catalogue of shirts, collars,
                    cuffs, handkerchiefs, etc., a peculiar generic name, &quot;
                    Variosshapes.&quot; Having made certain modest efforts in history,
                    biography, and fiction, I come now before the public with my &quot;
                    Variosshapes,&quot; which are as miscellaneous in outline and substance as
                    the forms of old Proteus himself.</p>

                    <head rend="center">ON SPELLBINDERS</head>
                    <p>A LOCAL authority on spellbinding once gave me the following prescription:
                        &quot;Fill yourself with your subject, knock out the bung, and let
                        nature caper.&quot; Even according to this recipe it is necessary to
                        fill yourself with your subject, and no man is of much use in a political
                        campaign who has not made a careful study of the issues.</p>
                    <p>But men do this in different ways. One will prepare a speech and commit it
                        verbatim. Another will read all he can lay his hands on, classify and
                        arrange his thoughts, and then trust to the occasion for his language.
                        Anotherwill prepare two or three addresses, or at least the materials for
                        them, <pb n="2" id="VAA3906-007"/> and then select, at the last moment, the
                        one which he thinks best adapted to the audience and the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The spellbinder, talking as he does day after day, is sure to find out by
                        experience the things that are most effective in what he says. He soon
                        leaves out the poorer parts of his speeches, adds something new to the rest,
                        and before the end of the campaign there is developed, by a natural and
                        experimental evolution, a far better argument than the one with which he
                        began it.</p>
                    <p>The man who goes out with a single address is sometimes caught in an awkward
                        predicament. It is depressing to find among your auditors a large delegation
                        from Smithville, where you delivered that magnificent peroration just two
                        nights before. Even the same line of argument is apt to weary those who have
                        once heard it. The &quot;Compleat Angler&quot; who expects to catch
                        many kinds of fish will not go out with a single kind of bait, and the
                        &quot;Compleat Spellbinder&quot; ought to have an assortment of
                        speeches. Sometimes the daily press will report what you say in full, and it
                        is embarrassing to come before your auditors prepared only to repeat what
                        they <pb n="3" id="VAA3906-008"/> have just read in the newspaper. I
                        remember once being nearly caught in that predicament in Chicago, through
                        the error of a reporter to whom a copy of my remarks had been given in
                        advance, for, as I came upon the stage of the Central Music Hall one
                        evening, I found myself congratulated upon an address which I was supposed
                        to have delivered that afternoon, and which filled some two or three columns
                        of the evening paper. Luckily I had other material on hand, and could
                        substitute.</p>
                    <p>The only safe plan for the spellbinder is to have speeches enough to
                        &quot;go round.&quot; But if the newspapers print all you say, you
                        are sometimes hard put to it to furnish new matter. Once when I was
                        campaigning in Massachusetts, one of the Boston papers asked me each day to
                        dictate &quot;copy to a reporter, which the editor afterwards
                        interspersed with presumptive &quot;applause,&quot;
                        &quot;laughter,&quot; &quot;great enthusiasm,&quot; etc., in
                        advance of delivery. This went on very well until Friday, when I found
                        myself pumped dry, and on Saturday I was compelled, for lack of new matter,
                        to condense the previous speeches of the week into one.</p>
                    <pb n="4" id="VAA3906-009"/>
                    <p>It seems to me marvellous how men like Mr. Bryan, whose speeches are reported
                        by the score and the hundred, can hold out as long as they do. But, in fact,
                        after the first week or two there is little change. They avail themselves of
                        new occurrences, local allusions, etc., but the substance of their addresses
                        is much the same.</p>
                    <p>For the purpose of furnishing materials for spellbinders, each of the parties
                        prepares a &quot;Campaign Text-Book.&quot; This work is generally
                        done by specialists, a particular subject being given to the man who is
                        supposed to know the most about it. These books are hastily compiled,
                        however, and are not by any means the best sources from which the
                        spellbinder may collect his materials. They are often inaccurate and always
                        violently partisan, generally concealing the opposing facts and arguments,
                        so that the man who relies upon them may easily be caught napping by an
                        antagonist who understands the other side of the question, which these
                        &quot;textbooks &quot; fail to disclose.</p>
                    <p>The joint debate is perhaps the best method of political discussion. In this
                        the &quot;campaign lie&quot; has to be eliminated. <pb n="5"
                            id="VAA3906-010"/> Such a debate requires more careful preparation than
                        a regular speech, yet even here there is a great deal that depends upon
                        accident and the humor of the audience. I remember once debating with a
                        Greenbacker in a little country town. He had sent me a challenge, and when
                        it came to dividing the time, I told him would make the division and he
                        might say which of the two sections he would prefer. One of us was to speak
                        half an hour, the other was to have an hour to reply, and the man who spoke
                        first was to close in fifteen minutes. My opponent preferred to take the
                        hour. The speeches were made from the porch of a country store. There was a
                        large number of improvised benches, where the people sat, and behind these
                        was a circle of carriages. It was quite dark, there being no light except
                        immediately around the speakers, so that the carriages in the rear were
                        scarcely visible. I spoke for my half hour, and then my adversary, an
                        intelligent farmer, made a very good argument, carefully prepared, which
                        needed an answer. I had only fifteen minutes in which to reply. I talked as
                        rapidly as possible, answering his propositions one after another <pb n="6"
                            id="VAA3906-011"/> in quick succession. Suddenly a voice came from one
                        of the carriages in the rear of the crowd asking a question. I replied
                        quickly, and went on. Then followed another question and another, until the
                        object seemed to be to cut short my time. Fortunately there came to my
                        rescue a farmer boy, who rose in the midst of the audience. He was a
                        freckled, redheaded lad, in shirt sleeves, with one suspender holding up his
                        trousers. He pointed back into the darkness whence the voice proceeded, and
                        solemnly asked, &quot;Who the devil are you, anyway?&quot; and a
                        voice replied, &quot;I am the Hon. Charles Jenkins of Ohio.&quot;
                        &quot;Well, why the devil don&apos;t you go back to Ohio?&quot;
                        A shout went up from the throng and all further interruption ceased.</p>
                    <p>Men who interrupt the speaker are not often wise. The man on the platform has
                        a great advantage, for he has the last word and a sympathetic audience, so
                        that even a poor retort uttered with a triumphant air is sure to carry the
                        day.</p>
                    <p>Not long ago when I happened to mention the name of Mr. Bryan, a big fellow
                        rose in the midst of the audience, flung his <pb n="7" id="VAA3906-012"/>
                        arms aloft, and shouted, &quot;He&apos;s a good man,&quot; and
                        there was applause from some Democratic benches. I said to him, &quot;
                        Suppose you tell me, my friend, one good thing he ever did in public
                        life,&quot; and I paused for a reply. Now I was taking some chances in
                        this challenge. Perhaps the man really knew of something valuable in Mr.
                        Bryan&apos;s career, something I had not heard of In that case he could
                        have turned the tables on me. But he could not think of anything, so, after
                        a dead silence, there came another burst of applause, and this time it was
                        for me, as my interlocutor slipped to the door amid the jeers of the
                        bystanders.</p>
                    <p>Encouraged by this success, at my next meeting I asked the entire audience
                        the same question, and the answer came, &quot;He prophesied,&quot;
                        which gave an opportunity for salutary elaboration.</p>
                    <p>On another occasion the answer was, &quot;He broke up the Democratic
                        party,&quot; which gave room for a profitable distinction between
                        voluntary and involuntary beneficence.</p>
                    <p>Thus it is that the spellbinder can often score a point if he encourages
                        interruptions, <pb n="8" id="VAA3906-013"/> for a running debate is far more
                        effective than a continuous speech. Sometimes, however, the interruptions
                        are so incoherent as to be disastrous. Once while addressing an out-of-door
                        meeting, after obtaining some trifing advantage over an interlocutor, I
                        called for further criticism, when a little old man, with a long chin beard,
                        emitted from the outskirts of the crowd some inarticulate noises which
                        sounded to me like &quot;Wah-hoo-wah-hee- bah!&quot; I put my hand
                        to my ear, assumed &quot;a pleasant expression,&quot; and said,
                        &quot;I did not quite understand my friend.&quot; Again the noises
                        were repeated, only a little louder. The man had evidently some impediment
                        in his speech. I believe it is a well understood principle that, where one
                        is speaking in an unknown tongue, the way to become perfectly clear is to
                        utter exactly the same sounds with greater vociferation and redoubled
                        energy. Again I repeated my inquiry, and this time he screamed at the top of
                        his voice, &quot;Wah-hoo-wah-hee-bah!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Generally the wrath of the audience pursues the man guilty of the
                        interruption, but this time it was very justly directed against <pb n="9"
                            id="VAA3906-014"/> myself, for a big fellow in front, who had heard
                        enough of this sort of joint discussion, cried out in disgust, &quot;Oh,
                        go on, we &apos;ve got to go to bed some time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Once, while political feeling was very bitter, I was speaking in the opera
                        house of one of the cities of the Northwest, when a man in one of the front
                        seats arose and commenced asking questions. I answered them apparently to
                        the satisfaction of the audience, who cheered lustily at every retort. But
                        this only spurred him on to renewed efforts, until finally a cry,
                        &quot;Put him out!&quot; arose from many parts of the house. It
                        seemed to me that the colloquy was profitable, and I asked the audience to
                        let him alone. But the chairman of the meeting was seized with great
                        indignation, and, rushing to the footlights, shook his fist at the
                        interlocutor, swore at him, and ordered him to get out. The man at last said
                        he was going, but asked first to shake hands with the speaker. I invited him
                        to come forward and do so, not without apprehensions that he would
                        &quot;yank&quot; me over the footlights, and the handshaking on my
                        part was very brief. While it was going on a policeman stole up behind him,
                            <pb n="10" id="VAA3906-015"/> seized him by the collar, and his
                        departure was more sudden than he intended.</p>
                    <p>Campaign oratory, being largely extemporaneous, varies greatly in excellence,
                        according to the mood of the speaker and the temper of the audience. In one
                        place there will be an enthusiastic multitude to greet every effective point
                        with ringing salvos of applause; at the next place there will be silence; in
                        a third there will be general inattention and disorder, and perhaps the
                        spellbinder will find his audience beginning to disperse within a few
                        minutes after he commences his speech. A political audience is not to be
                        held together like the congregation of a church or an assemblage that has
                        paid its money for a lecture. A man who attends a campaign meeting will not
                        hesitate to leave when he has heard enough. I think we campaigners generally
                        attribute an exodus from the hall while we are talking either to the hot
                        night or to the trains which are just about to depart, or else to a
                        conspiracy set on foot by the opposite party. But there are times when we
                        cannot flatter ourselves with these illusions.</p>
                    <p>I remember making an address in my <pb n="11" id="VAA3906-016"/> own State,
                        illustrated (as I thought) by a few apposite quotations. The audience
                        listened attentively and appreciatively for more than two hours. I made
                        substantially the same speech a few days later in a little country town in
                        Maine, but I noticed that my hearers were restless and a number left the
                        hall. Next morning, while sitting on the porch of the village inn, I
                        overheard two countrymen who met in the dusty square in front.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was you to the meetin&apos; last night, neighbor
                        Jenkins?&quot; asked one of the other.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yaas,&quot; was the answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did ye hear the speakin&apos;? &quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yaas.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How was it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, &apos;t wa&apos; n&apos;t no account. &quot;T
                        was mostly quotashunns.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do tell!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Evidently the demand in that place was for original thought.</p>
                    <p>Opinions of a speech will differ widely among those who hear it. After a
                        rather earnest argument at a meeting in a country town one of my auditors
                        came up and clasped me by both my hands, crying enthusiastically,
                        &quot;That was a slick one!&quot; <pb n="12" id="VAA3906-017"/>Just
                        outside the door two others were talking together as I passed. &quot;
                        What did you think of it?&quot; said one. &quot;I call it a bum
                        speech,&quot; said the other. Now, whatever be the precise meaning of
                        &quot;slick&quot; and &quot;bum,&quot; no latitude of
                        definition will ever make them synonymous. So I passed on, consoling myself
                        that the last man must have been a wicked Democrat.</p>
                    <p>There is a great difference in audiences as to applause. Generally they are
                        more demonstrative in the cities than in the country districts, and I think
                        perhaps a Chicago audience is more responsive than that of any other city in
                        the North. In some of the rural neighborhoods of New England they call a
                        political speech a &quot;lecture,&quot; and seem to think they ought
                        to treat it with the same solemnity as a sermon.</p>
                    <p>At a meeting in the pretty opera house of a quiet Maine town the hall was
                        filled with a gathering of grave and substantial citizens. The committeemen
                        and local party leaders arranged themselves in a semi-circle across the
                        stage, much like the performers in a minstrel show, and every hit made by
                        the speaker was greeted with a methodical clapping of hands from the
                        &quot;thin <pb n="13" id="VAA3906-018"/> black line&quot; behind
                        him, but with absolute silence in front; yet the gravity of no one, either
                        on the stage or on the floor, was disturbed in the least by the unilateral
                        character of the applause thus solemnly administered.</p>
                    <p>Some audiences are much slower in &quot; seeing the point &quot;than
                        others, and again, there is a great difference between different groups even
                        in the same audience. I have often seen a ripple of applause or laughter
                        break out repeatedly in one particular spot, and then it would seem to
                        diffuse itself in circling waves until it reached the extreme verge of the
                        crowd.</p>
                    <p>There are two kinds of applause which appear to me very different in
                        character. One is that which gives an appropriate greeting to some apt
                        sentiment, or to the conclusion of an argument, and the other is that which
                        follows the mere utterance of a popular name, generally the name of some
                        candidate. The latter kind is not specially complimentary to the
                        speaker.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, noisy demonstration is very rarely a proof of the excellence of a
                        speech. I remember once hearing a fine argument by Senator Sherman, which
                        was <pb n="14" id="VAA3906-019"/> received in silence, and was followed by a
                        speech by &quot;Jim&quot; Sullivan, the Irish orator, who rehearsed
                        his story of the Republican pup that had its eyes open and the Democratic
                        pup that had its eyes closed, with other narratives of like character, which
                        were greeted with rapturous applause; and I then and there resolved to
                        eschew all efforts to awaken that sort of enthusiasm. The close attention of
                        an audience ought to be as gratifying as the clapping of hands, the stamping
                        of feet, and shouts from &quot;the boys&quot; interjected at
                        inopportune places.</p>
                    <p>The point of a story is often the signal for an outburst, and no one can deny
                        the power of apposite illustration. The parables of the Bible and the
                        stories of Lincoln had in them a pith and a point which could not be as well
                        made in any other way. But many speakers are tempted, not to make the story
                        the illustration of the speech, but to make the speech a mere <hi rend="i"
                            >pot-pourri</hi> of stories. The man who does this may be amusing, but
                        in the long run he will not be taken seriously, and if he be unfamiliar with
                        his audience he is likely to tread on somebody&apos;s toes without
                        intending it.</p>
                    <pb n="15" id="VAA3906-020"/>
                    <p>In the campaign where James D. Williams and Benjamin Harrison were opposing
                        candidates for the governorship of Indiana, we Republicans used to make
                        great fun of &quot;Blue Jeans,&quot; as we called him, ridiculing
                        his rustic manners and his homespun ways. We did n&apos;t make much by
                        it, for the people of Indiana were mostly farmers, and after he had been
                        elected and had made an honest, respectable, and sensible governor, our
                        campaign jokes looked rather pitiful in retrospect. One night I spoke at a
                        small neighborhood meeting, and repeated to my audience the following story
                        which was going the rounds:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Williams, who was then a member of Congress, was washing his hands at one
                        of the lavatories in the Capitol, when an attendant handed him three towels.
                        He sighed at such wanton extravagance and exclaimed: &quot;Why, down at
                        my farm we make a single towel last the family a weekI &quot;</p>
                    <p>This was a pretty poor story, but for all that I was astonished to see that
                        there was not a smile upon any of the faces before me; indeed, their
                        countenances took on even a deeper gloom. On my way home, <pb n="16"
                            id="VAA3906-021"/> as we drove through the woods, my companion said to
                        me:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You did n&apos;t make any great hit with your story about Blue
                        Jeans&apos;s towel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot; No, I did n&apos;t seem to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll tell you. There was n&apos;t a farmer in
                        that crowd that had n&apos;t done the same thing himself!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Even the story-teller, however, is far more effective than the solemn and
                        oracular wiseacre who, in slow and sepulchral tones, utters commonplaces as
                        impressively as if they were the emanations of divine wisdom. This style of
                        oratory is only endurable when it comes from a Senator or a member of the
                        Cabinet.</p>
                    <p>Then there is the man who begins with a long introduction and spends half his
                        time before he reaches the first point, working very hard to little purpose,
                        like a leaky bellows. Then there is the man who denounces everybody and thus
                        solidifies the ranks of the enemy until he is called off from his
                        unprofitable tour by the managing committee.</p>
                    <p>I used to go stumping with the distin- <pb n="17" id="VAA3906-022"/> guished
                        Colonel B--, who would talk of &quot;scoundrels and murderers,&quot;
                        and connect them in dome inscrutable way with &quot;the rotten old
                        Democratic party.&quot; When I would tell him that was not the way to
                        win Democratic votes, he would rejoin, &quot; But it <hi rend="i"
                            >is</hi> the rotten old Democratic party.&quot; His maxim evidently
                        was, &quot;Let the truth be spoken though the heavens fall.&quot;
                        Once a committee called upon me to protest against the Colonel&apos;s
                        violent epithets. I told them they had better call on the Colonel; that I
                        had already remonstrated, but that he had rejoined, &quot;It rouses the
                        people!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Denunciation is always dangerous unless it be during the last days of a
                        campaign, when party lines are tightly drawn, and the sole purpose of the
                        managers is to keep their men within the ranks.</p>
                    <p>There is a great difference among spellbinders in dramatic power. Many years
                        ago I had occasion to serve as chairman of a committee which investigated
                        certain serious abuses in the benevolent institutions of my State, notably
                        in the insane hospital. The condition of affairs was very crave. There was
                        evidence of extensive <pb n="18" id="VAA3906-023"/> corruption in the
                        contracts for supplies, unwholesome food was furnished to the patients at
                        extravagant prices, and they suffered greatly from the neglect and cruelty
                        of their attendants, who were appointed for political services under the
                        spoils system then prevailing. We exposed these iniquities in considerable
                        detail, and the issue became an important one in the next campaign. I was
                        speaking in the courthouse of one of our county towns with a young man who
                        has since become a United States Senator. I spoke first and related the
                        abuses we had discovered, making, as it seemed to me, a pretty strong case.
                        I had perhaps a better personal knowledge of the facts than any one outside
                        the institutions we investigated.</p>
                    <p>After I closed, my companion rose. He walked backwards and forwards along the
                        small open space reserved for the members of the bar, and drew a burning
                        picture of the horrors inflicted upon the helpless victims of madness. You
                        could smell the tainted meat and see the maggots in the butter on the tables
                        of the asylum; you could hear the blows of the brutal attendants upon the
                        backs of the patients; <pb n="19" id="VAA3906-024"/> you could listen to
                        their screams as the scalding water poured upon them in the bath-tubs where
                        they had been left by their drunken caretakers. So vivid was the scene that
                        the audience in the court-room became hysterical with sympathy and
                        indignation. To tell the truth, I never myself realized the enormity of the
                        outrages which I had taken so considerable a part in revealing until I heard
                        them described by the eloquent young orator who knew nothing at all about
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The conduct of a speaker is often the subject of ingenious comment and
                        conjecture. I once overheard two of my auditors discussing the question of
                        my religious belief. &quot; He is a Methodist,&quot; said one.
                        &quot;No, he&apos;s a Quaker,&quot; answered the other.
                        &quot;I tell you he&apos;s a Methodist,&quot; insisted the
                        first. &quot; Did n&apos;t you see the way he walked
                        around?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The similes and metaphors of the spellbinder who relies upon extemporaneous
                        inspiration are often inappropriate and sometimes sadly mixed. A Hoosier
                        orator, in delineating the noble character of General Hancock, announced
                        that &quot;his honor was as stainless as the sword that hung by <pb
                            n="20" id="VAA3906-025"/> his side at the battle of
                        Gettysburg!&quot; I was speaking once with a gentleman of broad culture
                        and national reputation, who, in describing the energy put into a
                        Presidential campaign, said that it was &quot;vast enough to stop and
                        dam Niagara till that great cataract should become a windmill made of
                        paper!&quot; This declaration was made with such impressive solemnity
                        that no one in the audience perceived any exaggeration or lack of propriety
                        in it, and yet upon reflection the transmutation of forces involved in
                        making a paper windmill out of Niagara by public speeches is something which
                        transcends not merely a scientific but even a poetic imagination. My friend
                        was talking from a platform raised sixteen or eighteen feet above the
                        ground, which may account for the loftiness of the conception.</p>
                    <p>Many speakers talk over the heads of their auditors. Their long words and
                        complex sentences fail to reach the men who hear them. Even physical
                        altitude sometimes has a disastrous effect. I once went out with a companion
                        to a country town. He spoke from the porch of a grocery store at some little
                        elevation from the street. <pb n="21" id="VAA3906-026"/> The audience was
                        inattentive and restless. I determined to get nearer to them, so I got down
                        into the street and harangued them with much better success. A few days
                        afterwards we had a meeting in a church. I spoke from the pulpit and found
                        very poor listeners. My companion profited by the lesson of the preceding
                        night and walked up and down the aisle. He made a great hit of it.</p>
                    <p>Much depends upon the acoustic properties of the hall. In some places, like
                        the Chicago Auditorium, a speaker can be heard in every part of the building
                        with scarcely any labor; in other places, sometimes even in small rooms, a
                        great deal of unnecessary energy has to be wasted in the mere effort to be
                        intelligible. Out-of-door meetings are usually the worst of all. As a rule,
                        a speaker can do better work in a hall which will hold a thousand persons
                        than he can in talking to five thousand in the open air. The confusion in
                        out-of-door meetings is very distracting.</p>
                    <p>I was much surprised, during the last Presidential campaign, at the
                        excellence of the music at some of the meetings, particularly from the local
                        bands. I think it <pb n="22" id="VAA3906-027"/> would astonish our friends
                        from the East, who are prone to believe that the Mississippi valley is quite
                        devoid of all appreciation of true art, to hear the music of some of these
                        country bands. The difficulty with them is that they seem to believe
                        (judging from the length of their performances in the hall, as well as from
                        the concerts they give just outside the door while the spellbinder is vainly
                        endeavoring to make himself heard inside) that <hi rend="i">they</hi> are
                        the principal attraction, a thing which may be true, but which we
                        spellbinders resent, believing that we ought ourselves to be the main
                        feature of a political meeting.</p>
                    <p>But a band is only one of the distractions against which we have to contend.
                        A drum corps is even a more formidable competitor, while railway whistles,
                        toot horns, cannon, and indiscriminate yells for different candidates form a
                        far less agreeable diversion. To speak against such opposition requires
                        nerve, composure, and lung power, if not ability.</p>
                    <p>It seems to be a well-accepted axiom that noise is the most important part of
                        a campaign; not only more vital than argument, but more convincing even than
                        uniforms, <pb n="23" id="VAA3906-028"/> illumination, or fireworks. Witness
                        the exhortation of a disgusted committeeman to a silent
                        torch-bearer-&quot;Yell! or drop yer torch!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sometimes noise is all that is really expected even from a speaker. When I
                        helped Governor H- open the campaign down at Mt. Vernon the chairman said to
                        me: &quot; Lord, <hi rend="i">they</hi> don&apos;t want no argyment!
                        Just whoop her up!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The campaign speaker never knows what is in store for him. He may arrive at
                        the station and find a brass band, a procession with ifoddess of liberty on
                        a &quot;float,&quot; and a carriage draped with American flags and
                        ornamented with pictures of the candidates, or he may be obliged to walk
                        through the streets alone and have some trouble in hunt- ing up the
                        committeeman. He may find that his fame has preceded him, or he may discover
                        from the spelling on the posters that the local managers do not know his
                        name.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the worst example of indifference on record was that related by
                        General M-, a distinguished old campaigner of my own State. When he came to
                        the station at the place where he was to speak, <pb n="24" id="VAA3906-029"
                        /> he said that at first he could not even find the town. It was growing
                        dark; there was nothing in sight and no lights were visible. At last he
                        followed a fellow-passenger along a footpath across a wide common, and
                        finally came upon some houses. It was just the hour of the meeting, so he
                        had to go without his supper. He found the hall by following a few
                        straggling villagers who climbed an outside stairway to a room above a
                        store. Nobody was in charge of the gathering, but after inquiry he learned
                        that a person of his name was expected to address the meeting, so he
                        introduced himself and made his speech.</p>
                    <p>The spellbinder must not be too particular about his accommodations. He must
                        go to the hotel where the committee sends him, for if a Republican speaker
                        betakes himself to the Democrtic tavern or a Democratic orator becomes a
                        guest at the Republican inn, the party may long be rent by grievous local
                        dissensions. Often the spellbinder who can neither see things nor smell
                        things is the happiest. I was awakened one morning on my last campaigning
                        tour by the strident voices of two females in an adjoining room. There had
                        been a protest <pb n="25" id="VAA3906-030"/> of some kind from one of them,
                        to which the other screamed the crushing rejoinder, &quot;Well, if the
                        floor&apos;s too dirty for ye to dress on, can&apos;t you git up on
                        a cheer?&quot; The conversation was justified by the surroundings.</p>
                    <p>At many places the campaigner may get into trouble if he does not understand
                        the local arrangements. Several years ago I was campaigning with Colonel X-
                        in Orange County, a rough, hilly neighborhood, in which at that time there
                        were no railroads. We were to speak in the court-house at Paoli, the
                        county-seat. There was a clean little country tavern in the town. You
                        entered a wide hall, at the end of which there was a small washroom with a
                        wooden sink and a tin basin, and just above was a cask with a spigot, which
                        presumably held the water for washing. The colonel was always particular
                        about his personal appearance. He had in former years held a position of
                        some importance in the foreign service of the Government, and as he was the
                        older man I always yielded him precedence, a courtesy which he seemed to
                        appreciate. So his turn at that wash-basin came first. He <pb n="26"
                            id="VAA3906-031"/> took off his coat with considerable deliberation,
                        rolled up his shirt sleeves, turned on the spigot, and filled the basin, but
                        no sooner did I hear the swish of the liquid on his face and hands than he
                        leaped back, stamped furiously upon the floor, and swore as I never heard
                        man swear before. &quot; What is the matter?&quot; I asked.
                        &quot;Oh, damn it! It&apos;s coal oil !&quot; was the despairing
                        answer. I maintained a respectful distance from the colonel during the next
                        few days.</p>
                    <p>The spellbinder sees more &quot;local color&quot; in his
                        peregrinations than any other kind of traveller. He must shake hands with
                        everybody, and generally he is introduced to a crank or to some Greenbacker
                        or &quot;universal peace man&quot; with belligerent tendencies, or
                        more commonly some uncompromising Prohibitionist, with whom he is expected
                        to &quot;square things&quot; in behalf of the party, and the arguing
                        that goes on in the midst of a knot of bystanders would furnish
                        entertainment to Bedlam.</p>
                    <p>The spellbinder has to concede a great deal to local prejudices. I once drove
                        to a village in the northern part of my own county. and lust before I
                        reached it I was <pb n="27" id="VAA3906-032"/> met by the local manager.
                        &quot;Good God! you&apos;re not going to drive into Smalltown with
                        your own carriage and coachman?&quot; I had no denial to interpose, for
                        the evidence against me was at hand. So I feebly asked: &quot;Why
                        not?&quot; He answered: &quot;Why, you couldn&apos;t undo the
                        damage in ten speeches! Hitch the horses here in the woods, and if your
                        driver wants to go to the meeting let him come in from the other side of the
                        town!&quot; All which was done in concession to local sensibilities.</p>
                    <p>There is a great deal of wear and tear in a campaign. You are often up all
                        night; you talk till your clothes are wringing wet, and then drive a dozen
                        miles across the country. You have to put up with all sorts of fare; you run
                        the risk of malaria. There are some who break down under the strain and have
                        to cancel their engagements. And yet, except for our throats, I believe the
                        majority of us come out of a campaign in better condition than we enter it,
                        especially if we have no personal care or anxiety concerning the canvass.
                        Really there are few better kinds of exercise than public speaking. It <pb
                            n="28" id="VAA3906-033"/> expands the lungs, develops the muscles of the
                        arms and legs, and keeps the brain active at the same time. What other kind
                        of athletics can furnish all these desiderata? If you can preserve your
                        good-nature, keep your appetite, and make up in the morning the sleep you
                        lose at night, there is no reason why a campaign should not make you
                        stronger and healthier than ever.</p>
                    <p>The spellbinder (especially if his services are gratuitous) will be received
                        in the committee rooms of his party with exuberant hospitality, testified to
                        by a slap on the back, and an invitation to make himself perfectly at home,
                        as much as in his own house.&apos; There are perhaps a score of people
                        in two or three small rooms, containing only half a dozen chairs, and
                        everybody hard at work, so the invitation, although cordial, does not always
                        assure the spellbinder of comfortable accommodation. But the chairman of the
                        speakers&apos; bureau will tell him of the wonderful effect produced at
                        the meeting at Jonesboro by his eloquent words. He will assure him that
                        since he is one of the most distinguished orators in the nation, the party
                        must have his services for <pb n="29" id="VAA3906-034"/> the entire
                        campaign. When he has succumbed to these blandishments and feels that, like
                        Gil Bias, he is the eighth wonder of the world, he is sent to Pinhook, a
                        place the Railway Guide, to talk to a score of farmers who never heard of
                        him until they were informed by the same party manager that he is one of the
                        greatest statesmen and most magnificent orators in the country. Titles are
                        added to his name which he never possessed before. I have been announced as
                        Colonel, Judge, Member of Congress, Member of the Paris Peace Commission, of
                        the Venezuela Commission, etc., until these titles, by reason of long usage,
                        now repose gracefully upon my brow. Perhaps the most remarkable claim to
                        public consideration was that which I found awaiting me when I arrived at an
                        Illinois town and saw myself advertised, in large posters, as a statistician
                        of national reputation, and the people were urged to &quot;Turn Out and
                        Hear the Great Statistician!&quot; Statistics give me the nightmare, and
                        I should have thought that this would have been enough to keep everybody
                        from going to the hall. But after supper a large band <pb n="30"
                            id="VAA3906-035"/> came up to the door of the hotel and I was invited to
                        follow it. There were perhaps forty persons in the band, and the procession
                        behind it seemed rather small for such a cortge, since it consisted of only
                        three persons, the Eminent Statistician in the middle, flanked by the county
                        committeeman on one side and the district committeeman on the other. In
                        solemn state we marched around the public square and entered the hall, which
                        I was surprised to find comfortably filled. The people of that town
                        evidently had no horror of statistics.</p>
                    <p>Still more surprising, however, was the attitude of the inhabitants of a
                        prosperous manufacturing town in the State of Maine. At this place I spoke
                        with a United States Senator, and was astonished to notice the intense
                        interest which the audience gave to the figures by means of which he deduced
                        the national and local prosperity resulting from the tariff. There was a
                        convincing power in his 567,698,475 dollars and 69 cents, particularly in
                        the cents, which no other form of argument or rhetoric could apparently have
                        supplied. I followed the Senator with some remarks upon other subjects which
                        I thought ought to be interesting, <pb n="31" id="VAA3906-036"/> but I
                        observed that my hearers became restless and some of them left the hall.
                        Seeing how well the Senator had done with his statistics, I tried a few
                        figures myself, and was surprised to notice that so long as they held out
                        the patience of my audience held out too, but that when my figures failed
                        the endurance of my audience gave way, so that I had to bring my speech to a
                        hasty conclusion. Should this eagerness for statistics become general, a
                        friend of mine suggests that actuaries and bookkeepers may soon furnish the
                        most valuable aid to our speaking campaign and that the statistical
                        spellbinder will finally supersede the Demostheneses and Ciceros of the past
                        and the present.</p>
                    <p>A new convert is very valuable as a campaign speaker, but the excellence of
                        his argument is quite a secondary matter when compared with his value for
                        exhibition purposes as a recruit. He is especially in demand if it can be
                        said of him that his father, his brother, or, better still, every member of
                        his family belongs and has for generations belonged to the opposite party,
                        as showing through what tremendous obstacles of blood and environment he has
                            <pb n="32" id="VAA3906-037"/> worked his way up from darkness into
                        light. I have sometimes been surprised to find myself advertised as one who
                        had thus forsaken the pathway of error, the attraction on this account being
                        perhaps even greater than the putative judgeship, senatorship, or colonelcy
                        with which my name was also connected.</p>
                    <p>In one district I visited, the managers had secured a gem of peculiar lustre,
                        a young fellow whose father was then engaged in campaigning for the other
                        side, and who was sent to follow his progenitor around the State and answer
                        him at the same places a night or two afterwards, telling to enthusiastic
                        audiences how the old man had beguiled him four years ago, but could never
                        do it again.</p>
                    <p>The blandishments offered by the political manager to the spellbinder must
                        not be too severely censured, for the poor committeeman is between the devil
                        and the deep sea. On the one hand are the many spellbinders, each insisting
                        upon the best appointments in the country-men to whom the Chicago Auditorium
                        and the Metropolitan Opera House in New York seem the fittest places for the
                        display of their capa- <pb n="33" id="VAA3906-038"/> bilities; and on the
                        other hand there is an infinite number of local communities, each demanding
                        the best speaker that the country affords. Every village wants to hear
                        Roosevelt, Bryan, Cockran, or Depew. What then is left for the poor manager
                        to do except to exalt Smith or Jones to a national rank, to proclaim that he
                        is something &quot;equally as good&quot; as Beveridge or Dolliver or
                        Hill, and on the other hand to exalt each cross-roads neighborhood to a
                        place of vital importance in the campaign, almost as essential to party
                        success as Chicago and New York, and to promise a vast audience from the
                        surrounding country? Of course there is disappointment on both sides. The
                        spellbinder foams at the mouth when he realizes that the man who flattered
                        him is a deceiver, while the people at the cross-roads denounce the central
                        committee for sending them a gas-bag in place of an rator. But what else can
                        they do? The most thankless place in a campaign is a place on the executive
                        committee, especially at the head of the speakers&apos; bureau.</p>
                    <p>We spellbinders are by nature a conceited tribe, and sometimes in our inter-
                            <pb n="34" id="VAA3906-039"/> course with each other many of us realize
                        that celebrated definition of a bore-&quot;A man who insists upon
                        talking about himself when you want to talk about yourself. I have found
                        many spelbinders of this kind. They relate their forensic triumphs in terms
                        that defy all competition. Some of them are even mathematical in describing
                        their powers of persuasion. Who, for instance, could hope to excel the
                        magnetic power of the orator who exultantly announced in the rooms of the
                        National Committee that at Brownstown he had had &quot;eleven applauses
                        and three &apos;go ons&apos;&quot;?</p>
                    <p>Conscious as he always is of his own excellence, the spellbinder is sure to
                        meet many trials and disappointments. Perhaps his meeting has not been
                        properly announced, and he finds only a few straggling guests to partake of
                        his teeming banquet of eloquence. That is hard enough, but even worse is it
                        when there is a large gathering and another man speaks first at great
                        length, leaving him nothing but the remnants both of the time and the
                        audience. How tedious and dull was the speech of that first fellow, who thus
                        deprives an unconscious multitutle of something more <pb n="35"
                            id="VAA3906-040"/> valuable and attractive! Perhaps the hardest trial to
                        the spellbinder is to find, after he has been sent to a large city in which
                        he supposes he is to be the central and sole attraction, that he is only one
                        of a cargo of eloquence shipped at the same time to the same place for the
                        same purpose.</p>
                    <p>But, in spite of these drawbacks, I think most of us still consider
                        campaigning good fun, and however welcome the home circle and a little rest
                        after a month or two spent upon a stumping tour, I am sure that nearly all
                        of us will be ready to try it again after four years.</p>
                    <p>The concluding page of the spellbinder&apos;s duty remains to be written.
                        After the campaign is over and the votes are cast, he still must
                        &quot;ratify.&quot; If he is at headquarters when the news of
                        victory comes, this is a simple matter-one more speech with louder
                        interruptions and greater enthusiasm than ever, and his work is over. If he
                        belongs to the defeated party, the thing is still simpler. He has only to
                        crawl into his hole. But quite different is it with the spellbinder on the
                        victorious side, if his confidence has been so great as to stifle his
                        curiosity and he has presumed to go <pb n="36" id="VAA3906-041"/> to bed
                        before ascertaining the result. A distant but constantly increasing noise of
                        horns and drums and cheers breaks in upon his slumbers; next, word is
                        brought that a crowd is seen coming up the drive. With shrieks and yells
                        under his window they demand a speech. Then he goes forth upon the balcony,
                        clad perchance in a huge overcoat, which supplies the lack of more
                        appropriate apparel, and there, still half asleep, he talks incoherently and
                        waves his hands. But whatever he says, it is enough. The pounding on the tin
                        pans, the hurrahs, the waving of the dead rooster from the pole, fill every
                        hiatus, until the crowd departs and he tumbles into bed again, where
                        &quot;The Fairies&apos; Midwife &quot;touches his silver tongue
                        and he dreams of postmasterships, collectorships, and other fair forms of
                        continuing and increasing prosperity such as are wont to follow the
                        footsteps of successful eloquence.</p>
                    <p>And before any grim awakening shall mar his visions, here let us leave
                        him.</p>

                    <p>UP to within recent period royal, or even a noble, ancestry in this country
                        has, in general, been the exclusive possession of the families that have
                        been best able to pay for it. For some inscrutable reason, a coat-of-arms
                        and a large and recently acquired fortune have frequently gone together.</p>
                    <p>It has always seemed to me that there was an essential injustice in this
                        partiality of genealogy to wealth, and that the harmless delight of
                        contemplating a magnificent ancestry ought to be, like other gifts of
                        Nature, free to all, or at least accessible to those of modest purses. It is
                        therefore a source of pride that I am an humble member of a family through
                        whom this reform has actually been inaugurated.</p>
                    <p>The Foulke family, composed of the <pb n="38" id="VAA3906-043"/> descendants
                        of Edward Foulke, an early settler of Gwynedd, Montgomery County, Pa., held
                        a reunion a few years since, at which about six hundred members, in good
                        health and condition, met to celebrate the two-hundredth anniversary of the
                        immigration of their common ancestor.</p>
                    <p>The traditions of the family, as well as certain parish records and
                        monumental inscriptions, trace its origin to one Rhirid Flaidd, a Welsh
                        chieftain of the time of Henry II., and we Foulkes regarded with quite
                        sufficient complacency a line of ancestors who, if not very eminent, were
                        numerous, some of them quite ancient, and most of them entirely
                        respectable.</p>
                    <p>Philadelphia is the natural home of gene alogy. To a Philadelphian an ample
                        pedigree is better than great riches. Pennsylvania has a Genealogical
                        Society whose members exhibit unwearied diligence in the study of heraldic
                        literature. A family history like that of the Foulkes, when it reaches the
                        ken of the Pennsylvania genealogist, falls upon rich ground; upon soil as
                        fertile for the reproduction and multiplication of illustrious pedigrees as
                        is the red clay of Cuba for the cultivation of the sugar-cane. The result
                            <pb n="39" id="VAA3906-044"/> of the reunion of the Foulke family was
                        the preparation and exhibition of eight genealogical tables showing
                        thedescent of Edward and Eleanor Foulke, compiled by one of the members of
                        the Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania. These have now been reproduced in
                        book form and purchased by various members of the family, to whose
                        astonished eyes they reveal a luxuriant prodigality of noble and royal
                        ancestry which, it is safe to say, can rarely be matched in history.</p>
                    <p>Table I. shows the descent from ancient British kings, beginning with Glouyw
                        Glwad Lydan, King and founder of the city of Caer Louyw or Gloucester,
                        thence through the great Vortigern elected King of Britain A.D. 425, who
                        espoused Severs, daughter of Maximus Magnus, Roman Emperor, beheaded A.D.
                        388; to Brochwel Ysgythrog, King of Powys (where under the sun is the
                        kingdom of Powys?) and Prince of Chester, slain in battle against the Saxons
                        on the banks of the Dee, A.D. 612; and to his descendant, Sir Griffith
                        Vaughan, created Knight Benneret at the battle of Agincourt, whose daughter
                        Anne married Ieven Vychan. of Llanuwchllyn, <pb n="40" id="VAA3906-045"/>
                        from whom Edward Foulke was eighth in descent, as shown in Table V.</p>
                    <p>What heart is there that will not swell with pride when it learns for the
                        first time that the blood of the Emperor Maximus Magnus flows through its
                        ventricles? What soul so dead that it will not stir with wrath on reading in
                        the Epistle of Gildas, an early Anglo-Saxon chronicler, certain unjust
                        aspersions upon the character of this imperial ancestor?</p>
                    <p>Shade of the mighty though decapitated Maximus! Whether thy head hang upon
                        some Elysian bough or float on Phlegethonian flames, let it console thee to
                        know that we, thy remote posterity, the distant scions of the
                        &quot;Greatest Great,&quot; are ready to wage implacable vendetta
                        against the Saxon churl who has defamed thee!</p>
                    <p>In these days when new societies are being organized every year to illustrate
                        the greatness of the progenitors of those who compose them, it would seem
                        fair that competition in ancestry should have the widest possible
                        development. The &quot;Daughters of the Revolution&quot; must give
                        way to the &quot;Colonial Dames&quot; that antedate them. The
                        &quot;Colonial Dames&quot; must always take <pb n="41"
                            id="VAA3906-046"/> a subordinate place by the side of the
                        &quot;American Queens,&quot; or &quot;Order of the
                        Crown,&quot; composed of the descendants of royal houses. Why should not
                        these in turn yield the palm to an order, &quot;Descendants of the Roman
                        Emperors&quot;? Such a fraternity ought no longer to delay its
                        appearance.</p>
                    <p>Table II. of the Foulke genealogy &quot;is devoted to the descent from
                        Bleddyn ab Cynfyn to Gruffudd Vychan, Baron of Glyndffrdwy, whose wife was
                        Eleanor, daughter of Thomas ab Lewellyn, a lineal descendant of Edward I.,
                        King of England, as shown in Table VII.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The genealogist evidently does not intend to let King Edward get away from
                        the family, and an additional safety attachment is provided in Tables 111,
                        and IV., which &quot;trace the descent from Roderick the Great (Roderig
                        Mawr), King of all Wales in 843, to Llewellyn ab Owain, who married Eleanor
                        de Barr, granddaughter of Edward I.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But the gem of the collection is Table VII., which &quot;shows the
                        descent of Edward Foulke from the Saxon, Norman, German, Castilian, and
                        Scottish roval houses <pb n="42" id="VAA3906-047"/> of the eleventh century,
                        through the marriage of Eleanor, daughter of Thomas ab Llewellyn, to
                        Gruffydd Vychan, Baron of Glyndffrdwy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It will be seen from this that very little of the royalty of Europe has
                        managed to escape from the ancestry of the family. It is to be regretted
                        that the Grand Princes of Moscow, the Shahs of Persia, and the Emperors of
                        China cannot as yet be clearly identified, but it is to be hoped that time
                        and a still more exhaustive research by the Genealogical Society of
                        Pennsylvania will at last supply the broken links which connect us with
                        these dynasties.</p>
                    <p>Even the best antiquarians, however, are sure to encounter unreasonable
                        criticism. A friend writes me that a Pennsylvania genealogist has small
                        cause to plume himself on the results of his work if, having once reached a
                        royal family, he can go no farther back than a Roman Emperor of the fourth
                        century, since it is well known that the heralds who investigated the
                        pedigrees of those royal families traced them without interruption to the
                        Kings of Israel, to the patriarchs, to our good father Noah, and finally to
                        our common parents in the Gar- <pb n="43" id="VAA3906-048"/> den of Eden. He
                        further tells me that these heralds described minutely the coats-of-arms of
                        all these ancient worthies, though there is still doubt as to which of the
                        devices attributed to Noah was the true one. Was it a dove volant, or a
                        whole menagerie passant? My friend inclines to the latter opinion, and gives
                        as his reason that many of the descendants of Noah having adopted various
                        selections from this menagerie, there is no other evidence of their right to
                        do this except the fact that <hi rend="i">all</hi> the animals in question
                        were properly blazoned on the shield of their common ancestor at the time
                        when they passed into the ark, and my friend rejects as totally inadmissible
                        the suggestion made by some that Noah&apos;s device represented Mount
                        Ararat rampant, surmounted by an ark couchant, and encircled by a grapevine;
                        for, as he justly observes, although such a device might be valuable
                        historically, <foreign rend="i">in perpetuam rei mnemoiam</foreign>, it is
                        neither heroic nor heraldic.</p>
                    <p>I was at first inclined to agree with my friend, that our Pennsylvania
                        genealogist was remiss in failing to graft the Foulke pedigree upon that of
                        the royal families in question, thus connecting us at once with <pb n="44"
                            id="VAA3906-049"/> the ultimate source and root of all genealogy; and I
                        felt this the more deeply when I compared the imperfect traditions of my own
                        family with that of a Philadelphia lady whom I met at a summer
                        watering-place, and who, speaking of her ancestors, said, with that quiet
                        gravity which was the best guaranty of her good faith as well as her good
                        breeding, &quot;We can trace every link in our chain of descent from
                        Adam the son of God.&quot; But then came the thought that after this
                        supreme goal of genealogical art had once been reached, and it was proved
                        beyond doubt that we were descended from Adam and his rib, in what would
                        this give us any claim to superiority over the rest of mankind? It is
                        perhaps better that our family genealogist stopped at one of the
                        intermediate stages.</p>
                    <p>The Foulke pedigree has been subject to other irreverent observations by the
                        uninformed, and in regard to the twenty-six coats-of-arms which
                        &quot;with their heraldic descriptions are distributed through the
                        tables, all based upon authority,&quot; one skeptic thinks it
                        extraordinary that the Welsh tribesmen who had no coats to their backs
                        should leam forth in history as possessors <pb n="45" id="VAA3906-050"/> of
                        brilliant coats-of-arms. Such criticism is doubtless due to the
                        critic&apos;s still more scanty knowledge of their actual apparel.</p>
                    <p>One member of the family, using the answer of Artemus Ward to the matrimonial
                        proposals of the Mormon widows, said that it was &quot;the
                        muchness&quot; of these ancestors that he objected to; that he did not
                        mind a duke or two, or even a king, but he did not want so many of them.
                        Such moderation is manifestly impossible when intermarriages between royal
                        families are considered. If you are willing to take one king for a
                        progenitor you may have to take a hundred. In the matter of royal ancestors,
                        as well as of intoxicants, there is no perfect safety except in total
                        abstinence.</p>
                    <p>But the marvel, as well as the chief advantage, of these tables is that they
                        are offered at the low price of three dollars per copy. The man who will not
                        give that trifling sum for such splendid progenitors must be insensible to
                        the calls of fame and to all noble aspirations.</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that the step thus taken toward the democratization of
                        royal and noble blood will be generally followed, and, although few families
                        can hope to vie in <pb n="46" id="VAA3906-051"/> ancestry with the
                        variegated luxuriance that of the family of Foulke, that all may in time
                        find some sort of nobility, and even royalty, within easy reach, thanks to
                        the diligence of the Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania.</p>

                    <head rend="center">MY DOG</head>
                    <p>I ALWAYS had bad luck with dogs. I bought a black and tan, he ran away; a
                        Scotch terrier, he was stolen; a spotted coach dog, and I don&apos;t
                        know what became of him. I have one now that I got when he was a puppy in
                        order that the children might &quot;train him.&quot; They did so,
                        and this dog is in great peril of assassination.</p>
                    <p>The only dog I had who was &quot;ever faithful&quot; was Prince.
                        Prince was not exactly my dog-that is, he was never formally transferred to
                        me by any one,- but we went to Long Branch every summer, and a few days
                        after our arrival Prince would come to visit us, and he always prolonged his
                        visit until we left in the fall. I can not say exactly what kind of a dog
                        Prince was; in fact, I do not recollect ever having seen any of the breed
                        elsewhere, <pb n="48" id="VAA3906-053"/> which leads me to think it must be
                        rare. I will describe him, and those better informed can draw their
                        conclusions. He was about two feet and a half long, with a big round body
                        set about three inches above the ground upon four little fat legs. These
                        legs had remarkable sinuosities which are hard to describe, but whether they
                        were the result of a peculiarity in the stock, or of early misfortune in
                        this particular dog, I am not able to say. He had large fat feet, almost as
                        big as the rest of his legs, and the toes of the front feet turned out so
                        decidedly that the footprints would indicate the dog was going in two
                        opposite directions at the same time. His prevailing color was yellow,
                        interspersed with spots of brownish clay color and dirty white. He was
                        further often adorned with splashes of mud. His hair was thick and shaggy,
                        and hung over his eyes. If you stroked him (which you did not often do), you
                        could feel the burrs under his long, coarse hair, and quantities of small
                        shot beneath his skin-deposited there by the neighbors in vain efforts to
                        shorten his existence. If any one should recognize the breed from this
                        description, he will proba- <pb n="49" id="VAA3906-054"/> bly know that
                        there are two qualities for which dogs of this kind can be recommended. The
                        first is their indestructibility, and the second, their adhesiveness to any
                        one who will give them something to eat. Three several times was that dog
                        thrown into a cistern, and three several times did Providence interpose by a
                        miracle to save his life. Nothing short of supernatural assistance could
                        account for his invulnerability to stones, bricks, tin pans, and every other
                        conceivable missile hurled at him by an outraged public.</p>
                    <p>Prince had a discriminating mind; he always knew just whom to bite. A party
                        of young rascals could steal into our melon patch at night and empty it
                        without the slightest risk, but a friend who came to visit us was always in
                        danger, and did not often escape without damage to his raiment and his skin.
                        Prince was the best known dog in the neighborhood; I think our family was
                        chiefly distinguished in the place because we belonged to that dog. For some
                        reason we were not popular, our characters being judged by the company we
                        kept.</p>
                    <p>Prince was old when he first came to us, <pb n="50" id="VAA3906-055"/> but he
                        lived with us for ten summers and never seemed to grow any older. His best
                        trait was his affection for &quot;Auntie,&quot; the one human being
                        on earth who could tolerate him. Indeed, much of her time was passed in
                        fruitless efforts to screen his character from the calumnies of an unjust
                        world. Prince followed her everywhere, snapping at every one that passed, as
                        the suspected enemy of his mistress; and she declared that he was at heart
                        really one of the best dogs in the world, but much misunderstood. And when
                        he kept us awake at night howling hyena-like in the front yard, she would
                        patiently listen to the noise for hours, regarding it as only another
                        evidence of his wonderful faithfulness.</p>
                    <p>At last, however, even Prince went the way of all the earth. One summer we
                        returned and he was no longer there to meet us.</p>
                    <p>But <hi rend="i">my</hi> dog <foreign rend="i">par excellence</foreign> was
                        Drapeau. There was no difficulty in telling what kind of a dog <hi rend="i"
                            >he</hi> was. He was a St. Bernard, bought from the monks at the
                        Hospice.</p>
                    <p>It was in the summer of 1872. I had been climbing, with a companion and a
                        guide, across glaciers, around the Matter- <pb n="51" id="VAA3906-056"
                        />horn, over the St. Theodule Pass, down to Breuil and Val Tournanche, in
                        Italy. Thence we proceeded to Aosta, and back again to Switerland by way of
                        the St. Bernard. We had left the little village of St. Remy, on the Italian
                        side, and night overtook us while we were in the midst of the clouds. We
                        could not see an arm&apos;s length before us; we could only tell we were
                        upon the path because it felt differently under our feet from the sharper
                        rocks on either side. We could hear the roaring of water far down upon the
                        left, and felt that we must be close to the brink of the precipice, with
                        high cliffs on the other side. Our alpenstocks alone preserved us from the
                        danger of pitching headlong into space. We groped on in the darkness for a
                        long while, making very little headway. Our guide was a cheerful individual,
                        who amused us with stories of travellers that had been waylaid and killed in
                        the neighborhood a short time previous. In an hour or two we came to a
                        little <foreign rend="i">cantine</foreign>, where we found some drunken
                        Italians, and from them we borrowed a lantern, by which we could see the
                        path perhaps two or three feet ahead. It was nearly midnight when we <pb
                            n="52" id="VAA3906-057"/> reached the Hospice. The first sign that we
                        were near it was the barking of the great dogs, and never was sound more
                        grateful to the ear. One of the brothers gave us a good supper, and assigned
                        us clean, comfortable beds. I had long wanted a St. Bernard dog, a real one
                        from the Hospice, one of the life-savers, whose pictures I had seen in
                        childhood, licking the faces of travellers that had fallen unconscious in
                        the snow. Next morning we rose early to start for Martigny, and the monk who
                        had entertained us had the dogs brought out from their kennels that I might
                        take my choice. They bounded about, eight big burly fellows, barking and
                        capering like mad. I selected Drapeau, one of the largest. The monk gave me
                        his history, telling me that the dog had taken part in saving several lives,
                        and was regarded as a very valuable animal. The keeper of the dogs
                        accompanied us to a <foreign rend="i">cantine</foreign>, three miles below,
                        where we were to take a wagon. Drapeau followed us on the way down; he was
                        an immense, tan-colored, short-haired animal, much like a lioness in
                        appearance, capering about with all the delight of life and liberty in the
                        cool <pb n="53" id="VAA3906-058"/> morning air. His ankles were as thick as
                        my two fists, and his neck and shoulders were enormous.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the <foreign rend="i">cantine</foreign>, we lifted him into a wagon
                        and I held on to his large leather collar to prevent him from getting away,
                        but the moment we started and he saw that his master was not there, he
                        leaped out and hung by the collar, struggling fiercely. It was easy to see
                        that we could not carry him down in that fashion, so we hired his keeper to
                        ride with us to Martigny. It would take the man two days to go and return,
                        but there was no other way to transport the dog.</p>
                    <p>When Drapeau saw his master in the wagon he became quiet. But as soon as we
                        reached the valley the poor animal began to suffer greatly. He was used to
                        the cold mountain air, and the hot noonday sun in the lower altitude was too
                        much for him. The motion of the wagon, too, made him horribly seasick, and
                        we feared that we never should get him to Martigny alive. When we reached
                        the inn the dog was so weak he could hardly drag one foot after another. He
                        would neither eat nor drink, and he looked forlorn.</p>
                    <pb n="54" id="VAA3906-059"/>
                    <p>Early in the afternoon the train started for Geneva. On the Continent there
                        is a special place in all the trains for dogs, a small compartment in the
                        luggage van, with a window at each side, and special
                        &quot;dog-tickets&quot; have to be purchased. We crowded Drapeau
                        into one of these compartments, fastened him in securely, and the train
                        started. Near the head of Lake Geneva you change cars. Of course I thought
                        the dog would be transferred by the porters, and I seated myself comfortably
                        in the other train. Soon it started, and what was my surprise to see Drapeau
                        looking sadly out from his little window in the train we had just left.
                        Luckily, our train switched back to the station. Here I bustled about among
                        the guards and porters, ordering them to transfer my dog, but they shrugged
                        their shoulders exasperatingly as they answered, &quot;<foreign rend="i"
                            >C&apos;est a vous, monsieur</foreign>.</p>
                    <p>It was not easy to move that leviathan, but finally, with the assistance of
                        my companion and two liberally bribed attendants, we dragged him out, each
                        holding a leg, and forcibly projected him into the dog-quarters of the new
                        train. Drapeau was <pb n="55" id="VAA3906-060"/> too badly used up to
                        resist. He could hardly breathe. But about six o&apos;clock in the
                        afternoon, when we reached Geneva, the air became fresher, and he plucked up
                        courage. The next problem was to get him to the hotel. We dragged him from
                        his compartment, and hauled him through the station to a cab. In the cab
                        Drapeau&apos;s vigor seemed to be entirely restored, for it took the
                        full strength of both of us to keep him from jumping out of the window, and
                        a yelling crowd of small boys followed us through the streets. At the
                            <foreign>Hotel de la Paix</foreign> the guests were just walking in to
                        dinner. All stopped to look, and found us amusing. We were a picturesque
                        sight with our alpenstocks, our leggings and spiked shoes, our flannel
                        shirts, and our begrimed and travel-worn appearance (the result of a
                        week&apos;s tramp), hanging on for dear life to a big dog to prevent his
                        getting away. The porter told us of stable near by, where he thought they
                        would keep the animal, and we had him conveyed thither. It turned out to be
                        a poor place for him, and so, a few days later, I marched with him myself
                        four miles along the dusty roads south of the lake, and left him in <pb
                            n="56" id="VAA3906-061"/> charge of a farmer in the neighborhood who
                        kept a &quot;dog hotel&quot; of the most approved variety. My banker
                        was to pay him a <foreign>franc</foreign> a day until Drapeau left for
                        Paris. Then I went to Italy. In Rome I received a letter from the farmer,
                        telling me he was &apos;desolate to inform Monsieur that he could not
                        longer keep Monsieur&apos;s dog for less than two francs a
                        day.&apos; &quot; He kills my chickens, he fights with my other
                        dogs, he leaps my fence, which you know is a high one, and three times I
                        must walk to Geneva to restore him.&quot; I could make no other
                        arrangement, so the two francs had to be paid.</p>
                    <p>When at last I reached Paris, I ordered Drapeau sent on to me. It was
                        thirty-six hours from Geneva to Paris by the omnibus-train, and the dog had
                        to be fed. So a sort of travelling apartment, a huge crate, was built for
                        him, and plentifully supplied with straw. There was a trough for his food,
                        and a large quantity of meat was provided. At Paris the hotel porter went
                        with me to the station for the dog. We had to break up the crate with an axe
                        before we could get him out. Then there was a scene quite like the one at
                        Geneva, <pb n="57" id="VAA3906-062"/> the dog being thrust into a cab that
                        would hardly hold both him and the very unhappy man who clung desperately to
                        his collar, seeking to repress his frantic efforts at leaping out of the
                        window. In this manner we were driven through the streets of Paris, attended
                        by a horde of uproarious <foreign rend="i">gamins</foreign> who ran along
                        the side of the cab, delighted at the unaccustomed spectacle. At length we
                        stopped at the door of a dog fancier&apos;s, and when Drapeau entered he
                        was saluted by a vigorous barking from perhaps a score of different kinds of
                        dogs that were chained against the wall. A deep low growl was his answer,
                        and it was followed by instant silence among his awe-stricken auditors. But
                        it was soon clear that he could not stay long amid such surroundings. His
                        presence ruined the happiness and threatened the lives of the other dogs in
                        the establishment. So I rented a vacant lot surrounded by a high fence, and
                        in it a suitable dog-house was constructed. The keeper I had engaged agreed
                        to take Drapeau each day for a walk on the boulevard, while I was to be
                        absent for a month in Spain.</p>
                    <p>When I returned to Paris, the <foreign rend="i">portier</foreign> at the
                        hotel came to me with a sad face and said: <pb n="58" id="VAA3906-063"/>
                        <q rend="blockquote">&apos;Ah, Monsieur, I must tell you of a great
                            calamity. Monsieur&apos;s dog was walking on the Boulevard one day
                            with his keeper, and he saw the dog of a cetain Major Duval. The Major
                            slipped and fell, and his dog started to run, when Monsieur&apos;s
                            dog, no doubt attributing some fault to the dog of the Major, broke away
                            from his chain and instantly destroyed the dog of the Major, and
                            Monsieur has been condemned in the court to pay a fine of four hundred
                            francs for the destruction of this dog, and Monsieur&apos;s dog has
                            been arrested as security for that sum.&quot;</q></p>
                    <p>Investigating the matter, I found this was only too true. I sought Major
                        Duval, in the hope of making some reasonable composition, but he grew so
                        fervid in his praises of the wonderful qualities of the dog Drapeau had
                        killed that I was grateful the judgment against me was no heavier, and I
                        paid it.</p>
                    <p>I could not bring Drapeau to America on the steamer on which I had taken
                        passage, since that particular line &quot;would not take dogs,&quot;
                        so sent him by a French line, in care of the butcher. I met the vessel on
                        its arrival, and found Drapeau chained to one of the bulwarks, with
                        bloodshot eyes, looking misanthropic. Two or three sailors as they passed
                        exclaimed, <foreign rend="i">&quot;Q&apos;il est mechant!
                            &quot;</foreign> So this beneficent creature of the Hospice had been
                        trans- <pb n="59" id="VAA3906-064"/> formed into a wild beast by his sad
                        experiences with the world. I brought him to my house with some difficulty.
                        The animal had by this time cost me, including damages, board bills,
                        gratuities, transportation, and minor items, some five hundred dollars, and
                        now the question came up what to do with him. We kept him for a while in our
                        back yard, but the small square grass plot behind the city house did not
                        afford scope for his activities. He became friendly with Rosa, the cook, and
                        very playful with her. He would put his paws against her shoulders while she
                        was hanging out the clothes, and roll her over, until she threatened to
                        leave. Moreover, it was not safe for any visitor to put his head out of the
                        back door. Drapeau was always alert. Somehow the dog was not &quot;in
                        harmony with his environment,&quot; and after a few months I earnestly
                        wanted to sell him. I advertised, &quot;A Genuine St. Bernard Dog,
                        Bought at the Hospice,&quot; saying all the sweet things about him that
                        I could, but no answers came to my advertisements.</p>
                    <p>Finally, on Broadway, I saw at the side of a stairway leading down to a
                        basement <pb n="60" id="VAA3906-065"/> a stuffed black-and-tan terrier, with
                        one eye out. This indicated, as I thought, a dealer in dogs; so I went down
                        and interviewed him. Terms were agreed upon; he would keep the dog until
                        sold, and would sell him on commission. Drapeau remained a week or two there
                        without result, until the dealer said we would have to take fifty dollars
                        for him. Meantime I heard of a gentleman who offered seventy- five. I went
                        down to get my dog, offering the dealer his commission, but the man refused
                        to let him go, declaring the dog should not be removed from the shop until I
                        had paid twenty-five dollars. I expostulated in vain. Finally I offered a
                        compromise, but the man was inflexible. He was in possession and was master
                        of the situation. I did not mean to be swindled in so shameless a fashion,
                        so I went to the Marine Court and sued out a writ of replevin. It was placed
                        in the hands of marshal Murphy, a mild little man, to be served. We went up
                        to the dealer&apos;s, the marshal showed the paper, and demanded the
                        gog.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said the dealer, &quot;there he is-take
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Drapeau stood tied to a large crate at one <pb n="61" id="VAA3906-066"/> side
                        of the basement, while a variety of smaller dogs game-cocks, and other
                        animals were in coops and cages around the room, or tied to the wall. The
                        officer approached Drapeau. &quot;Here, doggy, doggy,&quot; said he,
                        in his gentlest and most persuasive manner. Drapeau gave a deep growl and
                        the officer stopped.</p>
                    <p>&quot; Will he bite?&quot; asked the marshal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to have seen him drag that crate after him trying to get
                        at a man yesterday,&quot; remarked the dealer.</p>
                    <p>The marshal stood aghast-the arm of the law was powerless! I was sitting on a
                        chest in the middle of the room, watching the performance, when the dealer
                        quietly said to me:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mebbe you&apos;d like to see what you are settin&apos; on
                        ?&quot;</p>
                    <p>I made no objection, and he lifted the lid of the chest and out from a bed of
                        cotton at the bottom of it came the heads of two great anacondas! It seemed
                        to be a supply store for menageries and circuses. I sought the other side of
                        the room. In the meantime Murphy had disappeared. By the the time I had
                        followed him into the street to recall him, he was wholly<pb n="62"
                            id="VAA3906-067"/> invisible-I do not know how many squares away.</p>
                    <p>I went back to the basement, and then and there the dealer and I made a
                        bargain, with the anacondas between us-he was trying to stuff them back into
                        the chest. He agreed to send Drapeau to the new owner for the sum of fifteen
                        dollars, to be then and there paid. The cash was counted out and the dog
                        sent, from which moment he disappears from history.</p>

                    <head rend="center">ON MEXICAN MOUNTAINS</head>
                    <p>ALTHOUGH Popocatapetl and Orizaba are higher than Mont Blanc, the Cordilleras
                        of Mexico, as a whole, are by no means so picturesque as the Alps. The
                        mountains are not so steep, and they rise with more regularity. A great
                        elevation is attained only by a few isolated peaks. The ranges are not more
                        than ten or twelve thousand feet high. In this tropical climate there is
                        little snow. There are practically no glaciers. Ixtaccihuatl and
                        Popocatapetl do not look so high as the Weisshorn or the Jungfrau, because
                        the starting-point, the plateau from which they rise, is itself eight
                        thousand feet above the sea. Even Orizaba, which, on its eastern slope,
                        descends to the Tierra Caliente, is by no means so impressive as many of the
                        Alps, for the rise is so gradual, the summit is so distant from the lowland,
                            <pb n="64" id="VAA3906-069"/> and the cap of snow at the top is so small
                        that its great height can not be appreciated from any single point.</p>
                    <p>The climb up the cone of a volcano is by no means so difficult as the
                        scramble among the tumbled masses of the Alps. The rope and ladder are
                        unnecessary. There are no crevasses. Gorges and precipices are rare, and it
                        is seldom that even an ice-axe is required. On the other hand, there is need
                        for much endurance. Good lungs and a sound heart are necessary, for it is
                        not an easy thing to toil up a steep incline of lava dust at a great
                        elevation. The &quot;mountain sickness,&quot; with its nausea,
                        headache, dizziness, and lethargy, is very common. One of my companions
                        instantly dropped asleep when he reached the ridge of the crater of
                        Popocatapetl.</p>
                    <p>Before climbing any of the great volcanoes, it seemed wise to have a little
                        preliminary practice among the lesser peaks, and Ajusco, the highest of the
                        summits in the great mountain wall on the west of the valley of Mexico, was
                        selected for the first attempt. It is nearly fourteen thousand feet high.
                        The way is by rail up to the station of Ajusco, thence on horseback <pb
                            n="65" id="VAA3906-070"/> to a point perhaps two thousand feet below the
                        summit, then on foot to the top. The superintendent of the Cuernavaca
                        Railroad kindly made arrangements for our expedition. We left Mexico early
                        in the morning, arriving at Ajusco station about ten o&apos;clock. There
                        was no train back in the afternoon, but a &quot; push car&quot; was
                        provided for us, and on this the roadmaster would take us down to the valley
                        after we had made the ascent. There was no lodging place at Ajusco, but a
                        box car had been placed upon the siding in which we could swing our
                        hammocks, should we be belated and compelled to remain at the station all
                        night. Horses were in readiness for the ascent, as well as <foreign rend="i"
                            >mozo</foreign>, or Indian boy, to show us the way up.</p>
                    <p>Fried eggs and beef, and black beans and coffee were served in the
                        agent&apos;s tent before our start. The <foreign rend="i">mozo</foreign>
                        bought sardines and bread for the journey at an Indian village nearby, and
                        we began the ascent. The mountain looked hardly a rifle-shot from the
                        station, yet it was a good four hours&apos; climb, first up a gentle
                        slope for several miles to the foot of the peak, then by steep zig-zags
                        through the <pb n="66" id="VAA3906-071"/> forest. It was about 12:30 when
                        the boy told us, just at the edge of the timber line, that &quot;this is
                        as far as the horses can go,&quot; and, indeed, we thought it was quite
                        as far as they ought to go; but he added, very unexpectedly, that he would
                        stay with the animals to take care of them, and he pointed out to us the
                        direction to the top, which he said was not quite two hours away, but which
                        was wholly invisible. We suggested that he go with us, but he answered,
                        &quot;Somebody may come and take the horses.&quot; He was immovable,
                        so we set out alone. There was no path. At first the way was very steep,
                        over volcanic rocks, partly bare and partly patched with grass, at an angle
                        of nearly forty-five degrees; but there was good foothold everywhere. At
                        last we could see the cairn and cross that mark the summit. The weather had
                        been warm, so there was no snow, though two days later the mountain was clad
                        in white half-way down. In point of fact, it did not take us an hour to
                        reach the top from the place where the climb began. The view from the summit
                        is very fine. On one side is the valley of Mexico, with its <pb n="67"
                            id="VAA3906-072"/> two great volcanoes, Popocatapetl and Ixtaccihuatl,
                        standing at the entrance like two huge sentinels clad in white mantles of
                        snow. On the other side many mountain ranges rise, one behind the other,
                        toward the Pacific. There is much more verdure on the western side and the
                        air is clearer, for over the great plateau there is a light brown haze,
                        which comes, they say, from the dust of the valley, and rises so high that
                        only the great snow peaks lift their heads above it. At several places there
                        were slender, cloudy pillars of dust, raised by little whirlwinds moving
                        slowly across the plain. Some of these were two or three thousand feet high.
                        These cyclones are not dangerous, but it is most disagreeable to be caught
                        in one of them. Elsewhere the dust cloud was thin enough and we could see
                        long distances. At various points below us rose little ant hills (for so
                        they seemed), small volcanic cones that besprinkle the valley, extinct now,
                        but lively enough, no doubt, in times gone by.</p>
                    <p>We stayed perhaps half an hour at the summit of Ajusco. The wind was cold,
                        but we had little difficulty in breathine.</p>
                    <pb n="68" id="VAA3906-073"/>
                    <p>We descended rapidly and reached the station at 5:30 in time to take the
                        &quot;push car.&quot; This was hauled upon the track; we took our
                        places upon a comfortable spring seat in front and started down hill. The
                        grade was two and a half feet to the hundred, the track was smooth and well
                        ballasted, and we were soon going like the wind, skirting the east side of
                        the western wall of the great plain of Mexico, with the big snow volcanoes,
                        the lakes, the towns, the ant hills, all before us--a toboggan slide of
                        thirty miles, and with no long walk up hill. Part of the way we went at the
                        rate of twenty- five miles an hour, around curves and down long inclines,
                        and at seven o&apos;clock our guide, the roadmaster, deposited us safely
                        upon a tram-car bound for the City of Mexico.</p>
                    <p>Toluca was the next mountain to be ascended, but the trouble was that nobody
                        knew anything about it. The guide-book said it was fifteen thousand feet
                        high, and surely it must be somewhere near the city of the same name. I went
                        to the American Consul-General, but could learn nothing. Finally, I found a
                        man who said there was <pb n="68" id="VAA3906-074"/> a Baptist missionary in
                        the city of Toluca who could tell us. So we took the train for that city.
                        When we arrived there we found that Mr. Powell, the missionary to whom we
                        had been directed, was absent in Mexico, and manifold were the accounts
                        given by hotel keepers, cab drivers, and others, of the proper way to climb
                        the mountain. Some said it would take two days, others said three, some said
                        you could go on horseback, others that you must go on foot. None of them had
                        ever tried it. And there was that great white beauty at their very doors,
                        tempting them to come and stand upon its summit and see spread before them
                        the glories of the earth! How men could spend their lives in the presence of
                        such a mountain and not try to climb it is hard to understand.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Powell returned to Toluca in the evening and called upon us at our hotel.
                        We had gone to bed, but asked him in and had a lively talk in the dark. He
                        had been up the mountain several times. You could go to the crater on
                        horseback through a gap at the side; after that it was a scramble to the
                        summit. The first thing was to ride about fourteen miles across the valley
                            <pb n="70" id="VAA3906-075"/> to Protean Papers to the village of
                        Calimaya, at the foot of the mountain. So, next day, we secured a vehicle
                        with three mules and a horse, with an Indian boy to drive and another to go
                        along and help yell and jump down every little while and lash the leaders
                        into a fine gallop. The vehicle was a cross between a barouche and a
                        buckboard, accommodating itself to the double requirements of great splendor
                        and rough Mexican roads. We had been recommended by Mr. Powell to provide
                        ourselves with plenty of arms and ammunition; so we bought another revolver,
                        he loaned us his carbine, and we became travelling arsenal. There had been
                        rain the night before, with much snow on the volcano, and the clouds hung
                        far down its sides. The air was cool and fresh, and the drive was
                        exhilarating up the valley of Toluca, with ranges of mountains on each side,
                        and the huge volcano slowly unwinding itself from its cloudy garments till
                        it stood out white and clear before us. The boys in front kept up a
                        continuous shouting, &quot;Mulasl Caramba! Hi, hi!&quot; and much
                        besides that is untranslatable. We reached Calimaya just as twilight fell.
                        It was a low-roofed village <pb n="71" id="VAA3906-076"/> built along a
                        straight climbing street, with a big church and high-walled convent yard,
                        and just opposite to these the &quot;Palacio Municipal.&quot; The
                        boys drove to a large stable, where they unhitched the mules, and then
                        conducted us to a little <foreign rend="i">fonda</foreign>, or restaurant,
                        on the opposite side of the street. The proprietor was very drunk and
                        talked, in a thick voice, Spanish that I could not understand, but while
                        supper was preparing he went out with us to hunt Pablo Mendoza, who was to
                        be our guide. Pablo was doubtful. The snow had been heavy. We could never
                        gain the summit. Perhaps we could reach the crater. We must have two
                            <foreign rend="i">mozos</foreign> to help, and six mules for the party.
                        We told him to go ahead. Our intoxicated host was to pro- vide chickens,
                        sausages, bread, and hard-boiled eggs. After supper in the dingy little
                            <foreign rend="i">fonda</foreign>, we sought our night quarters. A room
                        had been provided for us at the doctor&apos;s, opposite, --a room filled
                        with surgical apparatus and medical library, but now two beds were
                        introduced; one was made up on the floor, and for the other there was an
                        iron bedstead. We retired early. A little after ten a voice was heard at a
                            <pb n="72" id="VAA3906-077"/> small aperture in the shutters near my
                        bed. It was the voice of Pablo Mendoza: &quot;Pepe, Pepe, tell the
                        Senores I shall not wake them at 3:30 in the morning, as I promised. It is
                        useless. The snow is too deep. The mountain cannot be ascended.&quot; I
                        arose and had a colloquy with Pablo through the small hole in the shutter.
                        He refused to try it. There was nothing to do but acquiesce, so we turned
                        back to our beds. But on Tuesday, said Pablo Mendoza, the snow would surely
                        be melted. We would try again next Tuesday. So we rattled back to Toluca,
                        the two boys yelling, and the men and women and donkeys that thronged the
                        road with their picturesque costumes and burdens of food, and crockery, and
                        hay, all scattered to right and left as they heard us. In the afternoon we
                        returned to Mexico.</p>
                    <p>Mexicans have strange ways of doing business. I was to telegraph to Pablo
                        Mendoza on Tuesday, before starting from the capital, and he was to answer
                        whether the day was suitable for the climb. If so, we would leave on the
                        two-o&apos;clock train. Sent the message at eight o&apos;clock in
                        the morning, as soon as the telegraph office <pb n="73" id="VAA3906-078"/>
                        opened. We waited six hours for an answer, but none came. Finally we started
                        on the afternoon train from Mexico, taking our chances upon being able to
                        make the ascent. A four-horse vehicle met us atthe station at Toluca and
                        drove us to Calimaya by moonlight. We reached the village about eight
                        o&apos;clock. We hunted up Pablo Mendoza and learned from him that he
                        had received the telegram at 11:30 and that he answered it immediately,
                        telling us not to come for three days yet, since the snow was still deep
                        upon the mountain. We learned afterwards that this telegram had been
                        delivered at our hotel in Mexico at five P.M. Such is the telegraphic
                        service conducted by the Mexican Federal Government. But now that we were at
                        Calimaya, we refused to &quot;wait another day,&quot; as Pablo
                        suggested, or to return, so he finally said, <foreign rend="i">vamos a
                            ver</foreign> and that he would try to procure the horses, mules, and
                        men. There were three of us. Three horses, three <foreign rend="i"
                            >mozos</foreign>, and six mules were secured, and Pablo was to waken us
                        in the morning at half past three. We slept in two comfortable little rooms
                        behind the <foreign rend="i">tienda</foreign> the principal village store at
                        Calimaya. At a <pb n="74" id="VAA3906-079"/> quarter past four we awakened
                        ourselves. We called up the boy at the <foreign rend="i">tienda</foreign>
                        who let us out. All was silent in the streets of the village. We asked the
                        boy to conduct us to Pablo Mendoza&apos;s house so that we might arouse
                        our guide. He refused. If he left the <foreign rend="i">tienda</foreign>
                        there would be no one to shut the door behind him. Then we went to the
                            <foreign rend="i">fonda</foreign> where they had promised to have our
                        chocolate and eggs ready, as well as a basket of provisions for the journey.
                        All was silent. We thumped and yelled loudly enough to awaken the dead.
                        Finally a young man who slept in the entrance room on the floor got up,
                        roused the women, and then went to bed again. We entered and they made ready
                        our chocolate. Again we asked to be conducted to the home of Pablo Mendoza,
                        but there was no one to go with us. A small boy was there. Could he not go
                        with us? &quot;He was too little,&quot; said his mother. Then there
                        was girl, a few years older. Could she go? &quot;She was
                        afraid.&quot; Perhaps the young man in bed upon the floor would go.
                        &quot;No, he was asleep.&quot; Perhaps the good woman herself would
                        go with us. &quot; No, she must <pb n="75" id="VAA3906-080"/> prepare
                        the breakfast.&quot; So we started out alone and shouted through the
                        silent streets, &quot;Pablo Mendoza! Pablo Mendoza!&quot; but in
                        vain. Finally we saw aman. We followed him. He got away. Then another, but
                        he did not know where Pablo lived. Then, after an hour or so, we espied two
                        others. Would they show us? Yes, if we gave them a <foreign rend="i"
                            >peseta</foreign>. Very well, we would give it. &quot;But give it to
                        us now.&quot; We did so, and just around the corner they brought us to
                        Pablo, who had collected two horses and a man, the first installment of our
                        convoy. We started from the village at six o&apos;clock, just two hours
                        late, two precious hours when the climb fills the whole day. We expostulated
                        with Pablo, but he took it as a matter of course and merely said that we had
                        started quite soon enough.</p>
                    <p>Our way wound, at first, up through fields of maguey and corn, past the small
                        hamlet of Saragossa, then we entered a magnificent forest of tall pines
                        quite clear of underbrush, with openings and fine views of the broad valley
                        and distant mountains behind us, and before us the white-capped volcano. We
                        stopped at the but <pb n="76" id="VAA3906-081"/> of a <foreign rend="i"
                            >vagueria</foreign>, or cow pasture, for fresh milk. Soon the snow
                        began, far down in the forest, but it was not deep, nor did it become so
                        till we emerged into the open land above. Then there were patches where
                        horses and mules floundered, and we had to dismount and walk. Once mule
                        loaded with blankets, provisions, and &quot;traps&quot; fell, rolled
                        over half a dozen times down the slope of the mountain, then rose and walked
                        on as if nothing had happened. Thus we climbed the ridge that surrounds the
                        crater and then, descending, we halted and took our lunch in the snow, by
                        the side of a small lake within. The meal was a good one. The chickens had
                        been brought in alive to the <foreign rend="i">fonda</foreign>, for our
                        approval, the evening before. The sausage had plenty of garlic in it, but
                        was not unpalatable to a properly disciplined stomach, and the coffee was
                        strong, though cold. There was another larger lake within the crater, said
                        to be nearly two miles in circumference. It was a little higher up, and my
                        two companions started out to visit it and to climb a hill which rose in the
                        midst of this great amphitheatre of crags. They were both faster walkers
                        than I, and I de- <pb n="77" id="VAA3906-082"/> cided to climb slowly to the
                        summit of what the guides said was the highest peak, and await their coming
                        later in the afternoon. One of the guides went with me, and two others with
                        my companions. I crossed a stretch of snow and then mounted one of the
                        horses and was carried up steep slopes of lava dust and ashes till the poor
                        animal gave out. Then another pull on foot over a snow slope, and, finally,
                        a slow, careful climb over a ridge of rocks to the summit. It was a warm
                        pull up the slope, but a cold wind met us at the top of the ridge, and an
                        overcoat and a stiff pull at the bottle of <foreign rend="i"
                            >taquila</foreign> (the strongest Mexican fire-water) were both
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>The view from the summit was fine, but it was much softer in character than
                        any from the high peaks of the Alps. The ridges of the Sierra Madre
                        stretched out below us. The two great volcanoes, Popocatapetl and
                        Ixtaccihuatl, were visible in the dim distance, and it is said that on a
                        very clear day you can see the two oceans from this place. Looking at the
                        ther peaks that immediately surrounded the crater of Toluca, I saw two which
                        seemed to me to be a few hundred feet higher than that which I <pb n="78"
                            id="VAA3906-083"/> had scaled. I spoke of this to the guide, who had
                        assured me that the one I climbed was the highest of all. His only answer
                        was, &quot;Well, perhaps they maybe.&quot; Such is the mountain
                        guide in Mexico.</p>
                    <p>I supposed the others would join me on the summit, but the thin air of this
                        great altitude had wearied them and they were resting near the lake
                        below.</p>
                    <p>There are many curious things about this crater. Mr. Powell, the missionary
                        at Toluca, told me there was an Indian altar here with painted
                        hieroglyphics. I asked the guides to show it to me, but they knew nothing of
                        it. On the way up the peak I saw a stone which seemed to me to have upon it
                        a bas-relief of the plumage of an Indian warrior. The feathers were quite
                        regular on each side, with a head band below. This might, of course, be a
                        mere natural freak, but it looked to me like a rather fine piece of
                        sculpture, broken only at one corner. It was too heavy to carry, and I had
                        to leave it.</p>
                    <p>We rode rapidly down to Calimaya, and when we reached it, at five in the
                        afternoon, our wagon was in readiness.</p>
                    <p>A ride of an hour and a half brought us <pb n="79" id="VAA3906-084"/> back to
                        the city of Toluca. By some strange oversight I had neglected to procure
                        smoked glasses for the snow climb. The glare had been dealing, and all night
                        long I lay awake with a sharp pain in the eyes. At one time it was almost
                        impossible to open or close my eyelids, but before daylight the inflammation
                        had ceased. In addition to this eye trouble, the climber of Toluca is sure
                        to get plenty of &quot;local color&quot; upon his nose and cheeks,
                        that bright, shiny red, peculiar to the mountaineer, which renders shaving a
                        most painful operation, and makes those who meet you stare at you as if you
                        were a candidate for the Keeley treatment.</p>
                    <p>The conductor on the local train to Mexico was one Drake, from Mississippi.
                        He offered us cigars and St. Louis papers, talked politics, and advocated
                        the spoils system. He had just recovered from an illness. What was it? He
                        had been shot by the agent at one of the stations, a Mexican, who had called
                        him a vile name, which he had resented by knocking the fellow down. Had the
                        man been punished for shooting him? &quot;Well, no; he died.&quot;
                        &quot;How did he die?&quot; &quot;From the blow I gave him when
                        I knocked him down.&quot; &quot;Well, <pb n="80" id="VAA3906-085"/>
                        didn&apos;t they do anything to you for killing him&quot;
                        &quot;No, they ould n&apos;t.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot;
                        &quot; Well, they fined me five dollars for hitting him, and then when
                        he died I had been punished once, and they could n&apos;t punish me
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Before coming to Mexico we had been told that it would be a hard thing to
                        find a good hotel outside of the capital. On the contrary, we found it much
                        harder to get a good meal or a good room in the City of Mexico than at many
                        other places. When I went to Ameca-Mea preparatory to climbing Popocatapetl,
                        I supposed that at this small town I should find nothing fit to eat, so I
                        determined to start well fed at the restaurant of the Interoceanic Raiload
                        Company, in the City of Mexico, before the train left. &quot; What have
                        you?&quot; I asked. &quot;Nothing,&quot; was the answer. It was
                        two o&apos;clock in the afternoon and I had had nothing to eat since the
                        morning coffee. &quot;Give me a cup of chocolate and a roll, or an egg
                        and a glass of milk.&quot; <foreign rend="i">&quot;Hay
                            nada&quot;</foreign> --there is nothing! So Ileft with an empty
                        stomach and satisfied myself with tortillas and glasses of pulque at the
                        stations on the wav. But when I reached Ameca-Mea I <pb n="81"
                            id="VAA3906-086"/> found a clean, cozy little hotel, where they gave me
                        a dinner of six courses, all excellent, served by Conchita, a soft-voiced
                        Indian maiden of twelve years, who did her duty in a manner worthy of the
                        most experienced <foreign rend="i">garcon</foreign>. The proprietor was a
                        Spaniard, a Gallego. His sideboard was rich, decorated with fine china and
                        the best glass, and his cellar was stocked with good wine. There was a huge
                        bath-room, with carved oak and velvet armchairs; there was a big front hall,
                        where hams hung suspended by long poles from the ceiling, and in the hall a
                        spiral staircase which led to a clean bedroom in a big dormer on the roof,
                        where I slept between the whitest of sheets, with a tall canopy over me, a
                        picture of the Redeemer just above my head, and a &quot;Virgin of
                        Guadalupe&quot; on the opposite wall, who turned her soft eyes upon me
                        as I woke in the morning. It was an ideal inn for a small country town.</p>
                    <p>I made arrangements for three horses, three guides, a mule for the luggage,
                        an <foreign rend="i">arriero</foreign>, or mule driver, and a <foreign
                            rend="i">mozo</foreign> to help generally. My two companions were to
                        join me the following morning, when we would start together for the <foreign
                            rend="i">rancho</foreign> of <pb n="82" id="VAA3906-087"/>General Ochoa,
                        the owner of Popocatapetl, from whom we had obtained the necessary
                        permission to climb the mountain. Then, in company with two Mexican boys,
                        who had never left my sight for an instant since they took my hand luggage
                        from the train, I climbed the Sacromonte, a high hill back of the village,
                        from the summit of which is to be seen a glorious panorama of the two great
                        volcanoes of the Mexican plateaus-Popocatapetl, &quot;the mountain that
                        pours forth fire,&quot; and Ixtaccihuatl, &quot;the white
                        woman.&quot; The sky was cloudless. The evening lights were magnificent,
                        and it was like gazing on the Mont Blanc range from the Flegere. The lines
                        were softer, however, and although the two great peaks were really higher
                        than any among the Alps, yet they had no companions, there were no great
                        glaciers surrounding them, and the elevation of the valley, some eight
                        thousand feet, reduced their apparent height.</p>
                    <p>On the following morning, just before our start for Popocatapetl, the guides
                        inspected our outfit, our overcoats, blankets, sombreros, leggings, gloves,
                        goggles, ice-axe, etc., and declared all complete except our hobnailed
                        shoes. These they said <pb n="83" id="VAA3906-088"/> would never do. The
                        snow was too hard. We must buy some sort of foot-gear with an unheard-of
                        name. We did not know what it was, but told the guides to fetch us three
                        pairs. They brought back a huge piece of flexible leather and some leather
                        thongs. Out of this they would make us the sort of sandals they wore
                        themselves. We were to wrap our feet up in cloths and fasten on the leather
                        with the thongs. At this point we rebelled. Our hobnails were good enough
                        for the snows and ice of Switzerland; why not for those of Mexico? Was it a
                        different kind of snow? We would wear no such bandages as they brought us.
                        Those would do better for the gout than for Popocatapetl. The guides said:
                        &quot;Doubtless the <foreign>senores</foreign> knew best, but they must
                        take the risk.&quot; So we took the risk.</p>
                    <p>We started from Ameca-Mea about half past eleven. It was a ride of six hours
                        to the <foreign rend="i">rancho</foreign> of General Ochoa, where we were to
                        pass the night. Our path lay at first across the valley, which is fertile
                        and very green for the tableland of Mexico, where the prevailing color is a
                        dusty gray. There was dust enough on our road, how- <pb n="84"
                            id="VAA3906-089"/> ever, thrown up by our own horses and by the vast
                        number of donkeys and mules that we met coming down the mountains with loads
                        that it was often hard to get far enough to right or left on the road to
                        keep out of their way. Soon the bridle path began to climb the foothills,
                        and then it wound up the higher ridge which separates the two great
                        volcanoes. This ridge must be twelve thousand feet high, at least four
                        thousand feet above the plain of Ameca on one side and that of Puebla and
                        Cholula on the other. Here, however, was the great highroad to Mexico in
                        Montezuma&apos;s time, over which thae army of Cortez passed, which much
                        difficulty and suffering, in its first march to the capital. Near the top of
                        the ridge we found the Indian woodcutters who had supplied the donkeys with
                        their loads. These men had erected for themselves little thatched cabins of
                        long grass, just large enough to crawl into for shelter from the frosty air
                        of the nihgt. A little over the top of the ridge, and on its eastern side,
                        was the <foreign rend="i">rancho</foreign>. It was a rude shed with a few
                        stones in the middle for a fire, and a hole in the corner of the <pb n="85"
                            id="VAA3906-090"/> roof to let the smoke out. Planks were laid upon an
                        incline a foot or two above the floor on one side of this shed, and upon
                        these hay was scattered in rather scanty quantities. This was the common bed
                        of guides and travellers. Another shed, still more primitive, gave shelter
                        to our horses. A third was used in the preparation of sulphur, which is
                        found in the crater of the mountain, and extracted with immense labor. There
                        had been very few fine views on the way up, but near the top of the ridge
                        the immense volcano just in front of us seemed ready to crush us under its
                        vast weight of snow. The clouds which had been hanging over it for most of
                        the afternoon lifted about sunset, and the full moon, which rose when
                        daylight vanished, lit it with a very pale light till it seemed like a huge
                        but beautiful spectre.</p>
                    <p>The guides brought in branches of trees and kindled a fire in the hut, by the
                        light of which we consumed a part of the liberal basketfuls of food provided
                        for us at the inn at Ameca-Mea.</p>
                    <p>We had heard the most contradictory accounts of the time necessary to climb
                        the mountain. A guide in Mexico had told us <pb n="86" id="VAA3906-091"/>
                        seven hours; the man from whom we had hired the horses said four hours; the
                        guides themselves thought about six hours. We determined to be on the safe
                        side, and told them to call us at two o&apos;clock for the start. The
                        moonlight would guide us sufficiently, and since we had to make the descent
                        an then return to Ameca-Mea before dark, it was best to start early. But the
                        guides said no. Half past three or four o&apos;clock would be early
                        enough. There was no use in rising before that. At last we tried to
                        compromise on three o&apos;clock and they assented, but one of us heard
                        them say among themselves that they did not propose to waken us till four.
                        The remedy, however, was easy. There was no sleeping on that wretched hay,
                        especially after the fire had gone out and the cold wind began to chill our
                        legs and feet in spite of our blankets. If the guides would not waken us we
                        would waken them. Indeed, we had very little confidence in being wakened at
                        all. According to our best experience a Mexican never wakens anybody. When
                        two o&apos;clock came we were glad enough to tumble out of the hay,
                        light a fagot, start the fire, and raise a commo- <pb n="87"
                            id="VAA3906-092"/> tion among the guides. The sleepy fellows would have
                        snored throu but I offered to each of them a good glass of <foreign rend="i"
                            >taquila</foreign>, and their eyes opened. We warmed a bottle of coffee,
                        ate some eggs, and dissected two chickens in aboriginal fashion. Before
                        three o&apos;clock the horses were saddled and we were on our way. The
                        moonlight made the path almost as plain as day, even where it was nothing
                        but a narrow trail down the side of a small gorge and up again beyond. Then
                        the poor animals struggled over vast inclines of lava dust, in which they
                        sank to their knees, and they panted in the thin air so pitifully that we
                        had to let them rest every few minutes. At last we reached a straggling
                        collection of rocks which our guides said was the end of the horse trail,
                        and thenceforth we had to try the lava dust ourselves.</p>
                    <p>The climbing was abominable. For every step forward we slipped back nearly as
                        far, but we flattered ourselves that when we reached the snow line it would
                        be better. In fact, however, it became worse, for at this time of the year
                        there was no smooth snow spread over the mountainside, but small
                        wedge-shaped blocks of dirty ice, all <pb n="88" id="VAA3906-093"/> leaning
                        in one direction (eastward), and it looked for all the world like a vast
                        graveyard with the stones tilted over. The average height of these blocks
                        was about four feet, and we had to straddle them and cut off the ridges with
                        the ice-axe whenever they were too high, or cut steps in their sides.
                        Occasionally there would be little narrow pathways between them for short
                        distances, but this was over the loose lava dust, which slipped back as we
                        climbed it. The ascent was steep, nearly forty-five degrees in many places,
                        but there was always a fair foothold, not the slightest danger, no
                        rock-climbing nor steep snow slopes; it was simply slow, tedious, and very
                        wearisome, and as the air became thinner the exertion required was very
                        great, and the rests for breath and renewed energy became more frequent and
                        longer. Our hobnailed shoes served us better than the bandages in which the
                        guides had swathed their feet; we slipped less than they. The guides were
                        most unsatisfactory. At first they went ahead, all three of them, leaving us
                        to climb alone as best we might. After a while we insisted that one of them
                        should accompany each of us. <pb n="89" id="VAA3906-094"/> My companions,
                        younger and more agile than I, soon distanced me, and it was nearly six
                        hours after leaving our horses that I finally surmounted the narrow ridge
                        which surrounds the crater of Popocatapeti. During the last hour it was
                        impossible to take more than six or seven steps without resting. At the
                        final ridge a grand scene presented itself--a great circular chasm, more
                        than a thousand feet deep, with wild, rugged rocks on every side, and, at
                        several places below, great clouds of sulphur smoke steaming up, which
                        impregnated the air with its odor and made us realize that this crater was
                        indeed one of the gates of our terrestrial Hades.</p>
                    <p>The exterior view was by no means so impressive. Popocatapeti is so high
                        above the plain and above all the surrounding mountains (except
                        Ixtaccihuatl, just opposite) that everything looked dwarfed and dimmed by
                        the immense distance. Clouds had drifted around the mountain during our
                        ascent, and at several times had threatened to envelop us, but they had all
                        floated away, and the sky was entirely clear while we were at the summit.
                        Below us stretched the great valleys of Puebla and Mexico. <pb n="90"
                            id="VAA3906-095"/>There was a faint brown mist over all the landscape.
                        The peaks of Orizaba, Malinche, and Ixtaccihuatl rose above it, sharp and
                        clear against the sky. We could see from fifty to seventy-five miles in all
                        directions, but at this dusty time of the year the valleys looked like
                        unsubstantial clouds. The peaks alone were the realities. Ixtaccihuatl was
                        the nearest. It is a magnificent mountain, much more beautiful from the
                        plain than Popocatapetl itself; but it is long and narrow, and only the end
                        is visible from the higher peak--not the broad side which you see from
                        Ameca-Mea or Puebla. The view was certainly impressive, but not so fine as
                        that which had been spread before us from Toluca. Popocatapetl, although
                        over seventeen thousand feet high, seems rather like a huge hill than a
                        great mountain. It is so regular on every side that the rugged face of the
                        crater is all that impresses one with its Alpine proportions.</p>
                    <p>We skirted the edge of this vast chasm for some distance, and then,
                        returning, began the descent. At some seasons of the year travellers can
                        slide down the slope on petatas, or strips of matting. But this was not
                        possible now, and we picked our way <pb n="91" id="VAA3906-096"/> through
                        the icy tombstones back to the slopes of lava dust, and then, half walking,
                        half sliding, down these slopes, we reached the rock and the cross, where
                        the horses came to meet us and take us back to the shed where we had passed
                        the night. A little refreshment at the hut and then five hours more on
                        horseback to the town. Ameca-Meca is visible from the crest of the ridge and
                        seems quite near, but hour after hour of dusty travel passes before you
                        reach it. An excellent supper awaited us, however, on our arrival at seven
                        o&apos;clock, a little after dark, then a deep sleep in the soft beds of
                        the Spanish inn, and at 6:30 in the morning we were on our way to the City
                        of Mexico.</p>

                    <head rend="center">SOME OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING<lb/> GOETHE</head>
                    <p>IT interesting to read the conflicting estimates of Goethe made by his
                        contemporaries. In Germany he held a dictatorship in literature more
                        absolute than that of any other author anywhere. Only a short time before,
                        Voltaire had exercised a literary sovereignty of a like character over the
                        entire continent, and Doctor Johnson, full of insular prejudices, had
                        dominated, in much the same fashion, the literary thought of Great Britain.
                        But neither of these men made a profound and lasting impression upon
                        literature. They had both been great men of their time, but the admirers of
                        Goethe judged rightly when they considered that his genius was not
                        transitory but permanent, not local but universal, belonging to every race
                        and every speech into which his thought could be translated. But if during
                            <pb n="93" id="VAA3906-098"/>his lifetime his own country was
                        enthusiastic, his reputation abroad was of slow growth. When <hi rend="i"
                            >Goet. von Berlichingen</hi> appeared, the French <foreign rend="i"
                            >litteratuers</foreign> and the French king himself considered it a base
                        imitation of all that was worst in the English drama. De Quincey, while
                        acknowledging the merits of Goethe, devoted most of his celebrated essay on
                        the German poet to a refutation of &quot;the extravagant claims of his
                        admirers,&quot; and insisted that the foundations of Goethe&apos;s
                        reputation were (1) his great age and literary fecundity, (2) his official
                        rank, and (3) the enigmatical character of much that he wrote. Goethe, said
                        De Quincey, had mistaken his calling. He ought to have confined himself to
                        pastoral poetry, of which <hi rend="i">Herman und Dorothea</hi> was so
                        admirable a specimen. His reputation would surely decline.</p>
                    <p>In the essay concerning <hi rend="i">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, De Quincey
                        criticises mercilessly, and sometimes with great justice, the behavior of
                        the characters in the novel. Other critic have observed that no gentleman
                        could have written <hi rend="i">Wilhelm Meister</hi>. The answer of
                        Goethe&apos;s friends is perhaps sufficient, that it was written. not so
                        much by a <pb n="94" id="VAA3906-099"/>
                        <hi rend="i">gentleman</hi>, as by a <hi rend="i">man</hi>; that the
                        faithfulness of the portrait was the predominating principle. In fact, the
                        keynote of all Goethe&apos;s writing is truth embodied in poetic
                        form.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps no man who ever lived was a more complete type of humanity than
                        Goethe. Its reason, its passions, its strength, its weakness, its beauty,
                        its deformities- he embodied them all. I know of no picture which more
                        completely represents the complete man than the picture of Goethe. I know of
                        no head which represents the fulness of human characteristics so well as
                        Goethe&apos;s head in the statues and models which have come down to us.
                        And it is not only his appearance and characteristics which seem to embody
                        humanity, but his career itself. He had tried all things. His life was as
                        complete as any recorded in history. He lived to a ripe old age, amid
                        favorable surroundings. From his ancestors he acquired the traits which
                        underlay his greatness: something of his father&apos;s sturdiness, but
                        much more of his mother&apos;s serenity and cheerfulness. His education
                        was such as would naturally contribute to the making of a many-sided man. It
                        might be called desultory, but it was cer- <pb n="95" id="VAA3906-100"/>
                        tainly comprehensive. Besides his Latin, Greek, Italian, French, and
                        English, he had a little chemistry and mathematics, a good deal of alchemy,
                        a smattering of theology and law, interspersed with riding, fencing,
                        dancing, drawing, and music. Thus he naturally acquired some knowledge of a
                        great variety of subjects. His life flowed in an unbroken stream of
                        prosperity. Goethe realized, perhaps more than any one else, the old pagan
                        idea of blessedness--a sound mind in sound body.</p>
                    <p>His employment at the court of Carl August of Saxe Weimar was specially
                        favorable to his literary life. The little German dukedoms and
                        principalities, which were in many respects a curse to the land, were in one
                        way an advantage. They formed nuclei of artistic and literary culture. Each
                        of the petty princes became a Maecenas to the poets and artists whom he
                        attracted to his court.</p>
                    <p>There were, it is true, some disadvantages in this. The love of liberty, one
                        of the highest inspirations to poetry, was wanting. Adulation stood in the
                        place of love of country. Goethe has been charged with lack of patriotism,
                        and his service at court was perhaps responsible for this shortcoming. <pb
                            n="96" id="VAA3906-101"/> But such service has also compensating
                        advantages. It is not necessary for the poet to seek merely popular
                        applause. The artist can be truer to his ideals. And thus it was with
                        Goethe. He wrote many things which were not appreciated at the time by the
                        public, and it was by such work that his influence upon the thought of
                        Germany at last became so absolute.</p>
                    <p>His literary productions were as many-sided as his life. He has not done the
                        best work in any one department of literature. In the drama, where he
                        reached the highest point of his literary career, he is inferior to
                        Shakespeare, as a poet he is behind Homer and Dante, as a novelist he is far
                        below Thakeray, as a scientist his place is subordinate, as a philosopher he
                        is often inconsistent and irrational, and yet he showed a catholic spirit, a
                        power to be all things that man is capable of being, which is not found
                        elsewhere in literature or in life. So multiform is his genius that his
                        works would hardly be attributed to one man if it were not known that Goethe
                        was the author. There is <hi rend="i">Goetz von Berlichingen</hi>, strong,
                        rugged, unfinished, an admirable portraiture of character, in which form and
                            <pb n="97" id="VAA3906-102"/> dramatic unity are disregarded; there is
                            <hi rend="i">The Sorrows of Werter</hi>, a masterpiece of the
                        sentimental school, a little morbid, but none the less true to human nature,
                        awakening the sympathy and tears of a generation; there is <hi rend="i"
                            >Iphigenia</hi>, the best reproduction in modern literature of the cold,
                        statuesque, classic drama; there is <hi rend="i">Torquato Tasso</hi>,
                        embodying the intellectual and spiritual struggle of the Renaissance; there
                        is <hi rend="i">Egmont</hi>, a wonderful medley of deep passion and exalted
                        patriotism; there is <hi rend="i">Hermann und Dorothea</hi>, the most
                        perfect pastoral since the time of Theocritus and the <hi rend="i"
                            >Georgics</hi>; there are Goethe&apos;s scientific doctrines, his
                        forecast of the great doctrine of evolution, his theories of color and
                        light, inaccurate perhaps, but still a proof of his many-sidedness; and,
                        finally, there is <hi rend="i">Faust</hi>, the only great dramatic poem of
                        ancient or modern times worthy to rank with the masterpieces of
                        Shakespeare.</p>
                    <p>The secret of much of Goethe&apos;s power was that he drew the sources of
                        his literary work from his own experience--an experience so variegated and
                        indeed universal that it becomes to us, through the medium of his genius,
                        the experience of humanity itself.</p>

                    <head rend="center">ON THE FRAILTIES OF LITERARY<lb/> CRITICISM</head>
                    <p>THE world pays more reverence to criticism than criticism deserves. I think
                        this comes partly from the fact that, oftener than we think, we take men at
                        their own estimate of themselves, and there is in the very fact of censure
                        an implied superiority over the thing censured. As the judge outranks the
                        litigant, so the critic rises in our imagination above the author,
                        especially if he handle the latter without gloves. For it is unfavorable
                        criticism which is most impressive. We know that any fool can applaud, but
                        we think it requires discrimination to find fault. Hence the great
                        reputation acquired by Voltaire&apos;s Pococurante, who disdained Homer,
                        Virgil, Horace, Cicero, Milton, the man of science-every- body, until an
                        enraptured community exclaimed: &quot;What a prodigious genius is <pb
                            n="99" id="VAA3906-104"/> this Pococurante! Nothing can please
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the simplicity of inexperience I, too, used to believe in critics. I did
                        not like to make up my mind on the merits of a book until heard what these
                        gifted creatures had said of it. I was particularly humble in the presence
                        of those who, like one of the editors of Shakespeare, had said that common
                        readers &quot; must perforce either take the results of deep scholarship
                        on trust or else not havethem at all,&quot;-in other words, that we were
                        incapable of forming any just opinions of our own. Scholars of such
                        inaccessible attainments awakened my awe.</p>
                    <p>But now I know them! After a writer has read the reviews of his own works, he
                        is qualified to &quot;swear at the court&quot; with unction, if not
                        with impartiality. Nay, he has even a better remedy than the litigant. For
                        he may constitute himself a court of appeals, review the decisions he does
                        not like, and even convict and pronounce sentence against his accusers.</p>
                    <p>This is possible because of the peculiar constitution of the tribunals by
                        which art and literature are judged.</p>
                    <p>When the Pope dies and the Holy See <pb n="100" id="VAA3906-105"/> becomes
                        vacant, the Spirit descends upon the entire College of Cardinals, or at
                        least upon the &quot;odd man,&quot; in selecting the successor who
                        is to fill it. When a Grand Lama dies, his coadjutor selects from a list of
                        new-born babes three names, and from these the abbots, after a week of
                        prayer, single out by lot the successor of the dead potentate. Thus the
                        Divinity makes known its will and points out the little body in which is to
                        reside the reincarnated soul of wisdom and philosophy.</p>
                    <p>Our method of choosing the arbiters of art and literature is more simple.
                        There is no need for death to leave a vacancy, nor for any convocation to
                        await the illumination of the Spirit. The inspiration is strictly personal.
                        Each candidate, after contemplation of his own transcendent qualifications,
                        selects himself and crowns his own head with the tiara of infallible
                        judgment.</p>
                    <p>And so I here propose to crown myself. Luckily no preliminary training is
                        required. <q type="blockquote">

                    <p>Dean Swift indeed proposes some qualifications. &quot;Sleeping, talking,
                        and laugh- <pb n="101" id="VAA3906-106"/> ing,&quot; he says,
                        &quot;are qualities sufficient to furnish out a critic.&quot; But
                        Swift required too much. Many a critic is a solemn owl to whom laughter is
                        as distant as the stars.</p>
                    <p>Being called therefore, as I know myself to be, to review my reviewers, leap
                        at a bound to a higher pinnacle than the ones they occupy. If the critic of
                        Shakespeare dwells on loftier heights than the great dramatist, how
                        supremely exalted must be the station of him who shall pass upon the merits
                        of criticism itself! I propose to stand on the apex of the pyramid.</p>
                    <p>Come then, ye arbiters of human genius, and let me see of what stuff you are
                        composed. For now am I the pedagogue and <hi rend="i">you</hi> must stand
                        before <hi rend="i">me</hi> while I lay about me with vigor and apply the
                        ferule to every delinquent! And there are delinquents enow, and of many
                        kinds. Let me enumerate. First:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <head>THE INDOLENT CRITIC</head>
                        <l>&quot;O ye chorus of indolent reviewers,</l>
                        <l>Irresponsible, indolent reviewers!&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>Why Tennyson should call you a chorus indeed, I know not, for you speak not
                            <pb n="102" id="VAA3906-107"/> together, and the thing you utter is
                        neither music nor harmony of any kind. Your uproar is more like that of the
                        singing school where, though all sang at once, each uttered the words he
                        knew best and set them to the tune he knew least. You blow all ways, like
                        the winds of Eolus.</p>
                    <p>Once I wrote a romance and submitted it for criticism. One man liked it on
                        account of its evident historical basis; another declared that the
                        historical incidents had crowded out the story. One admired it on account of
                        the directness with which it appealed to the reader; another insisted that
                        the author should not have addressed the reader at all. One admired the
                        simplicity of the style, and another attacked its mannerisms. One spoke of
                        the beauty of the strange legends which were introduced, while another
                        declared that such episodes marred the narrative. One said: &quot;A
                        mystical tone runs through the book that increases the strangeness of the
                        story,&quot; while another found fault with this because it made the
                        story improbable. All of which goes to prove that whatever you say in your
                        story, and however you say it, some men will like it the better on <pb
                            n="103" id="VAA3906-108"/> that account, while others will find fault
                        with it for that particular reason. So whatever an author may do, let him
                        not try to please everybody.</p>
                    <p>But although Tennyson may have gone far afield when he spoke of reviewers as
                        a chorus, he was well within the bounds of truth when he said that they were
                        indolent. Nobody knows this better than the publishers of the books
                        submitted to their judgment.</p>
                    <p>In issuing a revised edition of a short monograph, I was told by my publisher
                        to write a prefatory statement showing why the revision was made,
                        &quot;as a guide for those critics who would not have time to read the
                        book.&quot; The advice was opportune, for find in perhaps a dozen of the
                        clippings before me that the entire review is composed of a transcript of
                        this preface. In a number of cases the words are given verbatim, in others
                        the reviewer seeks (sometimes ineffectually), to give the substance of
                        them.</p>
                    <p>There were critics, it is true, whose ambition was not content with showing
                        that they had read the fourteen lines of this preface. One of these gave
                        evidence <pb n="104" id="VAA3906-109"/> that he had also examined a whole
                        leaf of the text, since his observations concluded with an extract taken
                        from near the bottom of the second page. Others, after copying the preface,
                        would skip to the final paragraph. The first and last sentence both
                        appearing, how should it be known that the reviewer has not read a word of
                        what lay between?</p>
                    <p>One of the reviews of a biography I published some years since clearly shows
                        that the reviewer had read the first nineteen pages of Volume 1. In his
                        epitome of the contents of these pages, the subject of the biography is
                        safely brought into the world, lives with &quot;two old aunts&quot;
                        until he is fifteen years of age, becomes a druggist&apos;s clerk and
                        then a hatter, goes to college, marries, practises law, becomes a country
                        judge, and afterwards attends a law school. The reviewer feels, no doubt,
                        that he ought to give the hero a good start, so my statesman is projected
                        famously into life&apos;s trials and burdens. But this is all! What else
                        becomes of him we know not, except that it appears there were
                        &quot;exciting political episodes in which he took a leading
                        part,&quot; that he <pb n="105" id="VAA3906-110"/> made
                        &quot;important speeches,&quot; and &quot;though unaided in
                        life,&quot; he had a &quot;splendid career.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The omission of the subsequent facts was perhaps accounted for by the
                        statement that &quot;the history of the part he played in politics is
                        pretty well known,&quot; from which it would appear that the only
                        details impatiently awaited by an expectant world were those concerning his
                        birth, his schooling, his trades, his law practice, and his &quot;two
                        old aunts.&quot;</p>
                    <p>I know a lady who shows great aptitude in acquiring a conversational use of
                        foreign languages-an aptitude due mainly to her fearlessness. She will
                        embark upon the tortuous stream of the most complicated sentence if she has
                        merely a knowledge of the definite article with which to commence it. Once
                        begun (and the article is always a good beginning) the sentence has to
                        unroll itself somehow-and indeed it generally does, though there is often a
                        puzzled expression in the face of the listener when it is concluded.</p>
                    <p>Here the reviewer has given to his inquiring reader the article--not perhaps
                        the definite article, but what of that? If a <pb n="106" id="VAA3906-111"/>
                        courageous imagination can not fill up the void and construct the edifice of
                        a statesman&apos;s life and character by the aid of the specimen brick
                        which is thus furnished, so much the worse for those who lack this
                        imagination.</p>
                    <p>Of course a critic has to choose from what part of a book he will make
                        extracts, but by adopting the theological device of selecting a text
                            <foreign rend="i">ad aperturam libri</foreign> he might make his method
                        of review a little less self-evident.</p>
                    <p rend="sc">THE ENTHUSIASTIC CRITIC</p>
                    <p>Although in the foregoing instance I seemed unable to detain my reviewer and
                        keep him awake beyond the nineteenth page, I find myself reassured by the
                        unconscious flattery of another article, where the critic (though he says
                        very little about the book) seems to have absorbed from its pages an
                        enthusiastic admiration for the hero, and follows the important steps in his
                        career with two columns of approving plaudits. The author of this review
                        does not hesitate to sign his name in full, and his words come like sweet
                        waters after a <pb n="107" id="VAA3906-112"/> toilsome journey, bringing joy
                        to the heart of the biographer and showing him in a most practical way that,
                        however humble may be his task in following the footsteps of the great, it
                        is a task not devoid of opportunities for inspiration.</p>
                    <p rend="sc">THE CAUTIOUS CRITIC</p>
                    <p>But it is not every critic who is willing to &quot; let himself out
                        &quot; in this generous manner. Most of them feel the restraints imposed
                        by the obligations of their awful calling.</p>
                    <p>Some indeed seem to be over-cautious in pronouncing judgment. For instance,
                        one reviewer says of the author&apos;s statement regarding the
                        probability of a conflict between the civilization represented by the Slav
                        and that of the Anglo-Saxon: &quot;We are neither inclined to doubt this
                        nor to affirm it with him.&quot; It is hard to over-praise the
                        discretion of a critic who is unwilling o affirm a proposition upon which he
                        is equally unwilling even to entertain a doubt. It is feared, however, that
                        very few results could be achieved by criticism if its votaries were all so
                        prudent.</p>
                    <pb n="108" id="VAA3906-113"/>
                    <p rend="sc">THE UNDESCRIPTIVE CRITIC</p>
                    <p>But it is not caution alone that produces sterility in criticism. Many
                        reviewers confine their estimates to adjectives which are undescriptive and
                        meaningless.</p>
                    <p>A class in English literature recently met in one of the lecture-rooms of a
                        woman&apos;s college, and the instructor called for criticisms from the
                        students. &quot;Miss -, what have you to say regarding the tragedy of
                        Hamlet?&quot; There was a slight hesitation, a blush, and then an
                        answer, &quot;Why, I liked it, Professor!&quot; and as the exegesis
                        thus concluded, a ripple of laughter went softly round the room.</p>
                    <p>Much of the criticism encounter is of the same character--barring the
                        hesitation and the blush. The books are &quot;interesting,&quot;
                        &quot;well worded,&quot; &quot;readable,&quot;
                        &quot;instructive,&quot; though how or why the reader must find out
                        as best he can.</p>
                    <p>The son of the Vicar of Wakefield learned that the whole secret of the
                        criticism of paintings consisted in a strict adherence to two rules: the
                        one, always to observe that the picture might have been better if the
                        painter had taken more pains; and the other, to praise the works of Pietro
                        Perugino. <pb n="109" id="VAA3906-114"/>The canons of much of our literary
                        criticism seem to be quite as simple. A small catalogue of adjectives,
                        applied indiscriminately, supplies the needs of the art.</p>
                    <p rend="sc">THE TRUCULENT CRITIC</p>
                    <p>But the adjectives are not always complimentary. Some of them, indeed, are so
                        far the opposite as to lead to a suspicion of rabies. I have specially
                        noticed that anti-imperialists, being apostles of &quot;peace and
                        good-will&quot; and opponents of &quot; militarism &quot; and
                        forcible measures, are, more than all others of the children of men, the
                        proprietors and usufructuaries of that vocabulary which naturally leads to
                        armed conflict. While their combativeness may not rise to the dignity of
                        assault and battery, they are more than usually prone to the taking of that
                        preliminary warlike step known to the Hoosier as &quot;a
                        provoke.&quot; One of these special messengers of the olive branch says
                        that the author&apos;s &quot;inexhaustible supply of views&quot;
                        is &quot;nonsensical,&quot; &quot;monstrous,&quot;
                        &quot;a mere appeal to racial hatred of the same low order as that which
                        leads white men to lynch black men,&quot; and that the author <pb
                            n="110" id="VAA3906-115"/> himself, though posing &quot;as an
                        independent and disinterested philosopher&quot; is &quot;the most
                        dangerous kind of demagogue,&quot; fortunately, however, of
                        &quot;the type which is left farthest behind in the race of
                        life.&quot;</p>
                    <p rend="sc">THE CRITIC WITH INSIGHT</p>
                    <p>It is acknowledged, I believe, that the highest and rarest qualification for
                        criticism is &quot;insight,&quot; the power of reasoning from
                        &quot;internal evidence,&quot; from the book back to the writer. By
                        means of this gift, spurious passages are eliminated, genuine manuscripts
                        are distinguished from forgeries, and truth from romance. Nay, more, hidden
                        authorship is sometimes revealed, that of Bacon, for instance, as the writer
                        of Shakespeare&apos;s plays. Whole histories have been written by the
                        aid of this subtile power.</p>
                    <p>Blest with this quality in no small degree, one of my critics has undertaken
                        to write part of my life, constructing it out of the biography which he was
                        reviewing. I moved to Indiana just before the death of its great war
                        governor, and when afterwards I began his biography my prepossessions were
                        not altogether <pb n="111" id="VAA3906-116"/> favorable to him. It was only
                        as the work progressed from day to day, as I delved into contemporary
                        material and saw the rugged but majestic lineaments of an heroic character
                        come slowly forth from the confused masses around it, that doubt gave way to
                        admiration, that the labor became a pleasure, and I followed a great life
                        with sympathy, indeed, yet I hope not without fairness, to its close. But my
                        critic (whose review appeared in the organ of the opposite political party)
                        proceeds to deduce from the biographer&apos;s detailed knowledge of
                        local events the fact that he resided in Indiana at the time. <q
                            type="blockquote">&quot;Probably we are yet too near the stormy
                            period in which be played such a conspicuous-indeed such an
                            overshadowing-part to expect from any writer a judicial view of his
                            character and work. Least of all is this to be expected from one who,
                            like the author of this biography, lived in Indiana throughout that
                            stormy period, and who, although but a boy when that strong stern figure
                            was at the helm, breathed an atmosphere surcharged with passion and
                            prejudice.&quot;</q></p>
                    <p>Happy indeed are those who can thus reason unerringly from effects back to
                        causes, and give true explanation and <pb n="112" id="VAA3906-117"/> excuse
                        for partisan prejudice and political strabismus, all from the internal

                    <p rend="sc">THE ANALYTICAL CRITIC</p>
                    <p>He too finds in a book much of which the author never dreamed. He is the man
                        who &quot;rates&quot; you and &quot;classifies&quot; you, as
                        I am doing now to him by way of retribution.</p>
                    <p>The &quot;reader&quot; of the house which published a story I had
                        written asked me: &quot;How do you classify it? Is it an historical
                        novel, or a pastoral, or a satire?&quot; I answered him that I did not
                        think it was my business to classify it; that as Tammas Haggart said to the
                        club at the pig-sty, &quot;A body canna be expeckit baith to mak a joke
                        and to see&apos;t, that wad be doin&apos; twa fowk&apos;s
                        wark,&quot; neither ought an author to be expected to write a book and
                        to classify it too; that I could only say that if the reader of the volume
                        could get from it a tithe of the pleasure that it gave me to dream the
                        strange scenes of the story (whose background I had seen in remem- <pb
                            n="113" id="VAA3906-118"/> branch), it might still go unclassified and
                        yet I would remain content.</p>
                    <p>Far be it from me to say that discriminating criticism does not exist. Some
                        reviews are admirable, presenting in small compass the gist of a whole work,
                        with observations that are both just and discerning. The judicious reviews
                        are, however, little more than oases in a barren waste. The general average
                        of criticism is sodden enough, and the great mass of reviewers form a motley
                        crew who proffer their half-baked opinions to a public whose mere instinct
                        would be a safer guide than such counsellors.</p>
                    <p>And it is before the judgment-seats of such folly and ignorance that there
                        have been summoned not only the vagabonds and delinquents in authorship, but
                        also those splendid names which, despite the censure of contemporaries, have
                        lived to adorn literature through succeeding generations. It was
                        contemporary criticism which valued Dante for his physics and metaphysics,
                        his absurd theology and smattering of ancient learning, rather than for his
                            <pb n="114" id="VAA3906-119"/> sublime diction and his superb creative
                        power. It was contemporary criticism which crippled the French drama by
                        senseless and arbitrary rules; which estimated the poetry of Milton as
                        inferior to that of Dryden; which puffed the wretched Montgomery into
                        gigantic stature; which sought to stifle the first flight of
                        Byron&apos;s muse; which hounded Tennyson through long years of
                        uncertainty, and smothered the flame of Keats&apos;s genius in
                        disappointment and death.</p>
                    <p>In view, then, of the frailties of criticism, what is to be done? Advice is
                        the common and inexhaustible capital of all mankind, the one kind of wealth
                        whereof prodigality entails no future want. Let me offer, therefore, three
                        words of advice.</p>
                    <p>The first is to the editor of the newspaper or periodical, and it is
                        this:</p>
                    <p>Do not try to criticise all the books that are sent to you and which you have
                        not the time, even if you have the other qualifications, to review properly,
                        but organize, if you will, a syndicate in criticism, a harmless sort of a
                        trust, which can specialize the work and have it adequately performed. Then
                        you may print, simultaneously from <pb n="115" id="VAA3906-120"/> slips or
                        from &quot;boiler plate,&quot; something which at least will not
                        make you ridiculous.</p>
                    <p>Second, since the press is very slow in taking advice, and may not take mine,
                        we had better not wait till this great transformation is effected, so my
                        next bit of counsel must be to the public, and it is:</p>
                    <p>Do not believe a word the reviewer tells you, but judge for yourself.</p>
                    <p>And now in the third place, to my dear fellow author, whom I love more
                        tenderly than &quot;any little reptile of a critic,&quot; and far
                        more than I love the world at large, to him I would impart in confidence the
                        advice once given me by one of great skill and experience in such matters.
                        He told me that if I wanted to be sure of a &quot;good&quot; review,
                        I had better &quot;write it out&quot; myself. While I listened to
                        his words the clouds parted and a great field of wonders lay spread before
                        my imagination. &quot;Is it possible,&quot; I thought,
                        &quot;that the authors themselves are the sources of those appreciative
                        reviews that appear in periodicals which I have considered the repositories
                        of literary wisdom? Can it be that criticism is like a Cyclopaedia of <pb
                            n="116" id="VAA3906-121"/> Contemporary Biography, where each flattering
                        display of eminent and charming qualities is furnished (together with a
                        liberal subscription) by the gentleman who forms the subject of the
                        sketch?&quot;</p>
                    <p>I know not, for I am unsophisticated. But it is wise to be on the safe side
                        and take no chances, so if you want a &quot;good&quot; review, and
                        are sure you can get it published, you had better &quot;write it
                        out&quot; yourself.</p>

                    <head rend="center">A BROAD VIEW OF THE DISAD-<lb/> VANTAGES OF A
                        UNIVERSITY<lb/> EDUCATION</head>
                    <p>It is a very limited horizon that most people have of this great world. Very
                        few can realize that there is anything really important in it beyond the
                        narrow sphere of their own activities. The man, for instance, who is
                        accustomed to the social advantages of the metropolis finds it hard to
                        understand how one who has always lived on a remote plantation of the South
                        may be as courtly a gentleman as any in the circle with which he is
                        familiar. The man from the far West, on the other hand, finds it impossible
                        to believe that those who have been brought up in the lap of luxury in the
                        East can have those sturdy qualities and that manly courage which he regards
                        as the best part of his own character.</p>
                    <pb n="118" id="VAA3906-123"/>
                    <p>In a limited way, I know something of these misunderstandings, for about half
                        of my life has been spent in the East, and the remainder in the Mississippi
                        valley. There is many a man on the Atlantic seaboard who considers all that
                        lies beyond the Alleghanies wild and woolly, and there are not a few who
                        dwell in the valley of the Mississippi who consider the people of the East
                        snobbish, effete, degenerate. In point of fact, while the Western man has
                        generally less of what is technically labelled culture than his Eastern
                        brother, he has, on the other hand, I think, broader and juster views of
                        life, and perhaps quite as ample a knowledge of the things most necessary
                        for the practical conduct of life.</p>
                    <p>The same kind of misunderstanding exists between the college man and the man
                        who has not had the benefits of a university education. The graduate of the
                        universities can not always appreciate the many splendid intellectual
                        qualities required for the development of a great business enterprise by a
                        man who, perhaps, can not speak the English language correctly; while, on
                        the other hand, the successful <pb n="119" id="VAA3906-124"/> business man
                        is apt to look with contempt upon the training of the university.</p>
                    <p>There is little need to speak of the benefits conferred by the higher
                        education, but since the ability to look at a question on all sides is among
                        the most rare as well as the most valuable of human endowments, I desire to
                        offer some suggestions in regard to the disadvantages of a university
                        training, and to express some opinions quite different from those I used to
                        hold when I was a student.</p>
                    <p>I can remember that at that time we all quickly became impressed with what we
                        considered the aristocracy of cap and gown, the feeling that the college man
                        was inevitably a superior being to the non-college man. This feeling was
                        most aggressive, I think, during our Freshman year. By the time we became
                        Seniors the consciousness of this superiority had softened down so that
                        while it was to be taken as a matter of course, it did not need to be
                        asserted. With the years which have followed graduation, it has, I think,
                        become extinct. We now meet the rest of the world on equal terms. Indeed,
                        many of us have come to recognize as our actual superiors in intellect <pb
                            n="120" id="VAA3906-125"/> men who do not know one word of Greek or
                        Latin, men who could not prove, to save themselves from perdition, that the
                        square of the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle was equal to the sum of
                        the squares of the other two sides.</p>
                    <p>We need not be told, for we all know, that an educated man of equal merit and
                        energy has a better chance in life than he who has not had access to the
                        training that our institutions of learning afford; just as a rich man, who
                        remains uncorrupted by the luxury which wealth encourages, has a better
                        chance in the long run than a poor man. But there is not seldom a gain in
                        the absence of these advantages. The very lack of them will sometimes nerve
                        the man of pluck to more earnest efforts, and while we find a large
                        proportion of university men among the successful and distinguished men of
                        the world, let us not forget that some of the most illustrious of all have
                        been men without such opportunities. Shakespeare, the greatest of
                        dramatists, placed Bohemia by the shores of the sea; Washington, the first
                        of Americans, could not always spell correctly; Lincoln, preeminent among
                        the statesmen of this cen- <pb n="121" id="VAA3906-126"/> tury, drew his
                        inspiration, not from the school, but from the forest and the farm; Herbert
                        Spencer, first among living philosophers, studied at home; John Bright, the
                        most distinguished among the English orators of his generation, received
                        nothing but a business education. These things tell us that, after all, it
                        is the man, rather than his technical training, which is the most important
                        ingredient in ultimate success, and that the college is not the only place
                        in which to procure an education. Those who have been brought up within its
                        walls are apt to form too narrow a conception of what education means. They
                        imagine that it is co-extensive with the curriculum. If they have studied
                        languages, mathematics, logic, and philosophy, they think that languages,
                        mathematics, logic, and philosophy constitute an education.</p>
                    <p>Now this misunderstanding of the real perspective in education is all but
                        universal. Each community has its own standard. The education demanded of
                        the Chinaman who seeks political place, in many matters greatly exceeds our
                        own requirements. He must give explanations by chapters and sentences of the
                        commentaries on the classic <pb n="122" id="VAA3906-127"/>philosophy of
                        China. He must point out the inaccuracies of the old sages who wrote of
                        &quot;astronomy and the five elements.&quot; He must criticise the
                        estimates of the character of reigning princes made by the ancient
                        historians. This kind of examination involves a wide range of reading in the
                        native literature, though it contracts the mind to look upon that literature
                        as containing all that is worth knowing in the world.</p>
                    <p>A man may have the scientific knowledge of an Edison, or the philosophy of a
                        Spencer, yet by the Chinese test he will still be very ignorant. And with
                        us, a mandarin may have devoted half a lifetime to amassing the abstruse and
                        recondite lore contained in the writings of the fathers of the Celestial
                        Empire, yet according to our standard he knows very little. Many of our own
                        educators have been guilty of narrow-mindedness of this sort. They have
                        conventionalized certain things (not always the most useful and desirable)
                        and have labelled these things an education. Whatever his scientific
                        education may be, the man who has not been through the classical course of
                        the German University <pb n="123" id="VAA3906-128"/> is an
                        &quot;Ungebildeter Mensch.&quot; There is always a tendency about
                        the thing technically called an education to arrogate to itself a
                        superiority over that kind of training which is not accompanied by the
                        proper trademark. Now there are things not set down in the curriculum which
                        to some men are a better education than Latin, logic, mathematics, or
                        philosophy. In tracking his game or his enemy, the Indian is better educated
                        than we. What we need is a proper catholic spirit, which appreciates
                        knowledge of every kind wherever found, and which is ready to extend the
                        right hand of fellowship to every form of useful instruction, though it be
                        not of our own kind.</p>
                    <p>The instances are not few in which the learning of the time has been a
                        positive detriment to the natural growth of science and even of letters. The
                        &quot;forty immortals&quot; of the French Academy, the learned
                        arbiters and censors of French literature, have had, it seems to me, a most
                        injurious effect upon the development of that literature. The stern rules
                        laid down for the conduct of the drama, verse and rhyme inexorably
                        prescribed, the narrow unities of <pb n="124" id="VAA3906-129"/> time,
                        place, and dramatic action autocratically imposed, the &quot;harmony of
                        colors&quot; insisted upon to such a degree that servants and subalterns
                        must speak the same poetic dialect as the heroes of the play,-all these
                        things crippled and deformed the French drama, until it became a colorless
                        imitation of Greek models, instead of a luxuriant growth, developing
                        according to natural laws. And even to-day the art of rhetoric, very useful
                        when offered as the adviser of talent, becomes positively noxious when it
                        assumes the functions of an autocrat and tyrant of literary production. In
                        letters, as well as in political life, the largest liberty is the condition
                        of the healthiest development; and literary genius, like organic life, must
                        grow and bear fruit, not according to the rules which learning prescribes,
                        but according to the laws of its own being, according to the individual
                        characteristics of the author.</p>
                    <p>It ought to make the man of learning modest to reflect how much of error
                        there has been in the so-called knowledge of the time. How long the world
                        has been in unlearning the things that have been learned before! How long it
                        took mankind <pb n="125" id="VAA3906-130"/> to disbelieve the Ptolemaic
                        theory that the sun revolved around the earth! What a flood of orthodox
                        erudition was poured out upon Galileo!</p>
                    <p>The learning of one generation is often the laughing-stock of the next. How
                        many hundreds of years did the learned disciples of alchemy seek the
                        Philosopher&apos;s Stone, which was to turn the dross and refuse of the
                        world into gold! For how many centuries have theology and law joined hands
                        for the suppression of the impossible crime of witchcraft! How many millions
                        of human beings have died unnaturally under the manipulations of the men of
                        medicine, who bled them and dosed them until the forces of nature refused to
                        react and their lives became sacrifices to the learned misinformation of the
                        medical profession!</p>
                    <p>What would have been the future of this New World if the daring originality
                        of Columbus had succumbed to the learning of the Council of Salamanca? For
                        how many generations did the absurd and useless distinctions between
                        nominalists, realists, and conceptualists distract the learned world! What a
                        clog the metaphysical learning of past centuries has been upon <pb n="126"
                            id="VAA3906-131"/> the real advancement of science and civilization! For
                        how many centuries did knowledge remain stationary because men sought it
                        only in the lore of the fathers, in the vellums of a brighter and more
                        original antiquity! All this time Nature was vocal with a cry to be
                        interpreted. She uttered it in the thunder, demanding that man should
                        explore and train to his service the forces which forged the thunderbolt.
                        She hissed in steam her scornful reprobation of the ignorance which knew not
                        how to harness that mighty agent to ships and chariots of the world. In the
                        petals of every flower she besought mankind to unfold the methods of its
                        growth and beauty. In beast and bird and fish she held up to eyes that would
                        not see, that great law of evolution by which every marvel of organic life
                        has been developed from the simplest cell. From the stars she flashed the
                        message what they were, and asked nothing but the spectroscope for the
                        interpretation. But through all these ages, the learning of the world, shut
                        up in cloisters, reiterated, parrot-like, the truths and errors of past
                        times and spent itself in metaphysical subtleties.</p>
                    <pb n="127" id="VAA3906-132"/>
                    <p>And can we say of the learning of to-day that it is free from this same
                        fault? Do we not still often mistake the arbitrary product of our
                        imagination for the final truth of science? I remember studying in college a
                        system of Empirical Psychology, as it was called, <hi rend="i">The Mind as
                            Revealed in Consciousness</hi>, and my only criticism of the very
                        learned work which formed our textbook was that the mind was thus revealed
                        to the consciousness of some other man, not to mine. To him it might be the
                        truth of science, to me it was the work of a not very healthy
                        imagination.</p>
                    <p>When so much of the learning of the schoolmen has turned out false, what
                        security have we that the lore into which we have been delving is the
                        ultimate truth? Time perhaps will tell, though it may not be the time in
                        which we live.</p>
                    <p>Yet even in our own time we discover the error of much of our instruction.
                        Take for example the so-called science of political economy, where we
                        deduced by most irrefutable logic that the men who bought in the cheapest
                        market and sold in the dearest, contributed, by means of the beneficent and
                        permanent law of competition, to the <pb n="128" id="VAA3906-133"/> ultimate
                        wealth and happiness of mankind. But now a great doubt arises whether
                        competition is not destructive of itself as well as of the multitudes who
                        perish under the wheels of its heavy car, and the effort of all modern
                        industrial life is to avoid, by wise and economical co-operation, its
                        needless waste and destruction.</p>
                    <p>So here let me utter a precept of great academic heresy. Let us not believe
                        all we have been taught. Most of it may be true, but unless history is
                        false, all of it can not be. Let books and instruction advise and guide us,
                        but never control our own convictions. We may ourselves add to the sum of
                        man&apos;s knowledge something wiser and truer than that which they
                        contain. Let us keep our minds in that receptive condition which is willing
                        not only to learn, but to unlearn, and this from every source-from books,
                        from the world, from nature, and from the light within our souls.</p>
                    <p>A wise man is equally removed from that illiterate dogmatism which asserts
                        that all valuable knowledge is found in practical experience, outside of
                        books, and the pedantry which considers that it is all in <pb n="129"
                            id="VAA3906-134"/> books. There is one kind of knowledge, extremely
                        valuable to all of us, which must be acquired mainly by experience with the
                        world. This is our knowledge of men. We can not learn this from the printed
                        page. Shakespeare may lay bare the hidden mainsprings of human action;
                        Tolstoi may dissect human nature until we are astounded and shocked by the
                        faithfulness of the portrait; but, after all, it is a certain native
                        intuition combined with practical experience which gives us the best
                        knowledge of men. It is outside the walls of the lecture room that these
                        lessons must be learned. A life of constant intercourse with our fellows is
                        the school which best instructs us what they are and what we are
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p>There is another kind of culture which no books can furnish, which no
                        institution of learning can supply-the culture of those spiritual faculties,
                        those electrical forces of our nature so elusive to the touch, yet so
                        powerful in overcoming all things.</p>
                    <p>Let us not lose sight of that quality which no academic examination can test,
                        but which is nevertheless the divinest of all human gifts-enthusiasm.
                        Learning alone <pb n="130" id="VAA3906-135"/> has not accomplished half so
                        much. From books alone men rarely drink its inspiration. Its source lies
                        deeper. It was the enthusiasm of the unlettered Mahomet which drew forth
                        those millions of Saracen cimeters for the conquest of the world. It was the
                        enthusiasm of Peter the Hermit which gave birth to the era of the Crusades.
                        It was the enthusiasm of the early abolitionists which began the agitation
                        that culminated in the overthrow of African slavery. Every martyr whose
                        blood has resanctified religion, every daring aggressor whose new thought
                        has added to the truths of science, every Galileo, every Huss, every Luther,
                        every Columbus, attests the power of enthusiasm even more than the power of
                        intellectual culture. It was in the enthusiasm and utter devotion of the
                        unlettered fishermen that Jesus saw fitter instruments for the propagation
                        of his gospel than in priest, rabbi, scribe, or Pharisee learned in the laws
                        of Moses and the Prophets. Unless we have this gift we may have all the
                        learning of the time, and it will be of little avail. Learning is valuable
                        only on the condition that it does not destroy this greater and more godlike
                        quality.</p>
                    <pb n="131" id="VAA3906-136"/>
                    <p>Let us believe in ourselves. Not that confidence which arrogates any
                        superiority over our fellows, but the faith which through every disaster
                        continually whispers in our ears the prophecy that we will win. We may work
                        long and see no result. We may knock and hear no answer, nor will an answer
                        come except to that obsinate endeavor which through years of irresponsive
                        silence still keeps heart.</p>
                    <p>How many times has every great man been pushed back in his career! How often
                        has genius labored under the burden of disappointment! What must have been
                        Milton&apos;s discouragement when five pounds was the uttermost he could
                        extract from the cupidity of his time for his immortal epic! What must have
                        been the weight of disappointment which oppressed Carlyle when he carried
                        the manuscript of <hi rend="i">Sartor Resartus</hi> from publisher to
                        publisher and found no one to take it! How wonderfully has Carlyle himself
                        described man&apos;s struggle and triumph in that admirable passage in
                        his Essay upon Mirabeau!</p>
                    <q type="blockquote">&quot;Victory,&quot; he says, &quot;is always
                        joyful; but to think of such a man in the hour when, after twelve
                        Hercules&apos; Labors, he does finally triumph! So long he fought <pb
                            n="132" id="VAA3906-137"/> with the many-headed coil of Lernean erpent;
                        and panting, wrestled and wrang with it for life or death,-- forty long
                        stern years; and now he has it under his heel! The mountain tops are scaled,
                        are scaled, where the man climbed, on sharp flinty precipice, slippery,
                        abysmal; in darkness, seen by no kind eye,-amid the brood of dragons; and
                        the heart, many times, was like to fail within him in his loneliness, it,
                        his extreme need; yet he climbed, and climbed, gluing his footsteps in his
                        blood; and now behold, Hyperion-like he has scaled it, and on the summit
                        shakes his glittering shafts of war! What a scene and new kingdom for him!
                        all bathed in auroral radiance of hope; tar-stretching, solemn, joyful, what
                        wild Memnon&apos;s music, from the depths of Nature, comes toning
                        through the soul raised suddenly out of strangling death into victory and
                        life!&quot;</q>
                    <p>So, too, must we believe if we will win the victory. It will not come to all,
                        but more surely than to others it will come to him who, through years of
                        discouragement, works on unflinchingly and will not yield.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the main purpose of life is to make of our natures fit soil for the
                        seed of opportunity. It maybe that unto one of us some sacred charge maybe
                        given. After a thousand commonplace utterances, he may speak one word, and
                        it shall be God&apos;s message to the world. Amid a thousand perishable
                        pages he may write one line that will live as long as the eternal hills.
                        After <pb n="133" id="VAA3906-138"/> a thousand fruitless questionings,
                        Nature may teach him one simple law or tell him one new fact, and his place
                        shall be with Newton, and Priestley, and Copernicus.</p>
                    <p>Let us so prepare our lives that if the call comes we shall be ready, that to
                        the voice of the spirit our ears shall be alert, and the answer shall be
                        upon our lips, &quot;Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.&quot;</p>

                    <head rend="center">A BASEBALL ROMANCE</head>
                    <p>BLOCK Island is about fifteen miles away --right out at sea. We can see the
                        coast of the island very faintly on a fine day, and a steamer makes daily
                        trips thither when the weather is fair, but of late our communication has
                        been much interrupted by the storms and the heavy sea. There is a large
                        hotel on the island, and the guests there wanted to be neighborly, so they
                        invited our athletic association to send a picked nine to meet them in a
                        friendly game of baseball. Our boys started out full of hope, and we awaited
                        their return with confidence that they would maintain the credit of our
                        association, but they came back with a score against them of nineteen to
                        one. Some grumblers talked about a professional in the Block Island nine,
                        and a dissatisfied man remarked that they did n&apos;t go over there to
                        play against the colored waiters of <pb n="135" id="VAA3906-140"/> the
                        hotel. But Jenkins, who had charge of our association, silenced the
                        grumblers, told them they ought to be grateful for the courteous treatment
                        they had received, and that we must do our best to entertain the Block
                        Island men properly when they came over to play with us. So the charge of
                        the matter was placed in Jenkins&apos;s hands. We all have confidence in
                        Jenkins. To-day the Block Island men came; a special tug brought them over,
                        and we paid part of the expense. They were our guests, and we were bound the
                        entertainment should be a success. We brought down a brass band from
                        Westerly, a gorgeous-looking band with white coats and gold lace,-a regular
                        Austrian band in appearance,-and we all marched out to the end of the long
                        pier to the tune of Boulanger&apos;s march, to welcome the visitors. The
                        sea was high, the tug had been pitching frightfully, and there were signs
                        that our guests had not been enjoying themselves, but we tried to cheer them
                        with our music and happy faces and to make things pleasant for them.</p>
                    <p>Our color was red and theirs was blue. The place fairly blossomed with red
                        flags, red ribbons, red sashes, and red headgear. <pb n="136"
                            id="VAA3906-141"/> The boys pulled out the lower slats from the window
                        shades, tacked on pieces of red cloth to make little tags, and marched in
                        solid column, looking like a band of young anarchists. We talked cheerfully
                        to the Block Island men, but we did not express much confidence that we
                        could beat them. Jenkins was sorry to tell them that three or four of our
                        nine were sick and he had to pick up a scrub lot of fellows to fill their
                        places. Indeed, he had been compelled to take a waiter or two from the hotel
                        to &quot;fill up.&quot; One of these was a little, innocent-looking,
                        baby-faced darkey, who rejoiced in the name of Alfred Jupiter Smith. It was
                        easy to see that &quot;Jupiter&quot; (for Alfred and Smith did
                        n&apos;t count as parts of his name) never could have had much
                        experience in baseball, nor, indeed, in anything else.</p>
                    <p>Then there was another man whom Jenkins had &quot;picked up&quot;
                        because he could do no better. This man was professor, and a rather
                        seedy-looking one at that. His shoulders stooped, he wore spectacles, he had
                        a &quot;far-off&quot; look and seemed to be studying astronomy; he
                        often rubbed his hands gently together and stood on his first <pb n="137"
                            id="VAA3906-142"/> base looking vacantly into space, with one suspender
                        unbuttoned. We all wondered why on earth Jenkins had assigned such an
                        important place as first base to that sort of a man. But Providence always
                        favors the unfortunate, and it could be nothing less than a special
                        Providence which dropped all those balls into his hand just at the right
                        instant, to put out some Block Islander who was running for first base. The
                        hand which caught the ball always happened to be the one next to the fellow
                        who was trying to make his base, and it seemed to touch him
                        involuntarily.</p>
                    <p>The &quot;professor&quot; looked so sleepy through his spectacles
                        that the Block Islanders tried to steal bases from him, and it was not until
                        after five of them had been caught out in the attempt that they came to the
                        conclusion he was actually awake. And then Jupiter! The little fellow was
                        worthy of the great Olympian whose name he bore. Before the game began we
                        openly expressed to the Block Island men our disapproval that Jenkins should
                        make such an insignificant waiter boy the pitcher of our nine at such a
                        time, and when they saw him they offered to increase the odds <pb n="137"
                            id="VAA3906-143"/> against us. We bore this affront with patience, but I
                        afterwards learned that some of our people consented to take the offered
                        terms (ten to one) &quot;just to stand by our home nine, not because
                        there was any chance of winning.&quot; But as soon as Jupiter began to
                        pitch, the Block Islanders batted wildly &quot; into thin air&quot;
                        and sometimes rolled over in the attempt. Not once in a dozen times could
                        they even run to first base, and if they did their joy only lasted for a
                        moment. They got no farther. The small boys who sat in long rows on the
                        hillside near the grand stand soon began to shout in chorus,
                        &quot;What&apos;s the matter with Jupiter? H-e-&apos;s
                        a-l-r-i-g-h-t,&quot; and then they turned somersaults in concert, and
                        kicked their feet in the air all at the same time and yelled a new cheer,
                        &quot;Jupiter! Jupiter! Wah! Hoo! Wah!&quot; At each new stroke of
                        fine play the joyful clash of cymbals resounded from the row of seats
                        against the fence, which were occupied by the Austrian band, while a tinge
                        of melancholy overspread the fair faces on the front rows of the grand
                        stand. These seats had been reserved for the ladies who came with the Block
                        Islanders, to share the glory of their expected triumph.</p>
                    <pb n="139" id="VAA3906-144"/>
                    <p>The catcher, too, was another man selected &quot;on the spur of the
                        moment.&quot; But in baseball, as in public speaking, it is the
                        impromptu which succeeds, and I suspect it is just the same sort of
                        impromptu. This catcher had a way of getting the ball before the batter had
                        any chance at it. He never missed. Certainly Jenkins was in luck when he hit
                        upon those three men. One inning after another was played and Block Island
                        could not make a run. Thirteen to nothing was the score at the end of the
                        sixth inning. The time was short, the guests had to leave and there was only
                        one more inning to be played. Then a forgiving smile stole over the fine,
                        benevolent countenance of Mr. Jenkins. He said something to the catcher
                        which we did not hear, but immediately afterward the ball struck the
                        catcher&apos;s arm and hurt him badly, so that he missed several times
                        and the Block Islanders triumphantly made three runs at the finish, amid the
                        wildest shrieks of delight from the fair companions of their journey and
                        amid the equally emphatic shrieks of derision from the small boys. So the
                        game closed 13 to 3 in our favor.</p>
                    <pb n="139" id="VAA3906-145"/>
                    <p>Then our band struck up a proud anthem of triumph, the small boys with their
                        red flags led the way; we formed a hollow square around our immortal nine
                        and marched in solemn state back to the hotel, amid the waving of hundreds
                        of fair hands and handkerchiefs brought thither to witness our revenge. The
                        Block Islanders were cordially invited to come along, but they neither
                        shared our enthusiasm nor appreciated our delicate attentions. In less than
                        thirty seconds after the game closed not one of them could be seen. Ever
                        since the game began they had spent the time howling, first at the umpire,
                        then at the catcher, then at Jenkins, then at the whole of us, and even the
                        three runs at the finish did not dissipate their unreasonable irritation.
                        The last we heard of them was that a man had hurried into the telegraph
                        office and sent the following to Block Island:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Beaten; thirteen to three--professional battery.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The last we saw of them they were climbing solemnly into the tug one after
                        another, and the last we saw of the tug it was tossing like a cork upon the
                        waves. It was not yet out of sight when Jenkins <pb n="141" id="VAA3906-146"
                        /> called around him the members of the Athletic Association. His finger was
                        placed suggestively at the side of his nose. This is not one of the signs of
                        the association, but we all recognized it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, boys, are we even?&quot;</p>
                    <p>A quiet chuckle was the appropriate answer.</p>
                    <p>A little behind us stood Amos-Amos the prophet, as we call him--a
                        dark-skinned son of Ethiopia, who distributes the morning news to us at five
                        cents a copy. His joy was deep, but it seemed not wholly unalloyed. His
                        smile had a chastened look.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Amos, did you come out ahead?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sah, but only ten dollars, sah, and when dey was such a chance
                        it ought to ben fifty!&quot;</p>

                    <head rend="center">A VISIT TO YUCATAN</head>
                    <p>No one is lured to Yucatan by the advertisements of railway or steamship
                        lines, or by delusive circulars setting forth the charms of a personally
                        conducted tour through fairyland. On the contrary, the great difficulty is
                        to find out anything about that peninsula at all. It is a sail of only
                        thirty-six hours from Havana to Progreso, yet scarcely anybody in Havana
                        could give me any information about Yucatan. I asked the salesmen in a
                        number of bookstores if they had a guide to the country. They smiled as they
                        answered that they had never heard of such a thing. Steamers of the Ward
                        Line sail every week to Progreso. I sought information at the office of that
                        company, but nobody knew anything. I learned there was a railroad to Merida,
                        but whether it went any farther no one could tell. There was a Mexican <pb
                            n="143" id="VAA3906-148"/> fan merchant on the Calle Oblispo-perhaps he
                        would know. I sought him out. He had been to Merida, but knew of nothing
                        beyond.</p>
                    <p>&quot;ls there a hotel there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it a good one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Bad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How bad?&quot;You have travelled in Spain?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have seen bad hotels there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very bad?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, this is worse than any you have ever seen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is the matter with it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The first two or three nights you will not sleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why? On account of the mosquitoes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot; Yes, the mosquitoes, and-everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This offered a large field for the imagination.</p>
                    <p>Then I went to the Mexican Consul, a courteous gentleman, who told us what
                        little there was to tell of the railroads in Yucatan, showed us the time
                        tables and <pb n="144" id="VAA3906-149"/> rates of fare, assured us that
                        there was a hotel in Progreso as well as in Merida and other places, and
                        when we asked how good they were, answered, &quot;They are plain, but
                        that will add to the interest of your visit.&quot; There were vehicles,
                        he said, to take us to the old ruins; the climate was hot, but not specially
                        unhealthy in the winter season, and a number of persons went every year,
                        both from Mexico and from foreign parts, to see these stately relics of
                        aboriginal civilization. So we resolved to take &quot;pot luck&quot;
                        in climate, hotels, and whatever else was to befound in Yucatan. The Mexican
                        Consul did not speak English, but he made the little Spanish that we knew go
                        a long way, understanding without difficulty the conglomerate in which we
                        struggled to express ourselves, and he illustrated his answers with such apt
                        gesticulation that we could hardly have failed to make them out if they had
                        been Sanskrit or Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Then we went to the money-changers to get some Mexican silver for our
                        greenbacks. Twenty dollars apiece seemed little enough to begin with, yet
                        when we got two for one in big Mexican coin we began to feel as if we had
                        too much ballast aboard, and <pb n="145" id="VAA3906-150"/> we could realize
                        in a small way the meaning of the laws of Lycurgus, which established iron
                        as the currency for Sparta.</p>
                    <p>We left Havana in the midst of a squall of rain and wind on the <hi rend="i"
                            >Orizaba</hi>, a beautiful, large steamer of the Ward Line, and we were
                        surprised, after we had passed the narrow strait which connects the bay with
                        the sea, to find how well she rode the huge swells that came in
                        &quot;dead ahead.&quot; But our satisfaction was short-lived. We
                        changed our course a little and the wind shifted still more, so when night
                        set in we were in the trough of the sea and the steamer was rolling most
                        unpleasantly. We tried to sleep, but were tossed about in such lively
                        fashion that our energies were devoted exclusively to keeping in our berths.
                        One lady, who had propped herself in with pillows, was thrown headlong upon
                        the floor. We could hear the dishes crashing in the pantry and doubted
                        whether enough would be left to set the breakfast table. Water poured in in
                        great quantities, and our efforts to dress next morning were acrobatic
                        performances unusual even in great storms. A &quot;Norte&quot; was
                        blowing and the sea was high, but the dancing of the boat <pb n="146"
                            id="VAA3906-151"/> was greatly in excess of the requirements of the
                        storm. The cook was pitched head-long across the kitchen. An old gentleman
                        who stood at the door of the smoking-room was sent flying to the other side
                        of the apartment and then back again, cutting his head and hand very badly.
                        One of my companions had an ugly gash across his thumb, and at the table the
                        breakfast and dinner rolled into our laps. Toward evening the wind
                        slackened, but as the steamer was flat-bottomed and had little cargo, it
                        refused to be comforted. Next day the weather was rather better and we
                        anchored in the open roadstead at Progreso. A tug came out to meet us,
                        tossing like a cork on the water, and one after another we took a
                        &quot;leap for life&quot; upon her deck as she rose on the short,
                        jerky waves. The women were lowered in heavy casks, cut open at one end and
                        part way down one of the sides. They were swung off from the steamer, and as
                        the tug rose were caught by men below and hauled down. There was much
                        weeping and screaming, but all were at last safely deposited upon the little
                        boat and we steamed for the shore, some two miles away, where a long iron
                        pier <pb n="147" id="VAA3906-152"/> projected into the sea. There was much
                        difficulty in landing, but finally we all came safely off and walked down
                        the pier to the custom-house. The custom-house inspector at Progreso did his
                        duty. He insisted that everything should be opened, he looked through every
                        parcel, however small, but he gave no unnecessary trouble and he expected no
                        fee. Indeed, Yucatan is one of the few countries where
                        &quot;tips&quot; are not generally given. It has not yet been
                        spoiled by the tourist. The cars on the railway to Merida are like those in
                        the United States, but there is no upholstery, as this would be inconvenient
                        in the climate of Yucatan. The land is very flat. We passed through a forest
                        of stunted trees and bushes until we reached the haciendas, where henequin
                        was planted in long rows like Indian corn. On these farms there are <foreign
                            rend="i">ingenios</foreign>, or factories for reducing the plant into
                        hemp for exportation. Around each farmhouse is a grove of palm and
                        laurel.</p>
                    <p>After an hour or more we reached Merida. We secured quarters at the Hotel
                        Independencia, taking our meals at the Lonja Club, two squares away. My room
                        opened upon a little balcony overlooking <pb n="148" id="VAA3906-153"/> the
                        plaza. The ceiling of this room was nearly twenty feet high, the floor was
                        of brick tile, the bed was a cot with no mattress, and above it was seta
                        scaffold for the mosquito net. The hotel was a stone building, one hundred
                        and ten years old, with quite original sculptures over the doors and
                        windows. The outside was covered with stucco and decorated in imitation of
                        stone, much like our own fashion of painting our woodwork, and then graining
                        it so as to resemble the wood which has just been covered up. The plaza was
                        very beautiful in the bright moonlight. There were white walks and green
                        trees, over the tops of which appeared on the left the massy gray walls of
                        the Cathedral of Merida, a huge building of the conventional Spanish type,
                        and on the right the graceful tower of the Ayuntamiento, or City Hall, and
                        the Corinthian portico of a new business building-all looking very fresh and
                        clean.</p>
                    <p>In the winter season Merida is a pleasant city. It is an inland Havana on a
                        small scale, with many of the evil odors and much of the dirt eliminated. It
                        has its tramways and its electric lights, but still it <pb n="149"
                            id="VAA3906-154"/> bears the appearance of antiquity. When we arrived,
                        the air was fresh and next morning it was too cool to be comfortable, but
                        this was exceptional weather, even for February. During a few hours in the
                        middle of the day the sun&apos;s rays poured down with great vigor and
                        we sought speedy shelter from them. A visit to the market the next morning
                        revealed the fact that this day had been a St. Bartholomew for the dogs of
                        Merida. They were lying dead in heaps and rows, destroyed by the poisonous
                        wiles of the butchers whose meat they had consumed without proper payment.
                        This and the weekly cock fight (a prominent feature among the amusements of
                        the city), as well as the brutal treatment of the poor little horses that
                        drag the cabs through the streets, reveal the worst side of the
                        Spanish-American character-its insensibility to the feelings of dumb
                        beasts.</p>
                    <p>The Lonja Club occupies one of the finest buildings in the city, a large,
                        one-story edifice covering much ground, with a courtyard in the middle,
                        galleries around, and on the outside of these the rooms of the club,
                        restaurant, library, etc. In the courtyard a temporary stage had been
                        constructed, for <pb n="150" id="VAA3906-155"/> the club was to give a
                        dramatic performance the evening after our arrival in the city. By the
                        kindness of one of the members we were invited and the spectacle was a fine
                        one. All the beauty and fashion of Merida were seated in the open court and
                        in the por- ticos around it, under a brilliant moon, and the best amateurs
                        of the city were playing a little farce, followed by a <foreign rend="i"
                            >zarzuela</foreign>, a conventional, light musical comedy, written in
                        rhyme, common in all Spanish countries. But we did not stay long. A greater
                        attraction drew us away-a Mestizo ball in another part of the city. We
                        hurried thither and found, in a large building, some two or three hundred
                        Mestizos, all clad in spotless white, dancing their national dances, as well
                        as the quadrilles and waltzes which are now the common possession of
                        civilized humanity.</p>
                    <p>The dress of the men and women was much the same as that which they wore upon
                        the street, but it was elegantly decorated. The men wore the same sandals,
                        each composed of a leather sole fastened by thongs to the bare foot; the
                        same white trousers or drawers, with the white shirt over them; but the
                        shirt was elaborately <pb n="151" id="VAA3906-156"/> embroidered and
                        sometimes fastened with a set of diamond studs. The women had slippers on
                        their otherwise bare feet. Their stiffly starched white skirts were
                        embroidered very delicatey with small figures in bright colors at the
                        bottom, and a sort of tunic, cut low at the neck and falling over the skirt
                        as far as the knees, was embroidered in the same way near the edges, both at
                        the top and bottom. This is so elaborately done that it is often the work of
                        months and years. The Mestizo women are fond of jewelry, and are often
                        bedecked with heavy gold chains, necklaces, and other ornaments. Their stiff
                        black hair is combed back and done up in a little roll behind the head.
                        Their faces are not pretty, but have a very amiable expression. The conduct
                        of both men and women at the ball was perfectly decorous, and those who had
                        charge of the entertainment were most hospitable.</p>
                    <p>These Mestizos, a mixed race descended from the Maya Indians and their
                        Spanish conquerors, form the artisan class in Merida. They do not seem to
                        have inherited the bloodthirsty characteristics attributed to either of the
                        races from which they have <pb n="152" id="VAA3906-157"/> come; they are a
                        docile, sweet-tempered people, quite intelligent, and as industrious as can
                        be expected in this tropical climate. They will do you a favor when they
                        can, and they are fairly honest-that is, they will
                        &quot;borrow&quot; your cake of soap but will leave your $50 bill
                        untouched. So, at least, they were described to us, and so we found them,
                        except that, although we left our rooms open and our baggage unpacked, we
                        never missed the cake of soap. They speak both Spanish and their own Maya
                        tongue, a language described by the Spaniards as &quot;quite like
                        English&quot;--that is, it sounds a little like it to those who cannot
                        understand the words, as it has many consonants and many monosyllables, and
                        the grammar shows a similar lack of inflections. There is certainly no other
                        likeness.</p>
                    <p>The next afternoon we took the train for Ticul, one of the larger villages of
                        Yucatan, about fifty miles from the capital. This is the starting-point for
                        the ruins of Uxmal. We were nearly four hours on the way. A pair of brisk
                        trotters on a good road would have done it in the same time, but there are
                        neither brisk trotters nor good <pb n="153" id="VAA3906-158"/>roads in
                        Yucatan. Many of the villages we passed were very picturesque. The cabins
                        were oval in shape and had steep, high roofs thatched with long grass. The
                        sides were constructed of small poles placed close together, sometimes
                        plastered over and sometimes not. Each cabin had but one room, where all the
                        family lived, and we could see the groups before the doors arrayed in
                        costumes of more than Arcadian simplicity. A woman in a loose gown with a
                        water jug on her shoulder, standing at a well, might have served as a model
                        for &quot;Rebekah&quot; or &quot;The Woman of
                        Samaria.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The <foreign rend="i">fonda</foreign>, or tavern, at Ticul was very
                        primitive. Two or three bedrooms, destitute of furniture, except a chair or
                        two, a kitchen in the middle of the house where a few sticks burned upon the
                        bare ground, and a room in front, with a rough table for dining,-this was
                        all. We must provide our own beds. The first question when we asked for
                        accommodation was, &quot;Have you any hammocks?&quot; Luckily we had
                        brought them with us. So we were conducted to the only vacant room, totally
                        bare, opening upon the yard at the back of <pb n="154" id="VAA3906-159"/>
                        the house and permeated with evil smells. There were no windows. There were
                        four rings upon the wall for hammocks. My companions came back with this
                        information to the dining-room, where I was talking with the landlady. There
                        was only room, they said, for two hammocks; what was to be done? But we were
                        unsophisticated. She laughed as she showed us how all three could be hung
                        upon these four rings in the shape of the letter N. If there had been six of
                        us instead of three, she would have shown us how to hang them, some low and
                        others high, so as to accommodate all. Four rings will go a long way toward
                        providing sleeping quarters in Yucatan.</p>
                    <p>We ordered chickens and eggs and bread and oranges to take with us to Uxmal,
                        for at that place there are no accommodations. Probably we would have to
                        sleep in the ruins. Perhaps the <foreign rend="i">mayoral</foreign>, or
                        superintendent of the hacienda nearby, might ask us to stay all night with
                        him, but this was uncertain; for we bore no letters, and, at all events, we
                        must bring our own food with us. The landlady of the inn was to waken us at
                        four in the morning for the <pb n="155" id="VAA3906-160"/> start, but we had
                        learned from other travellers that we ourselves would have to arouse the
                        household. Indeed, this was not difficult, for there was no temptation to
                        sleep. Our overcoats made bad pillows, the odors were intolerable, the leas
                        were vicious, and after the first hour or two of broken slumber I could hear
                        the village clock strike one, two, three, and four; and at the last hour I
                        very willingly aroused everybody and insisted upon the immediate preparation
                        of the morning chocolate. The owner of the <foreign rend="i"
                        >volan</foreign>, or carriage, which was to take us to the ruins, was
                        already busy hitching his mules, and a little after five, in the bright
                        moonlight, we set out for Uxmal.</p>
                    <p>The road from Ticul to Uxmal is simply execrable. I measured some of the
                        rocks over which the volan jolted, and they were thirty inches high. The two
                        wheels of our vehicle were enormous, eight feet in diameter at least. The
                        small conveyance that was swung between them looked like a low-roofed
                        omnibus, but it had no floor. Ropes were stretched across the bottom in
                        checkerboard fashion and upon these a sort of mattress was spread. There
                        were no seats. If there were only two <pb n="156" id="VAA3906-161"/> persons
                        they could lie lengthwise upon the mattress and be reasonably comfortable.
                        If there were three or more, the passengers had to sit sandwiched, side by
                        side. There were three of us, and we found it most convenient for each man
                        to stick his feet out between the posts supporting the roof on the side
                        opposite the one where he sat. We were pitched backward and forward like
                        shuttlecocks as the vehicle jolted over the rocks. There were three mules
                        hitched to this conveyance, miserable-looking little beasts with the hair
                        rubbed off their skins, and in some places the skin itself rubbed off by the
                        rope traces. Yet they trotted along at a lively pace, especially where the
                        road was particularly rough.</p>
                    <p>On the way to Uxmal we passed two haciendas with large fields of henequin and
                        groups of laborers&apos; cabins around the large stone factory. Then we
                        crossed the <foreign rend="i">cerro</foreign>, a ridge of low rocky hills
                        which forms the backbone of Yucatan, and beyond this the rest of the
                        twenty-four miles to Uxmal was wilderness. Climbing the hill was slow work,
                        but on the way down the little Indian who drove the mules rushed over the
                        rocks at headlong seed. Branches <pb n="157" id="VAA3906-162"/> projected
                        from the small trees and bushes at each side, and we had to look out for
                        them as we passed. The Indian boy, who sat on a board in front and drove the
                        mules, had to do the same. Indeed, it was he who got the first smart cut
                        over the eye.</p>
                    <p>It was nearly midday when we came to the hacienda of Uxmal. The
                        superintendent told us that we were welcome to swing our hammocks in one of
                        his rooms for the night, provided us with a table in another apartment for
                        our meals, and gave us an Indian guide who accompanied us to the ruins, a
                        mile and a half away. The walk was intensely hot and uncomfortable. The
                        tropical sun beat upon us violently, and the small trees and bushes on each
                        side of the pathway afforded no protection.</p>
                    <p>Our Indian guide could tell us little about the ruins further than to show us
                        the way, but the admirable work written by Mr. Stephens nearly fifty years
                        ago gave us all the information which we needed. There was never a book of
                        travels more entertaining and accurate at the same time than that of Mr.
                        Stephens. His measurements and descriptions are exact, and when we compared
                        the ruins themselves with the <pb n="158" id="VAA3906-163"/> illustrations
                        of his work made by Mr. Catherwood, we found them as nearly perfect as
                        possible, considering the additional decay of the last fifty years. The
                        great bulk of the city of Uxmal is now destroyed, but the palaces and
                        temples which formed the Kremlin of this Moscow of the Maya people still
                        remain in a remarkable state of preservation. There are remnants of the old
                        walls still discernible, and the stately buildings which they inclose are
                        preserved almost intact.</p>
                    <p>We first entered the Casa de las Monjas, or Nuns&apos; House, a
                        collection of four long beautiful buildings surrounding an open square. Each
                        of these buildings is disconnected from the others, but they are close
                        together. We entered the square courtyard through a &quot;triangular
                        arch,&quot; as it is called, where the stone walls upon each side come
                        closer and closer together up to the apex, which is surmounted by a flat
                        stone. Except for this stone it is somewhat like the perpendicular Gothic
                        arch. There are a number of these triangular arches at Uxmal. In some of
                        them the sides are straight, in others they curve inward-like the genuine
                        Gothic arch-until they reach <pb n="159" id="VAA3906-164"/>this flat stone
                        at the top. The Maya people were evidently attempting to do something which
                        was finally accomplished in the Eastern hemisphere by medieval
                        architecture.</p>
                    <p>As we entered the great court of the Nuns&apos; House, we saw that the
                        long building on the south side through which we had just passed was lower
                        than the others. The loftiest structure was on the north in front of us. A
                        broad stairway (now in ruins) led up to it, flanked on each side by heavy
                        stonework. The noble building which faced us at the top of this stairway had
                        five front entrances. The walls were plain up to the cornice, but the
                        cornice itself was larger than the building below it, and was ornamented by
                        elaborate sculptures. The work was all done upon small blocks of stone. Over
                        each doorway there were grotesque heads, superimposed one above another, and
                        over three of the doors, the one at the centre and those at each end, these
                        ornaments extended upward in triangular shape. The remaining part of the
                        cornice was composed of geometrical figures, some of them quite similar to
                        the &quot;Wall of Troy.&quot;</p>
                    <pb n="160" id="VAA3906-165"/>
                    <p>On the east side of the courtyard was the most beautiful of all the buildings
                        of Uxmal, and it remains to-day in a remarkable state of preservation. Here
                        also there are five doorways, and above the central door are the same
                        grotesque figures. The rest of the cornice is composed of stone
                        lattice-work, and above each of the other doorways is an ornament of
                        remarkable beauty, consisting of eight horizontal bars, shorter at the
                        bottom, longer at the top, with a dragon&apos;s head at the end of each
                        bar, and a head with a head-dress remarkably like those in ancient Egyptian
                        sculptures, placed across the middle of the three upper bars.</p>
                    <p>The facade of this east building seems to be as perfect a specimen of its own
                        peculiar kind of architecture, as exquisite in design, and as well
                        proportioned as the courts of the Alhambra or the facade of the Palace of
                        the Doges. I do not intend to be an enthusiast as to these ruins. For
                        practical application to the uses of modern life they would be found
                        defective. In some of the buildings the ornaments are grotesque and
                        unsatisfactory. None of these structures is large enough to be impressive by
                        reason of <pb n="161" id="VAA3906-166"/> its mere size, nor airy and
                        delicate enough to attract us by reason of its mere airiness and delicacy,
                        but I affirm in respect to the structure which stands at the east side of
                        the courtyard of the Nuns&apos; House at Uxmal, that if the requirements
                        of modern life, whether for zoological garden, picture gallery, or other
                        purpose, should call for a building of this particular kind--long, low, and
                        with many entrances in front,-no modern architect could without plagiarism
                        produce its superior so far as relates to the proportions and general
                        decoration of the facade. Its unknown designer was one of the
                        world&apos;s great architects. Remnants of red paint were to be seen in
                        the holes of the lattice-work. The facade of this building (like the walls
                        of the courts in the Alhambra) was probably painted in brilliant colors in
                        past times.</p>
                    <p>The edifice on the west of the courtyard was mostly in ruins, although the
                        sculptures on the part which remained showed that it had been even more
                        elaborate. The broad cornice was divided into panels, and the forms of
                        serpents twined together surrounded each panel. The mouth of one of these
                        serpents had a human face in its jaws, <pb n="162" id="VAA3906-167"/> and
                        there was a long rattle on the tail of the other.</p>
                    <p>On the southern building there was also diamond lattice-work, and over each
                        door was a window with an ornament which seemed to represent a small house
                        with a thatched roof, and above the roof the grotesque face of some god or
                        monster.</p>
                    <p>After leaving the Nuns&apos; House, we visited the Casa de las Palomas,
                        the pigeon-house, so called from the gables perforated by windows, which
                        look like the front of pigeon-houses. These are, however, not the fronts of
                        houses at all. They form the backbone or comb of the series of buildings
                        below, and were built solely for the purpose of ornament. They remind one
                        much of a series of gabled houses in a Dutch town.</p>
                    <p>Behind the Casa de las Palomas is another courtyard, and beyond this a
                            <foreign rend="i">teocallis</foreign>, a high truncated pyramid, where
                        the sacrifices of human victims to the old Maya gods were performed with
                        great pomp and ceremony. Near this is the Casa de La Vieja, the
                        &quot;old woman&apos;s house,&quot; a pyramid nearly as high,
                        surmounted by a small stone building, upon which the stone figure of an old
                        woman was prominent.</p>
                    <pb n="163" id="VAA3906-168"/>
                    <p>The next building we visited was the Casa del Gobernador, supposed to be the
                        king&apos;s palace. It was more than four hundred feet long and was
                        placed upon the top of three terraces, aggregating some seventy feet in
                        height. The cornice of this building above the doorways was loaded down with
                        grotesque sculptures, and there were several triangular arches in the
                        facade. Here Stephens found upon the walls some fifty years ago the print of
                        small red hands, not painted, but an exact impression of human hands. One or
                        two specimens of these are still remaining. Our guide insisted that this was
                        done in blood, but evidently that could not be the case, since such an
                        impression would hardly outlast the centuries since Uxmal was abandoned.</p>
                    <p>Another edifice of great interest, although smaller in dimensions, is the
                        Diviner&apos;s House, perched on the top of a lofty pyramid, and reached
                        only by a steep and rather dangerous stone stairway. This is said to have
                        been the dwelling of the high-priest, although little is known, even by the
                        descendants of the people who built these structures, of the purpose for
                        which they were constructed.</p>
                    <pb n="164" id="VAA3906-169"/>
                    <p>During our examination of these buildings the heat was stifling, and the
                            <foreign rend="i">garrapatas</foreign> (minute insects, so small that a
                        single one can hardly be seen) would come in such numbers over our white
                        trousers as to require constant switching with a green bush to keep them
                        off. Our Maya guide, with his bare legs, had a harder time of it than we.
                        These little creatures are a great pest. They will burrow into the flesh and
                        cause much trouble if not removed. One of my companions wrote to me three
                        months afterward from Chicago that the <foreign rend="i"
                            >garrapatas</foreign> were still with him. I was more diligent with my
                        brush and had better fortune. Our guide removed them from his legs with a
                        piece of wax which he had brought for the purpose, and when any of them got
                        upon our hands the wax was equally convenient for us. We saw thousands of
                        these little creatures upon a single twig or leaf.</p>
                    <p>After visiting the ruins of Uxmal we remained one night at the hacienda. It
                        was dangerous to stay in this neighborhood too long. At the time when Uxmal
                        was a great city, the people, in order to provide water for the dry season,
                        had constructed <pb n="165" id="VAA3906-170"/> vast <foreign rend="i"
                            >aguadas</foreign>, or reservoirs with immense cisterns. After the land
                        became a wilderness, these reservoirs came to be the breeding houses of
                        pestilence, and the climate of Uxmal at the present time is deadly to the
                        stranger. Indeed, the hacienda in the neighborhood has been repeopled
                        several times, the original occupants having perished from the fever. We
                        inquired of the <foreign rend="i">mayoral</foreign> whether it was healthy
                        at the present time. He answered that the season was a very healthy one;
                        there were thirty people then in the hacienda, and only six of them were
                        down with the fever! We kept the doors of our rooms tightly closed during
                        the night.</p>
                    <p>On our return to Ticul the following morning an accident happened. We
                        encountered a heavily laden wagon drawn by six mules. The road was too
                        narrow for us to pass. There was a collision, and the axle of our volan was
                        so badly cracked that the vehicle threatened to go to pieces at any moment,
                        so we thought it best to ride no farther. The nearest hacienda was six miles
                        away. If we could walk that far perhaps we could find another conveyance to
                        Ticul--&quot;who knows?&quot; We started on foot and the Indian boy
                        kept his place in <pb n="166" id="VAA3906-171"/> volan till it should break
                        down. We had greater powers of endurance than we thought. The terrible sun
                        hid his rays behind light clouds most of the time, the volan climbed and
                        descended the ridge in safety, and we all reached the hacienda of San Josh
                        in fair condition. But there was no other vehicle to be had. We must go on
                        ten miles farther to Ticul.</p>
                    <p>When we had gone a little more than half that distance, three other vehicles
                        like our own passed us upon the road. One of these stopped and a voice from
                        the inside asked us in broken English if we had had an accident. We
                        explained what had happened, and our unknown friend insisted that we should
                        take his volan. He and his companions would get out and wait, and the driver
                        would return for them. This was certainly a hospitable act to strangers. We
                        thanked him, but declined.</p>
                    <p>The road was monotonous, but not devoid of interest. Upon the ridge of the
                        low hill on the right we could see great cacti growing higher than the
                        trees, and as we approached the village the henequin fields began again, and
                        then the palms and the verdure and white-plastered cabins.</p>
                    <pb n="167" id="VAA3906-172"/>
                    <p>We were hungry as wolves when we reached the <foreign rend="i"
                            >fonda</foreign>, but luckily a gourd which we had filled at Uxmal had
                        furnished us with water on the way, besides a little to spare once in a
                        while for our hot axle. Our hostess at the tavern gave us a wretched meal,
                        which, however, tasted as if it had come from paradise; and after an
                        evening&apos;s stroll through the town we swung our hammocks upon the
                        rings in the walls of our bare room and tried to sleep. We began to now
                        understand the manifold reasons suggested by the fan merchant in Havana why
                        this was impossible. I was glad enough after once more counting the hours to
                        hear the clock strike five, when I was to awaken the household. They gave us
                        our morning chocolate and we started for the train to Merida.</p>
                    <p>The scene at the station was curious. Some wild steers had to be driven into
                        one of the cars. They had been lassoed, but it was no easy work to bring
                        them to the platform and put them on board. They plunged and rushed in every
                        direction, and great shouts went up from the crowd as one after another of
                        the men in charge had to dodge and run. It was almost as fine <pb n="168"
                            id="VAA3906-173"/> sport as a bullfight. When we reached Merida a bath
                        was the first necessity, and then a &quot;square meal,&quot; the
                        first for three days.</p>
                    <p>On the following morning we betook ourselves to Progreso to take the steamer
                        for Vera Cruz, but a &quot;Norte&quot; was blowing, and although the
                            <foreign rend="i">Yurmuri</foreign> was lying in the roadstead there was
                        no communication with the shore, so we returned to Merida by the afternoon
                        train. The hotel at Progreso was insufferable. Pigeons and other birds
                        perched upon the rafters of the room where we breakfasted, and the bad odors
                        of the place, moral as well as material, drove us away. Next morning we came
                        back again, and after some hours of waiting on the long pier the tug brought
                        us out to the steamer, which had to remain there still another day to unload
                        a cargo which the lighters would not take until the
                        &quot;Norther&quot; had subsided. There was a company of jovial
                        passengers on board, among them an Irish priest, who insisted that the Greek
                        language boasted of an ablative, and who gave us much startling information
                        on other matters from a characteristically Celtic point of view. After we
                        started, another <pb n="169" id="VAA3906-174"/> &quot;Norther&quot;
                        came, and as a contortionist the <foreign rend="i">Yurmusi</foreign> was not
                        to be outdone. She rolled magnificently. Sometimes the ladies were hurled
                        from one side of the cabin to the other, then they would tumble to the floor
                        together and slide from side to side amid shrieks of laughter, while others
                        embraced the posts and handrails with desperate tenacity. Next morning,
                        however, the storm subsided and we entered the port of Vera Cruz.</p>

                    <head type="center">ON WILLIAM PENN AND HIS MISSION</head>
                    <p>WHAT part did William Penn and those who settled Pennsylvania play in the
                        world&apos;s history? We are far enough away from the scene of these
                        events to judge with some impartiality, yet opinions are still widely
                        divergent. On the one hand, he is considered an apostle of light, the
                        forerunner of a new civilization; on the other, he is described by Macaulay
                        as a coutier and a sycophant, a supporer of the tyrnny of James II., and a
                        participant in several questionable transactions.</p>
                    <p>The colony he established in Pennsylvania has been regarded as the first
                        example of a new society in which the brotherhood of man was established
                        upon principles of justice and fair dealing, and on the other hand this
                        colony has been described by Parkman as a community in which patriotism was
                        frittered away in internal dissen- <pb n="171" id="VAA3906-176"/> sions, and
                        in which the duty to give loyal support to the neighboring colonies in their
                        life-and-death struggle with the French and Indians was neglected at the
                        dictates of unworthy selfishness and maudlin philanthropy. The truth lies
                        somewhere between these extravagant estimates.</p>
                    <p>No one ought to doubt the sincerity and the pure purposes of William Penn. He
                        proved them by a life of sacrifice and self denial. The son of an eminent
                        admiral, he cast aside the allurements of station, and was content, for the
                        sake of his faith, to take his lot among the followers of an humble and
                        persecuted sect. For this he was driven from his father&apos;s house,
                        was exposed to general obloquy, and repeatedly suffred imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>William Penn and the Commonwealth which he established were a fair type of
                        Quakerism-of its self-renunciation, honesty, fair dealing, religious
                        tolerance, and love of peace, but also of the essential weakness of its
                        principle of non-resistance. It has been a Commonwealth, industrious,
                        prosperous, liberal in institutions yet conservative in sediment, adapted to
                        every exigency except war, and to the <pb n="172" id="VAA3906-177"
                        />development of all virtues except those stern and rugged qualities which
                        strife engenders.</p>
                    <p>Although the doctrines of Quakerism mark a step in the world&apos;s
                        progress, they are not the embodiment of final truth. Like other sects,
                        Qakerism represents a phase in the progressive development of the religious
                        thought of civilization. It is not the last word which civilization has to
                        utter. Nor were the early Friends, however great their devotion, to what
                        they considered the Inner Light,&quot; entirely consistent either in
                        belief or practice. They rejected titles, they would not offer words of
                        compliment, and William Penn braved the contempt of the word and endured
                        exile from his father&apos;s house because he would not take off his hat
                        to his father nor his king. And yet the man who refused this act of
                        reverence wrote, in 1764, to the Duke of York a letter regarding the
                        boundaries of Pennsylvania, which began as follows: <q type="blockquote"

                            resolution; one that will not be <pb n="173" id="VAA3906-178"/> baffled
                            by crafts nor blinded by affection; and such a prince, with humility be
                            it spoken, becometh the just cause I have to lay befoe
                            him.&quot;</q></p>
                    <p>These words were addressed to James II., and it must be confessed that there
                        is something of the instinct of the courtier cropping out through the plain
                        language of the Quaker.</p>
                    <p>William Penn and the Society he represented were tolerant of the religious
                        beliefs of others, yet this toleration had its limits, for, according to the
                        &quot;Frame of Government&quot; which he established for
                        Pennsylvania, members of the Council and Assembly and all judges were to be
                        such only as profssed faith in Jesus Christ. The Jew could hold no office.
                        It was further provided that all persons who confssed one Almighty God to be
                        the Creator, Upholder, and Ruler of the world, and held themselves pledged
                        to live peaceably and justly in civil sociey, should in no wise be molested
                        on account of their persuasion or practice in matters of faith. This would
                        exclude the Brahmin, the Buddhist, the agnostic. The limits of toleration
                        were wide, but the walls were there.</p>
                    <p>William Penn was willing to grant equal <pb n="174" id="VAA3906-179"/> rights
                        to all his Anglo-Saxon colonists, but William Penn held negro slaves.</p>
                    <p>The colony of Pennsylvania represented the temperance and sobriety of a
                        God-fearing sect, yet we hear of the sale of liquor to the Indians, until
                        the scandal led to a law providing that no rum should be &quot;sold to
                        any but the chiefs, and in such quantities as the Governor and Council
                        should think fit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>These inconsistencies are by no means evidences of insincerity, but they are
                        simply evidences that the standard set by Friends was such that it could not
                        be consistently carried out, even by those of the best intentions.</p>
                    <p>This is still more evident when we come to the doctrine of non-resistance.
                        Government itself means force. If force were never necessary, government
                        would be unnecessary. All social functons could be peformed by voluntary
                        co-operation. But there are delinquents who will not do their part. There
                        are criminals who break the rules necessary to social peace, who commit
                        murder, robber, and other acts of violence and fraud. These things must be
                        repressed, without force if possible, but <pb n="175" id="VAA3906-180"/>
                        with force if necessary. Hence the law, the judge, the jailor, the
                        sheriff&apos;s posse, and the army. If force may be necessary, the
                        utmost force is sometimes indispensable, even to the taking of life. This
                        force, in the last analysis, means war. Hence, that the doctrine of
                        non-resistance should be applied at all times, under all circumstances, by
                        the head of the civil government, is not practicable. William Penn himself
                        seemed to acknowledge this embarrassment, for in the year 1700, when a riot
                        occurred in East Jersey, he wrote a letter to his friends in that government
                        to show the course he would pursue. In this leter he said <q
                            type="blockquote">&apos;he knew not what punishment these rioters
                            did not deserve, and he woud rather live alone than not have such people
                            corrigible. Their leaders should be eyed and some shoud be forced to
                            declare them by the rigor of the law, and those who were found to be
                            such should bear the burthen of sedition, which would be the best way to
                            behead the body without danger. If lenitives would not do, coercives
                            should be tried; but though men naturally begin with the former, yet
                            wisdom had often sanctioned the latter as remedies, which, however, were
                            never to be adopted without regret&apos;.</q> But to put down a riot
                        by force and to put down a grat rebellion by arms differ only <pb n="176"
                            id="VAA3906-181"/> in degree. Moreover, Penn in accepting his charter
                        from the king accepted in it the powers of a captain-general to levy,
                        muster, and train man to make war upon barbarous natives, pirates, and
                        robbers.</p>
                    <p>In 1701 the king required a contribution of 350 pounds sterling toward
                        erecting forts on the frontiers of New York, and William Penn convened the
                        Assembly to lay before them the king&apos;s letter. He recommended it to
                        their serious consideration, but abstained from expressing any views in
                        regard to it. In answer, they declined to comply, and postponed the matter
                        to the next Assembly. Penn apparently desired the contribution to be made,
                        for at the next Assembly he wrote again recommending it to their serious
                        thought and care.</p>
                    <p>But, however impossible the maintenance of peace may be under extreme
                        conditions, the government established by William Penn shows how admirably
                        fair dealing will accomplish it under ordinary circumstances. To me the most
                        beneficent feature of his government is the inculcation of the spirit of
                        fairness. Within a month from the date of the charter granted to <pb n="177"
                            id="VAA3906-182"/> Penn, he thus wrote to the inhabitans of
                        Pennsylvania: &quot;You shall be governed by laws of your own making and
                        left a free, and, if you will, a sober and industrious people. I shall not
                        usurp the right of any or oppress his person.&quot; And again, on April
                        12, 1661, to friends in England: &quot;For the matters of liberty and
                        privilege I propose that which is extraordinary, and to leave myself and
                        successors no power of doing mischief, that the will of one man may not
                        hinder the good of the whole country.&quot; In the history of
                        Pennsylvania, there never appeared upon the part of Penn any desire to
                        maintain his own prerogative or to usurp any powers or privileges against
                        the wish of the people, but, on the other hand, always a willingness to make
                        additional concessions and to regulate the affairs of the colony in the
                        manner the people desired. He relinquished duties and taxes that had been
                        allowed him, and carried his generosity to such an extent as seriously to
                        cripple his fotune.</p>
                    <p>He also insisted upon fair treatment fro others for those whom he
                        represented. This is shown in a Remonstance to the Duke of York by the
                        Trustees of West <pb n="178" id="VAA3906-183"/> Jersey, probably written by
                        Penn, against the exaction of a duty on imports and exports. This
                        remonstrance shows that the powers of government were granted to the
                        Trustees, and that the power of taxation claimed by the Duke&apos;s
                        agents was a violation of English liberty. He foreshadows the future
                        doctrine of the colonies, &quot;that taxation without representation was
                        tyranny,&quot; in these words: &quot;Since we are by this precedent
                        assessed without any law and thereby excluded our English right of
                        consenting to taxes, what security have we of anything which we
                        possess?&quot; The remonstrance was effectual and the duty was
                        remitted.</p>
                    <p>Nowhere did Penn&apos;s fairness appear more manifest than in his
                        treatment of the natives. He not only bought their land for a fair price,
                        but established careful regulations for dealing with them. Goods sold or
                        exchanged with them were to be exhibited in open market, that imposition
                        might be prevented. No colonist was allowed to affront or wrong an Indian
                        without incurring the same penalty as if the offence were committed against
                        his fellow planter. Differences between the Indians and colonists <pb
                            n="179" id="VAA3906-184"/> were to be settled by a jury of twelve men,
                        six of whom were to be Indians.</p>
                    <p>In a letter to Robert Turner he says: <q type="blockquote">&quot;I did
                            refuse a great temptation last Second-day, which was 6,000 pounds to pay
                            the Indians for six shares and make the purchasers a company to have
                            wholy to itself the Indian trade from North to South between the
                            Susquehanna and Delaware rivers, paying 2 1/2 per cent acknowledgment or
                            rent. But as the Lord gave it me over all and great opposition, and that
                            I never had my mind so exercised to the Lord about my outward subtance,
                            I would not abuse His love nor act unworthy of His providence and so
                            defile what came to me clean.&quot;</q></p>
                    <p>The most conspicuous example of his fair dealing was that celebrated treaty
                        with the Indians of which Voltaire said that it was the only league between
                        those nations and the Christians which was never sworn to and never broken.
                        The terms of this treaty were wholly free from that claim of superiority
                        which so generally marks the dealings of white men with Indians. Both the
                        contracting parties were put upon a plane of absolute equality. All paths
                        were to be free to both Christians and Indians. The doors of Christian
                        houses were open to the Indians, and the houses of the Indians open to the
                        Christians. Neither were to believe false <pb n="180" id="VAA3906-185"/>
                        rumors of each other without coming first as brethren to inquire. Neither
                        party was to harm the other, but, as there were wicked people in all
                        nations, if any harm was done complaint was to be made, and when satisfied
                        the injury was to be forgotten. Each was to assist the other against all
                        disturbance, and the children of both were to be acquainted with the league,
                        that it might be made stronger and stronger, without rust or spot, between
                        their children and children&apos;s children, while the creeks and rivers
                        run and while the sun, moon, and stars should endure.</p>
                    <p>Under the provisions of this treaty, the colony of Pennsylvania remained free
                        from the devastation of Indian warfare until after the outbreak of the
                        French and Indian War-a period long after the death of those who had taken
                        part in the treaty. And this war was brought upon the colony by the
                        controversion of others, and not by the successors of those who had made the
                        compact.</p>
                    <p>Another evidence of the justice, liberality, and generosity of the
                        institutions established by Penn is found in the fact that when he received
                        the grant to Penn- <pb n="181" id="VAA3906-186"/> sylvania from the king he
                        made no attempt to gain any advantage over those who had already settled
                        within the territory ceded to him. He gave equal rights to the Swedes and
                        the Dutch, as well as to Englishmen who were already there. And when the War
                        of the Revolution broke out, Pennsylvania was found to be composed of a more
                        heterogeneous class of population, differing more widely from each other in
                        race, institutions, and faith, than any other of the thirteen colonies.</p>
                    <p>Among the companions of Penn at Oxford was the philosopher Locke, who drafted
                        a constitution for the Carolinas, which may profitably be compared with the
                        government established by Penn. Locke created an order of nobility. Penn
                        abolished the laws of primogeniture. According to Locke, none but land
                        proprietors were eligible to the Legislature. Penn provided for annual
                        elections by the whole peo- ple. <q type="blockquote">&quot;To the
                            charter,&quot; says Bancroft, &quot;which Locke invented for
                            Carolina, the Palatines voted an immutable immortality; and it never
                            gained more than a short and partial existence. To the people of his
                            province Penn left it free to subvert or alter the &apos;Frame of
                            Government;&apos; and its essential principles remain to this
                            day.&quot;</q></p>
                    <pb n="182" id="VAA3906-187"/>
                    <p>It can hardly be denied that much of the superiority of Penn&apos;s
                        government must be accorded to the influence of his religious associations,
                        and to his fellowship with a sect which acknowledged no distinction of
                        clergy and laity and placed a low estimate on hereditary rank. His
                        democratic tendencies appear in the preface to his &quot;Frame of
                        Government,&quot; where be says: <q type="blockquote">&quot;know
                            what is said by the several admirers of monarchy, aristocracy, and
                            democracy, which are the rule of one, of a few, and of many, and are the
                            three common ideas of government when men discourse on that subject. But
                            I choose to solve the controversy with this small distinction, and it
                            belongs to all three. Any government is free to the people under it,
                            whatever be the frame, where the laws rule and the people are party to
                            these laws. And more than this is tyranny, oligarchy, or confusion. But
                            lastly, when all is said, there is hardly one frame of government in the
                            world so illy designed by its first founders that in good hands would
                            not be well enough. History tells us that the best in ill ones can do
                            nothing that is great and good; witness the Jewishand Roman States.
                            Governments like clocks go from the motion men give them, and as
                            governments are made to move by men, so by them are they ruined too.
                            Wherefore governments rather depend upon men than men upon governments.
                            Let men be good and the government cannot be bad. If it be ill, they
                            will cure it. But if men be bad, let the government beever so good, they
                            will endeavor to warp and spoil it to their turn.&quot;</q></p>
                    <pb n="183" id="VAA3906-188"/>
                    <p>The institutions established by Penn were certainly more crude than those
                        prevailing to-day. They did not distinguish so early between legislative,
                        administrative, and judicial functions. The freemen were to choose
                        seventy-two members of the Provincial Council, over which the Governor or
                        his deputy was to preside and have a treble vote. All bills were to be
                        prepared by the governor and council and published thirty days before the
                        meeting of the Assembly. The governor and council managed the treasury, saw
                        to the execution of the laws, and acted as a court of appeals. The general
                        assembly was composed of two hundred persons, chosen annually. The powers of
                        this assembly were quite limited. It could propose no law, but at the end of
                        the eight days of deliberation it voted yea or nay upon all the laws
                        proposed by the council. This was practically little more than a veto. In
                        later times we have reversed this order. The Legislature passes the law and
                        the Executive has a limited veto power.</p>
                    <p>The qualifications for suffrage were extremely liberal for that age. Not only
                        all land-holders, but every inhabitant who <pb n="184" id="VAA3906-189"/>
                        paid &quot;scot and lot&quot; to the government, might vote. No
                        taxes were to be collected but by law. In court all persons might appear in
                        their own way, and plead their own case. Al trials were to be by jury. No
                        oaths were to be required. All fines were to be moderate; all prisons to be
                        work-houses. All marriages were to be published and solemnized by the
                        parties taking one another as husband and wife before witnesses. The estates
                        of felons must make satisfaction to the family wronged to twice the value,
                        and in default the felons were to be bondsmen until the party injured was
                        satisfied. Slanderers were to be punished as enemies of the public
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>The sanguinary criminal code of England was abolished, and the penalty of
                        death was reserved for wilful murder only. But even in this provision it is
                        evident that the practical mind of William Penn realized that the
                        non-resistant principles of Friends could not be fully applied.</p>
                    <p>The first inroads made upon Penn&apos;s government found its weak point,
                        as might be expected, in the theory of non-resistance. There were pirates
                        upon the seas, and enemies of England and the colonies <pb n="185"
                            id="VAA3906-190"/> both on sea and shore. Every other colony erected
                        fortifications and raised troops. Pennsylvania alone was undefended. So fair
                        had been the conduct of the colonists that it was believed no defences would
                        be necessary. Yet in a world where the doctrine that might makes right is so
                        generally acted upon, the time comes sooner or later when defences are
                        necessary. This occurred in Pennsylvania at the time of the French and
                        Indian War. The French had won most of the native tribes to their alliance;
                        the British regulars, under Braddock, in their expedition against Fort
                        Duquesne, within the limits of Pennsylvania, had encountered a disastrous
                        and overwhelming defeat, and the frontiers were laid open to the torch and
                        the tomahawk. William Penn had been long in his grave. His heirs had not
                        shown a generous and disinterested disposition toward the colonists. A
                        demand was made by the frontiersmen, mainly Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, for
                        protection against the Indias, but instead of according this protection by a
                        generous contribution of funds and by the organization of an efficient
                        militia, the inhabitants of the colony seized the <pb n="186"
                            id="VAA3906-191"/> occasion to contest their rights with the
                        proprietors, the heirs of William Penn. They were willing to levy a tax, but
                        it must be collected on the real estate of the colony, and the land of the
                        proprietors must be taxed like other land. They refused any aid except upon
                        this condition. The governor did not care to accede to it, and the result
                        was that the border settlements were left exposed to the devastation and
                        cruelties of Indian warfare, and several thousands of the settlers perished
                        by fire and sword. The frontiersmen, in their resentment at the outrages of
                        the Indians, had themselves committed outrages no less barbarous and
                        unjustifiable, and in their rage against the Quaker government at
                        Philadelphia they marched upon that city. The people, including many of the
                        Society of Friends, armed for their own defence, and there was seen the
                        spectacle, unknown until that time, of the broad-brim carrying the musket.
                        An actual collision was averted, yet the reputation of Pennsylvania suffered
                        greatly in the contest.</p>
                    <p>The colony was also reluctant to take part in the War of Independence, and
                            <pb n="187" id="VAA3906-192"/> although the immortal Declaration was
                        signed upon the soil of Pennsylvania, yet Pennsylvania was among the last of
                        the colonies which consented to the final step.</p>
                    <p>In the Civil War manys members of the Society of Friends found it impossible
                        to reconcile the peace principles of the Society with their duty to maintain
                        and uphold the Federal Government, and some took up arms for the maintenance
                        of the Union.</p>
                    <p>All these things show the impossibility of carrying out the doctrine of
                        non-resistance to its logical conclusion. But there is another objection to
                        that doctrine more vital than the impossibility of applying it in extreme
                        cases. It naturally begets the willingness and finally the disposition to
                        yield, and that disposition inevitably weakens the moral fibre of him who
                        possesses it.</p>
                    <p>It was the struggle for existence which led to the survival in organic life
                        of the swiftest wing, the sharpest talon, the keenest intellect, the most
                        resolute will; and the permanent absence of all strife is bound to lead to
                        the deterioration of those qualities upon which depend the progress and
                        advancement of the race. Physical <pb n="188" id="VAA3906-193"/> resistance
                        indeed is only one form of this struggle, but the community which forever
                        avoids it will be less likely, in the end, to make that moral resistance
                        which is necessary for the preservation of its integrity. Pennsylvania has
                        of late years suffered greatly from a political corruption which could not
                        have made such serious inroads if the really good people of the Commonwealth
                        had been more belligerent and more stubborn in resistance. But these good
                        people, by constant yielding, or perhaps by abstaining from participation in
                        political controversies at all, have made the work of their plunderers easy
                        and successful.</p>
                    <p>All honor, then, to the pure motives, the spirit of fairness and kind dealing
                        which characterized the career of William Penn and his associates; but let
                        us be careful not to put too much faith in the peace principles inculcated
                        by the religious society of which he was so eminent a member.</p>

                    <head rend="center">AN EXPERT IN SCALPING</head>
                    <p>IN 1870 the Indian tribes in Nebraska and Kansas were under the charge of the
                        Society of Friends, and President Grant had appointed as superintendent of
                        the district the venerable Samuel M. Janney, an eminent minister of that
                        Society. There had been some trouble with the Winnebagoes. A party of young
                        braves had just scalped a man west of the reservation, a farmer by the name
                        of McMurdy, and on their return a number of scalp dances and other
                        festivities had been held in honor of the event. There were thirteen bands
                        of these Winnebagoes, each with its hereditary chief. A number of these
                        chiefs had taken a leading part in the festivities, and the agent had made
                        up his mind that something ought to be done. He adopted the rather daring
                        expedient of turning out the chiefs who had offended, and appointing others
                        in their <pb n="190" id="VAA3906-195"/> places, whom he would recognize in
                        the distribution of government rations and supplies. Naturally, the men who
                        were superseded resented this interference, and denied the right of the
                        agent to depose them. But he was infexible, and a council of the tribe was
                        called, at which he proposed to announce the changes.</p>
                    <p>General Auger, on learning of the trouble, had offered to Mr. Janney to send
                        some soldiers to protect the agent in case of an uprising. But the
                        superintendent objected, since he wanted to manage the Indians according to
                        the peace principles of the Makers. He asked my father and me to go up to
                        the Winnebago reservation, to &quot;strengthen the hands of the
                        agent,&quot; as he called it.</p>
                    <p>There were about fifteen hundred Indians on the reservation, and hardly a
                        score of white men. The chiefs and the warriors came to the council fully
                        armed, a thing then quite unusual in that tribe, although common enough in
                        others. The agent made a speech, telling them that he would no longer
                        recognize the chiefs who had taken part in the scalp dances, or who had in
                        other ways encouraged or approved the <pb n="191" id="VAA3906-196"/> murder
                        of McMurdy. He read the names of the new men whom he had decided to appoint,
                        and told them to take the front seats which had been occupied by their
                        predecessors.</p>
                    <p>Then the trouble began. The old chiefs got up one after another, and
                        delivered violent harangues, amid great applause on the part of their
                        followers. The leading spirit was Grey Wolf, a smooth-faced, light-colored
                        Indian, with rows of beautiful white teeth, which when he opened his mouth
                        made him look as if he were going to chew up somebody. His face grew fairly
                        livid with rage. He was insolent and abusive. He declared that he had held
                        his place by virtue of the laws and customs of his tribe, and that the agent
                        had no right to turn him out; and he added (a dark-colored Indian named
                        Alexander interpreting his harangue): &quot;I will give you a piece of
                        advice. Get on your pony and get away from here as quickly as you can. It is
                        not good for you to stay.&quot; At every violent utterance the Indians,
                        who were squatted about the lodge, ejaculated &quot;How! How!&quot;
                        with great fire and fervor. As soon as Grey Wolf ended, he rushed
                        out-of-doors, followed by perhaps a dozen <pb n="192" id="VAA3906-197"/> of
                        his warriors. A horse named Buttermilk, belonging to the agent, was tied to
                        a tree near-by. Grey Wolf untied him, slipped off the saddle, jumped on his
                        back, and started on a full run through the village, yelling the war-whoop,
                        and followed on foot by the men who had gone out with him. The squaws came
                        out of their tepees and began to scream. We could hear the uproar inside of
                        the lodge, and there was great confusion. It seemed to me that something
                        ought to be done to quiet the disturbance, so I got up and made a speech.
                        Fortunately the Indians who were in the lodge stopped to listen, and a few
                        of the new chiefs and their friends began to &quot;How! How!&quot;
                        in their turn. Then one of the men who had just been appointed made a
                        conciliatory speech, but it was received with grunts of disapproval. Finally
                        Big Bear, an old Indian with an eye gouged out, came up to the small table
                        behind which we sat and began a harangue more violent even than that of Grey
                        Wolf. He was greeted with yells of applause. Suddenly I saw the Indians
                        looking through a window on one side of the lodge, and then all rose and
                        rushed in confusion to the door. A white <pb n="193" id="VAA3906-198"/> man
                        was standing outside. I asked him, &quot;What does it mean?&quot; He
                        answered, &quot;United States soldiers.&quot; A small detachment had
                        been sent by General Auger from Omaha, in spite of Mr. Janney&apos;s
                        remonstrance. There were not many troops, but just enough to overawe the
                        Indians and convince them that there were more behind. Grey Wolf came back
                        with the pony, and there was nothing more heard of but peace and good-will.
                        Yet I have always had very grave doubts whether, if General Auger&apos;s
                        men had not come, the principles of the Society of Friends would have
                        answered in that emergency.</p>
                    <p>The following winter five Indians were arrested and indicted for the murder
                        of McMurdy. Mr. Janney wanted them to have a fair trial, so Mr. A. J.
                        Poppleton, one of the leading lawyers in Nebraska, was employed to defend
                        them. I was then a law student, and had just been admitted to the bar. Mr.
                        Janney asked me to come out and help in the defence. Of course there was no
                        fee paid to me, but this was a good chance to try my hand. It was my first
                        trial, and was greatly in earnest.</p>
                    <p>It was an interesting case. The trial was <pb n="194" id="VAA3906-199"/> held
                        in the little town of Tekamah, at that time a village of perhaps a dozen log
                        houses. These houses were all of one story, except the
                        &quot;hotel&quot; and the country store. Nearly everybody connected
                        with the trial had to go to the little hotel-judge, jury, witnesses,
                        sheriff, and the prisoners in their chains. Mr. Poppleton and I had the only
                        private quarters; everybody else seemed to herd together, except thejudge,
                        who stayed elsewhere. The court was held in the attic of the store. You had
                        to go up by a little wooden stairway at the outside. There was only one
                        chair in the room, a wooden arm-chair covered with the American flag and
                        occupied by his Honor. The tables were made of rough boards. The counsel sat
                        upon soap-boxes turned up on one end. The jury sat on a board against the
                        wall. Everybody else either stood up or sat on the floor.</p>
                    <p>The Indians, both prisoners and witnesses, squatted upon the floor. We had a
                        hard time to get a jury. Whenever the panel was exhausted, the sheriff would
                        look out of one of the windows. There were two of them, one in each gable.
                        He could see a long way <pb n="195" id="VAA3906-200"/> across the plains,
                        and perhaps would spy a man a mile or so off, walking across his fields or
                        gathering fodder. &quot;Bring that man here!&quot; he would say to
                        the bailiff, who thereupon tore across the country and returned with his
                        captive, who would vainly endeavor to get excused from service upon a jury
                        that might involve some little danger to himself and was likely to take a
                        great deal of his time. After two or three days the panel was filled and the
                        trial began.</p>
                    <p>The evidence was circumstantial. The five prisoners were seen the day before
                        the murder, west of the reservation, walking in the direction of
                        McMurdy&apos;s farm, but they were several miles away.
                        McMurdy&apos;s body was found in a field near his plough. His head had
                        been cut off and thrown into a badger hole, and the entire scalp had been
                        removed. Three pieces of scalp were found in the tepees of three of the
                        prisoners. Each piece was stretched and fastened by thongs to a willow
                        withe, and painted red on the under side. One of these pieces was identified
                        by the mother of McMurdy, by a scar, as being part of the scalp of her son.
                        The five prisoners had returned together to the reservation, each with a
                        white feather <pb n="196" id="VAA3906-201"/> in his hair, the end of the
                        feather being dipped in blood. Then Grey Wolf was called as a witness to
                        show what this meant. His testimony was interpreted by Alexander. It meant,
                        he said, that the men who wore that feather had become braves.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did they become braves?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot; By scalping a man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you know? Did you ever scalp anybody?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot; How many?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Seven.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who were they?&quot;</p>
                    <p>And Grey Wolf named them all, giving the time and the occasion.</p>
                    <p>There has been much controversy as to the proper scope and value of expert
                        testimony. We have experts in medicine, in law, in the physical sciences, in
                        bookkeeping, in chirography, and in many other things; but I doubt whether
                        the history of jurisprudence can offer any other instance in which a man was
                        examined and his testimony received by the Court as an expert in scalping.
                        In giving scientific evidence upon this peculiar art Grey Wolf stands
                        alone.</p>

                    <p>The prisoners were convicted, but the jury evidently compromised in their
                        verdict. They considered, rather illogically, as juries do, that there was
                        doubt enough in the evidence to prevent the application of the death
                        penalty, and they prescribed the punishment of imprisonment for life, as
                        they had a right to do under the law of Nebraska. One or two of the Indians
                        were afterwards pardoned, and the others died in prison.</p>

                    etc.<lb/> 12. Illustrated. $1.25</head>
                <p>A tale of love and adventure in which the scenes are laid amid the abodes of that
                    wonderful people whose ruined cities are to-day the noblest monuments of
                    aboriginal art. The period is that of the Spanish invasion, and the Maya prices,
                    who is the chief feature of the story, will hardly fail to awaken in the mind of
                    the reader a warm feeling of sympathy and admiration.</p>
                <p>The author has been a traveller in Yucatan, familiar with the scenes he
                    describes, and the events which form the background or setting of his romance
                    are narrated with historical accuracy.</p>
                <p>&quot;Mr. Foulke has combined history with romance in a very sucessful way,
                    and his story will be read with profit as well as with pleasure. The volume has
                    some charming illustrations.&quot; -Glasgow Herald</p>
