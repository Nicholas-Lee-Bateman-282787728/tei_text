            <p>UNDER this heading I want to present a few considerations of a rather general
                    character brought home to me casually during work involving some incidental
                    study of State constitutions, chiefly in the old Northwest Territory.</p>
            <p>I was at the outset rather pleasantly surprised to find these constitutions an
                    interesting study. Ambassador Bryce, in his American Commonwealth, long ago
                    (1888) observed (Chap. XXXVII., Vol. II., p. 434) that "the State
                    constitutions furnish invaluable materials for history. Their interest is all
                    the greater because the succession of constitutions and amendments to
                    constitutions from 1776 till to-day enables the annals of legislation and
                    political sentiment to be read in these documents more easily and succinctly
                    than in any similar series of laws in any other country. They are a mine of
                    instruction for the natural history of democratic communities. Their fullness
                    and minutenew make them, so to speak, more pictorial than the Federal
                    Constitution. They tell us more about the actual methods and conduct of the
                    government than it does."</p>
            <p>There is not only interest, there is room for humor, also, in the study of the
                    State constitutions. Mr. Bryce finds our State constitutions surprising in
                    places; he exhibits many provisions, especially in the bills of rights, as
                    objects of curiosity, and occasionally jokes at them, as in the observation that
                    "twenty-six States declare that ‘all men have a natural,
                    inherent and inalienable right to enjoy and defend life and liberty, and all of
                    these except the melancholy <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, add, the natural right to pursue happiness.’"
                    (Chap. XXXVII, Vol. II, p. 424.) He refers to <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-007-2-002"/> them as "documents whose clauses, while they attempt to solve the
                    latest problems of democratic commonwealths, often recall the earliest efforts
                    of our English forefathers to restrain the excesses of medieval
                    tyranny." (Chap. XXXVIII, Vol. II, p 412).</p>
            <p>Other things besides Mr. Bryce's amused complacency throw a cheerful ray
                    across the path of the student of State constitutions. The innovations in at
                    least nine new State constitutions cause Eastern writers to make the most
                    mournful and pessimistic comparisons with the time-honored <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> instrument. Professer Stimson, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, in his very convenient compilation of "The Law
                    of the Federal and State Constitutions of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>" (1908), deplores the inaccessibility of State
                    constitutions. "In <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> it is not procurable. * * * Some
                    States like <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> do not print them at all with their general laws. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> and other States entirely omit constitutional amendments, while
                    hardly any State follows the example of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> in printing the constitution in its correct form every year.
                    * * * While the usual compilation of the laws
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and the official compilation of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and several other States commit the last inanity of printing the
                    State Constitution alphabetically under C, as if it were an ordinary
                    law" (p. XXI.) His exasperation finally reaches the height of
                    exclamation points. "Owing to the negligence or stupidity of the State
                    authorities in not printing these [amendments] with the annual laws, this [a
                    complete list of constitutional amendments] is a difficult matter to ascertain.
                    In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>, indeed, where laws and constitutional amendments are adopted by
                    popular initiative, the Secretary of State complains that they are
                    ‘full of bad spelling, punctuation, omissions and repeated
                    words’!" (p. 123).</p>
            <p>There are many things to tax one's patience in the study of the
                    (approximately) 125 State constitutions in force at one time or another since
                    1776. For instance, the official and supposedly complete collection of State
                    constitutions in F. N. Thorpe's American Charters, Constitutions and
                    Organic Laws (otherwise entitled Federal and State Constitutions) published by
                    the Government Printing Office, in the section devoted to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> omits <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-007-2-003"/> entirely the Constitution
                    of 1848, and, though published in 1909, has amendments only down to 1900, thus
                    omitting the amendments of 1904 and 1908.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, enough material is easily accessible and enough good work has been
                    done to make it possible for any one to go into the subject as far as he wants
                    to, and to get considerable enlightment. The official seven-volume compilation
                    of Federal and State constitutions edited by F. N. Thorpe, just referred to,
                    though imperfectly and not well indexed, contains most of the official documents
                    one needs, and can easily be supplemented so as to give one a collection
                    complete to within the last two years. Then, beginning with Judge J. A.
                    Jameson's The Constitutional Convention, a great work, though written
                    to prove the untenable proposition that the State constitutional convention is
                    legally under the direction and subject to the authority of the State
                    Legislature, with Bryce's luminous study in chapters XXXVII-XXXVIII of
                    his American Commonwealth, and Cooley's Constitutional Limitations,
                    there are a number of books and articles which not only incorporate an enormous
                    amount of work and so save the time of the investigator, but are well worth
                    reading. Among these I can only make mention of: Borgeaud, Adoption and
                    Amendment of Constitutions; Professor Dealey, Our State Constitution (supplement
                    to the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, 1907); Professor Garner's article upon The Amendment of
                    State Constitutions in the American Political Science Review, February, 1907;
                    Lobingier, The People's Law; Stimson, Law of the Federal and State
                    Constitutions of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, 1908, and the Year Book of Legislation issued by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York State</region>
                    </placeName> Library. Kew York has been given an exhaustive treatise in the
                    four-volume Constitutional History of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, by Lincoln, which supplies most of the material for, if it does
                    not often give the interpretation of the important constitutional developments
                    in that State. The best recent piece of work with which I am familiar has been
                    done by Walter Fairleigh Dodd, The Revision and Amendment of State
                    Constitutions, 1910, an accurate, complete, convenient and convincing treatment
                    of the subject. In <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-007-2-004"/> nearly every State,
                    moreover, there are full records of the formation of the constitution in the
                    shape of journals and debates of the constitutional conventions.</p>
            <p>The general outline of the developments of written State constitutions from the
                    revolution to the present generation, has been frequently traced and with
                    tolerable unanimity. We are not a people of striking originality in our
                    political life, and there is greater similarity between the constitutions
                    adopted in different States at a given time than one would expect. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state">New England States</region>
                    </placeName> have been slow to remake their constitutions. Three of them have
                    lasted 115 years or over, and the average of the constitutions in effect just
                    before <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> adopted a new one in 1903 was nearly one hundred years. Other
                    States have revised their constitutions more frequently, and, counting the <placeName>
                        <region type="state">New England States</region>
                    </placeName> in, the average life of a State constitution has been about
                    thirty-one years. These two facts, namely, that constitutions of different
                    States tend toward a given model, and that there are frequent revisions, make it
                    easy to distinguish certain periods, the first three of which are best described
                    perhaps by Mr. Bryce (American Commonwealth, Chap. XXXVIII), though he omits
                    some elements which have been decisive in many States, as the internal
                    improvement episode in the Middle West. The first period covers the first thirty
                    years of our independence, and constitutions formed during these years manifest
                    a dread of and reaction from executive tyranny, together with a disposition to
                    leave everything to the legislature. The legislature was supposed to represent
                    not so much the whole people as the best people. The people themselves as a
                    whole were not thought of as capable of much political action or wisdom.
                    Everything for the most part centered in the legislature, the choice of
                    governor, the control of the various departments of the government, even the
                    making and changing of the constitution itself.</p>
            <p>The second period extends from about 1805 to about 1846. States entering the
                    Union during this time, or revising their government, drew up documents giving
                    the people generally a larger part in the government. The suffrage was opened to
                    all white male adults, nearly all offices were to be filled by popular election,
                        <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-007-2-005"/> and terms of office were short, so as to
                    pass the offices around more frequently and give what President Jackson called a
                    "healthful action to the system" (Annual Message to Congress,
                    1829), and changes in the constitution were to be wrought chiefly if not solely
                    through constitutional conventions elected by the people.</p>
            <p>The third period began about 1845 or 1850, and was precipitated by the mistakes
                    and incompetency of the legislatures, by the enormous development of log rolling
                    and private legislation, and especially in this part of the countrjby the
                    extravagant and dangerously large expenditure for internal improvements. In the
                    old Northwest Territory, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> revised their constitutions and the other States came into the
                    Union with constitutions formed under this impulse. Important limitations,
                    especialljin financial matters, were put upon the power of the legislature, and
                    a curb was placed upon private legislation. In general, great distrust of the
                    legislature was shown. Generally the power and the length of term of the
                    governor was increased. He was more than before regarded as the representative
                    of the people—the fear of a strong executive was declining. The net
                    result of this development was a relative conservatism. Change in State
                    government became more difficult than before, and the policy of State
                    governments became generally more conservative.</p>
            <p>We have for some years been passing into a fourth period, in which is apparent a
                    tendency toward more complete democracy. The lengthening of the constitution so
                    as to make it a kind of direct popular legislation, the incorporation in new
                    constitutions or grafting bp amendment upon old ones of measures such as the
                    initiative, referendum, recall and direct primary, are indications of the
                    intention to bring the government more directly than before into the hands of
                    the people.</p>
            <p>In addition to this formal development of our State governments witnessed to by
                    changes in their organic law, there has been steadily taking place the usual
                    development of a more informal sort by judicial interpretation and by custom. As
                    has been frequently remarked, the shorter life, the easier methods of <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-007-2-006"/> amendment and the greater detail of our State
                    constitutions, have given less scope to judicial interpretation in our State
                    than in our national history. The question of constitutionality in State courts
                    is more frequently a matter of getting some clear meaning out of obscure or
                    ambiguous phrases, of overturning laws through technical errors in their
                    construction, in short, more artificial and less satisfactory than is the case
                    with questions of Federal legislation and constitutionality. The repetition of
                    this long and laborious process of construction is one of the strongest
                    arguments against constitutional revision. Perhaps the most clearly established
                    and universally developed principle of judicial action is this, that the State
                    legislatures are bodies of residuary and not of merely delegated authority, or,
                    to state it differently, that power not lodged elsewhere and not forbidden to
                    the legislature may be exercised by that body. Yet even this character of some
                    of the articles of some of the most recent constitutions, for instance, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> and the proposed constitution of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Mexico</settlement>
                    </placeName>, seem to deny.</p>
            <p>Custom has been, perhaps, more active in developing a new character in our State
                    governments than is generally supposed, Party organization, the lobby, the
                    growth of commissions, the non-partisan or bi-partisan reform of State
                    institutions such as prisons, reformatories and asylums, centralizing tendencies
                    in the management of local institutions, the socializing of education, care of
                    the public health, and numerous other easily recognized developments, have
                    transformed the conditions in which our political life is lived.</p>
            <p>It is easy to see now that democratic government in our States is not the simple
                    thing it was at first thought to be. The reaction from the strong executive of
                    colonial days to the omnipotent legislature, and the reaction back toward a
                    strong executive, the complicated and unsystematic efforts in new constitutions
                    to correct acknowledged abuses, show the need of something more than abstract
                    theory to guide us.</p>
            <p>There are those who think that the old threefold division of government into the
                    legislative, executive and judicial departments can no longer be maintained.
                    Certain it is that few if any <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-007-2-007"/> recent State
                    constitutions can be systematically arranged on that basis. They contain the
                    divisions of the executive, the legislative and the judicial, and then a
                    multitude of other provisions. Professor Dealey speaks "not merely of
                    the three historic departments of government, viz., the executive, the judicial
                    and the legislative, but also of the difierentiations from these, the
                    administration, the electorate, and that nameless agency which in every State
                    has the legal right to formulate the fundamental law, an agency n-hich ior want
                    of a better name may be called the ‘Legal Sovereign.’
                    " (Our State Constitutions, p. 2.) By
                    "administration" he means the boards and commissions, the
                    departments of state, treasury, education, the auditor, controller and other
                    departments by which most of the expert work of State government is done. By the
                    "electorate" he means the voters, considered not as the
                    "sovereign people," but as a government agency acting under
                    the constitution and possessing the power of appointment to office by election,
                    the judiciary power through service in juries, and in some States the power of
                    legislation through the referendum and the initiative. By the "legal
                    sovereign" he means practically the constitutional convention, that is,
                    the voters in their act of determining the fundamental law by which all other
                    acts of government are determined. This he thinks "is the great agency
                    through which democracy finds expression."</p>
            <p>Whether we agree with this rearrangement or not, we can easily see that the
                    simple outlines of government supposed in the revolution to prevail, are no
                    longer sufficient and no longer prevail. Legislative, executive and judicial
                    departments overlap in some instances (as legislative reference department,
                    commissions) and leave gaps in others (workingmen's compensation law.
                    etc.) There is room for a still greater development of commissions or
                    commissioners to deal with business and private interests than has yet taken
                    place, and, as Mr. Bryce points out in the last edition (1910) of the American
                    Commonwealth, the success in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> of bodies with quasi-judicial powers in dealing with quasi-public
                    interests would warrant a larger application of this department of government in
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Railroad, public <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-007-2-008"/> utilities and
                    other commissions such as have been introduced in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>, and, to some degree in most States, have
                    apparently been an effective and convenient method of dealing with a heretofore
                    complicated problem. I am not certain that our constitutions would not be
                    simpler and more intelligible instruments if we abandoned the threefold division
                    of government in them entirely and outlined our State government by the
                    description of the organs of government and the functions of government as they
                    are actually established, and did not try to bring them under the old
                    categories.</p>
            <p>The rise of new industrial and social conditions and new political devices not
                    foreseen by the makers of our State constitutions has brought the amending power
                    into greater prominence than formerly. For example, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana and many other States, any fair and effective
                    workingmen's compensation act is almost excluded by the wording of the
                    constitution, in some cases by an accidental phrase or two, and by the long
                    standing judicial interpretation of the constitution.</p>
            <p>There are many ways of amending constitutions in force in different
                    States—on the initiative of the legislature by varying majorities in
                    both branches, and the popular referendum in varying required majorities; or on
                    initiative of a commission appointed for that purpose (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>) and referendum of the people; or by the initiative of the
                    legislature and by action of a convention with or without a popular referendum;
                    or even by action of successive legislatures with two-thirds majority in each
                    house (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>).</p>
            <p>It is even possible in some States to secure a sort of higher or second degree
                    legislation by way of constitutional amendments. In cases where the constitution
                    contains lengthy, detailed and complicated provisions which are really in the
                    nature of legislation, ease of amendment is desirable and even necessary, if
                    embarrassing situations are to be avoided. JVhile there are objections to this
                    sort of constitutions and to their flexibility, such as the complication of
                    their judicial interpretation and the shifting of responsibility from the
                    legislature, there is no inherent or demonstrated reason why this practice
                    should not be admitted <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-007-2-009"/> into our governmental
                    system. The tendency is certainly in this direction, as is seen in the greatly
                    increased length of recent constitutions (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>, 175 pp.; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>

                    </placeName>, 144 pp.), and by the frequency of amendments. It has been figured
                    that in the decade 1894–1904 there were 412 amendments to State
                    constitutions formally and legally prepared, and 230 adopted. (Garner, American
                    Political Science Review, pp. 245–6.) <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> is especially prolific in this respect, having adopted amendments
                    42 times between 1888 and 1908. (Stimson, p. 123.) This year in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, after the victory of the progressives caused an overturning in the
                    State government, twentythree amendments to the constitution have been submitted
                    by the legislature to the people, providing among other things "for the
                    initiative and referendum, the recall for all elective offices, including
                    judges, and for woman's suffrage." (The Nation, May 11, 1911,
                    Vol. XCII, pp. 459–460.)</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana have constitutions among the most rigid in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The requirement by the former is that a proposed amendment must be
                    approved by "a majority of the electors voting" at the
                    election, while in the latter a majority of the electors is required, and the
                    judicial instruction has been that this means a majority of the people qualified
                    to vote whether they vote or not (69 Ind. 505, 1880), though the court has also
                    maintained that in the absence of registration the number voting shall be
                    presumed to be the number qualified to vote (156 Ind. 104, 1901). These and
                    other restrictions have made it extremely difficult to amend either
                    constitution, so that in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> the agitation ior direct primaries involved almost insuperable
                    obstacles, and in Indiana of late years constitutional amendments have been
                    apparently impossible. Indeed, the Indiana constitution has only been amended
                    twice since its adoption in 1851, namely, in 1873 and in 1881. Governor Marshall
                    has this year embarked in a revolutionary scheme of procuring the passage in the
                    legislature, by the support of the Democratic members, of a bill submitting a
                    new constitution to the people and providing means of counting the Democratic
                    party vote as a vote for the constitution. The present constitution, while it
                    provides a required process <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-007-2-010"/> for amendment,
                    makes no provision for the calling of another constitutional convention, nor
                    does it make any mention of the possibility of a new constitution. Governor
                    Marshall and members of the legislature have argued that his leaves the door
                    open for the legislature to submit a new constitution to the people. As far as
                    Indiana is concerned, however, there would be just as much precedent for the
                    governor himself submitting a new constitution to the people without the
                    intervention of the legislature. All precedents call for a constitutional
                    convention. If, on the other hand, the new constitution be, as is claimed by the
                    opposition, not in fact a new constitution but a series of amendments to the
                    old, the whole procedure is plainly unconstitutional. It seems, however, only a
                    mater of comparatively few years until many of the States of the Middle West
                    which have not recently revised or substantially amended their constitutions
                    will have to call constitutional conventions. These conventions have in the past
                    undoubtedly represented the highest intelligence and the best character of the
                    people, and have been in many respects the most successful element of our
                    political systems. Yet it is doubtful whether the immediate future will be an
                    opportune time for the formation of new constitutions. There is such a rapid
                    change of political condition that constitutions would have to be made on the
                    jump, and frequently the jump would be in the dark. The permanent effect of many
                    recent devices, such as the direct primary, is not yet clear. The initiative and
                    referendum, with much to commend them, have many vicious possibilities, and the
                    recall may not be productive of a higher quality of officeholder. The short
                    ballot is, perhaps, the one agitation now becoming acute which has the greatest
                    promise and the least weight of objection against it, but even this probably can
                    and should be tried out in city governments a little while longer before its
                    effects can be absolutely counted on. In short, just as in the construction of
                    dwelling houses so many new improvements are developing, such as the open-air
                    sleeping porch, the sun parlor, electrical housekeeping and laundry appliances,
                    that the perfect house of yesterday is unsatisfactory to-day, and prospective
                    builders gain by waiting a while, so in the construction <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-007-2-011"/> of State constitutions the time for wise and
                    permanent revision does not seem to be at hand.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile experience is being accumulated and definite scientific information is
                    becoming available. In our legislative reference libraries as well as in
                    universities and text-books, a science of comparative legislation is rapidly
                    taking form. We are becoming better able every year to judge accurately of
                    conditions and to know the exact workings of political institutions. It ought
                    not to be long before our law and constitution making bodies will have the
                    advantage which the English Parliament enjoys of having expert commissions to
                    study the effect of proposed legislation and expert political scientists to
                    properly draft statutes.</p>

                    ought to be done much more generally than it is. It is the purpose of the editor
                    to secure other similar church histories from time to time. A sketch of <placeName>

                    which this church had, and its leadership, especially in Mr.
                    McCulloch's pastorate, in introducing new methods and ideas in church
                    work, as well as developing philanthropic work in the city generally. In our

                    will be presented. In this article Mr. Roberts confines himself to a description
                    of the church itself. No one is better equipped for this work than Mr. Roberts.

                    In its struggle for existence it successfully weathered the various ills,
                    ailments, weaknesses, discouragements and backsets that such organizations are
                    subject to. It has been a power for good in this community.</p>
            <p>Not one of the original founders of the church now survives, I believe, but some
                    of its early members and active workers are still among its active supporters.</p>
            <p>It has had nine ministers, whose terms of service lasted for various periods, the
                    shortest being that of Rev. W. C. Bartlett, the first settled pastor, which
                    lasted less than one year, and the longest being that of Rev. Oscar C.
                    RlcCulloch, which lasted fourteen years, and was terminated by his death in
                    1892. Mr. McCulloch was the only pastor who died while connected with the

            <p>This church has owned and occupied three houses of worship: The original <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church, northwest corner of Meridian street and Monument Place, now
                    a part of the English Hotel; the second <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church, on the southeast corner of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Meridian</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> streets, on ground now occupied by the Federal Building, and the
                    third, on Central avenue, at Fourteenth street, which was acquired by purchase
                    and remodeled.</p>
            <p>The church, after its organization, until it built its first edifice, met in the
                    Senate chamber of the old State House. During the erection of the second
                    building the church services were held in the Grand Opera House. For several
                    months after the sale of the second church building we were privileged to use
                    the Jewish Temple on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> street.</p>
            <p>On the business and financial side, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church pursued a very steady and uniform course. It was always in
                    debt. The various schemes and devices which have had to be resorted to to meet
                    financial obligations, form a very considerable part of the records of its
                    trustees.</p>
            <p>The following passage in the records reveals the strain which was almost constant
                    for many years. I am sorry to say that the clerk of that meeting seemed to lose
                    his patience and his temper when he penned the following words (1864):
                    "Brother X. Y. Z. prayed that God would give the trustees of the church
                    ‘courage,’ " and then in parentheses,
                    "It is the impression of some, especially the clerk, that money would
                    be preferable."</p>
            <p>At the time of the resignation of Rev. 0. S. Dean, the financial condition of the
                    church was quite desperate, and it resulted in the <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-007-2-014"/> sale of the church, or rather surrender of the
                    church property, to W. H. English, who held a mortgage upon it. At that time the
                    church had the extreme good fortune to secure Rev. Oscar C. Mcculloch as pastor.
                    His vigor, enterprise and hopefulness, aided by his splendid financial ability,
                    resulted in the erection of the edifice universally known as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church (par excellence), which for so many years was the center of
                    much of the spiritual and intellectual life of this city.</p>
            <p>From the organization of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church to the present time, beginning with thirty-one members,
                    there have been enrolled upon the records 755 names.</p>
            <p>This church was born in the critical and troublous times just before the war, and
                    its early years were in the midst of the awful struggles and the dread
                    anticipations of the time that tried men's souls. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church, along with most of the other churches of this city, was
                    patriotic to the core. It contributed its due share of effort and sacrifice to
                    the patriotic cause.</p>
            <p>How doctrines, beliefs and policies vital at any given time may become obsolete,
                    if not unthinkable, within the life of a single generation even is well
                    illustrated by the following passage in the history of this church. To be
                    appended to the Covenant and Confession of Faith, which was adopted August 3,
                    1857, W. T. Hatch offered the following:</p>
            <p>"Resolved, As we who are about entering upon the organization of a
                    Congregational Church, believe slave-holding to be a sin that should exclude a
                    person from church membership, we will vote against the admission of any one who
                    believes it to be right."</p>
            <p>The resolution was adopted, whereupon a reconsideration was moved and the further
                    consideration of the question was set for the following Thursday evening. Upon
                    reconsideration the resolution was adopted without amendment by a vote of ayes
                    and nays. It required some courage for any church, and especially for one in
                    feeble infancy, to take such a stand at that time. It requires the exercise of a
                    very vivid historic imagination to picture to one's self the meaning
                    and effect of such a proceeding.</p>
            <p>Again, to a revision of the Rules of the Church, adopted in <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-007-2-015"/> May, 1862, the two following resolutions are of
                    interest as illustrating some of the sociological conditions of the times:</p>
            <p>"Resolved, That persons who make use of, or sell intoxicating liquors as
                    a beverage are guilty of an immorality which should exclude them from membership
                    in the Church.</p>
            <p>"Resolved, That we believe the holding of human beings as property is a
                    sin, the renunciation of which should be a condition of membership in the
                    Church."</p>
            <p>Article XIII, in the Rules of the Church, adopted originally in 1857 and revised
                    in 1862, reads as follows:</p>
            <p>"The censures inflicted on offenders shall be—private
                    reproof, public admonition, suspension, excommunication, according to the
                    aggravation of the case.</p>
            <p>"Notice of excommunication shall be given from the pulpit on the
                    Sabbath.</p>
            <p>"In case of private wrongs, the sufferer shall seek by private means to
                    reclaim the offenders, nor shall the matter be brought before the church until
                    all such means shall have been tried in vain. (See Matt. 18:15–16.)
                    In cases of public and notorious offenses the matter shall be brought before the
                    church without unnecessary delay. IVhen a member is accused, he shall be
                    seasonably furnished with a copy of the complaints and shall have a full
                    hearing."</p>
            <p>These rules of discipline have to our ears a kind of thin and far-away sound,
                    but, whatever may be their present validity, they have not always been a dead
                    letter, in testimony of which listen to an extract from the minutes of the
                    annual meeting of December 28, 1874, names being omitted</p>
            <p>"The clerk was then called upon to present to the church the cases of
                    three (3) of the church members which were referred by the committee to the
                    church for their final action (naming the three members.) The case of each
                    member was taken up separately, the church committee stating to the clerk the
                    facts in the case of each one, and showing that each one had been labored with
                    faithfully and long, and due effort was made to induce him to forsake the evil
                    of his ways and turn to the Lord, but all without avail.</p>
            <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-007-2-016"/>
            <p>"After some discussion of the matter, Deacon—made the
                    following motion in regard to the case of John L.: ‘Moved that we,
                    the members of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Congregational Church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in annual meeting assembled, suspend the said John L. from the
                    communion and fellowship of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Congregational Church, together with the rights and privileges
                    belonging to its members until at such time he shall return to the Lord with
                    repentance of heart, renouncing all his sins and seeking forgiveness of God for
                    his past transgressions.’ Said motion was seconded by –and
                    carried by a unanimous vote of the church."</p>
            <p>The same action was taken in regard to the other two offenders. As far as I know
                    this incident is quite unique in the history of this church. Whether this is to
                    be explained by the superior morale in the later church membership and the
                    absence of offenders or to a letting down of the sense of responsibility for the
                    conduct of its members, I leave for others to determine.</p>
            <p>To those who have watched the course of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church since the first twenty years of its existence, it may be a
                    curious question as to whether it had any history on the ecclesiastical side.
                    Did it ever stand for any type or form of theological belief? Indeed, it passed
                    through a great transition. Its history ecclesiastically may be divided into two
                    great periods. The first period is that of "strict
                    construction," and the second that of the "open
                    door." These terms are not exactly antithetical, but they connote very
                    different situations and perhaps they differ more widely in the letter than they
                    do in the spirit.</p>
            <p>The idea of a church without a creed was hardly thinkable by the founders and
                    early members of this church, and so among the first acts was to formulate a
                    confession of faith, to which every one entering the church was expected to
                    subscribe. Now, the first confession of faith was not of the deepest blue, nor
                    did it contain all the fine points of Calvinism, but it was nevertheless of a
                    decidedly cerulean complexion, and yet in the second year, or in 1859, it was
                    thought desirable to strengthen somewhat the bulwarks of the orthodox faith by
                    inserting a new article in the creed, as follows: "We believe that our
                    first parents were originally <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-007-2-017"/> holy; that
                    they sinned against God and that all their descendants are unholy and disposed
                    to sin, and, therefore, without redemption through Christ and regeneration by
                    the Holy Spirit, are exposed to eternal death."</p>
            <p>This article was probably penned by the Rev. N. A. Hyde, since he was chairman of
                    the committee which recommended its adoption, and was pastor at the time. At any
                    rate it very well expresses the doctrine generally preached in the so-called
                    orthodox pulpits of that time, and possibly it expresses the general orthodox
                    belief at the present time, though I fancy that few well instructed preachers of
                    the present would express it in precisely those terms.</p>
            <p>The period of the "open door" commences with the accession of
                    Oscar C. hIcCulloch to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> pulpit. It was the favorite watchword with Mr. McCulloch, and its
                    adoption as the motto of the church marks the utter obliteration of all dogmatic
                    statements in regard to theologic matters. Membership in the church after that
                    time was based upon conduct and aspiration alone, the article upon membership in
                    the constitution reading as follows: "All persons are eligible for
                    membership who will unite with us on the basis of these principles and pledge
                    themselves to carry out the objects of this church, it being distinctly
                    understood and agreed that the applicant is not committed to any philosophy of
                    faith, and that Christian spirit and Christian character shall be the only
                    requisites of membership."</p>
            <p>Upon this platform thereafter <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church stood. There was no disposition manifested in any quarter to
                    revert to the old creed, or Confession of Faith, as it was called, and, although
                    this attitude on the part of the church has brought upon it more or less
                    criticism from other denominations, it is a ground for satisfaction that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> pulpit was never turned into a polemic platform. Never was there
                    heard from it a word or tone of a controversial character. The preachers who
                    ministered to the church deyoted themselves wholly to constructive work and
                    teaching. In this matter it may fairly be claimed, I think, that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> has been a potent leader, at least in this city and State.</p>
            <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-007-2-018"/>
            <p>The old militant spirit has died out to a large extent, and now you will almost
                    never hear an attack made in one church upon the doctrines or practices of one
                    of a different name. The spirit of harmony and brotherhood prevails among all
                    Christian bodies which are working for the common uplift of mankind.</p>
            <p>It is not my object to go into a detailed account of the various activities in
                    which this church has engaged since its birth, though much might be said. The
                    story of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Institute and the beginning of furnishing means for intellectual
                    culture to busy people would make a whole chapter. The organizing of special
                    classes for night work has now been taken up by other churches and other
                    organizations, but the pace was set by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> under the masterly leadership of Mr. McCulloch. The reorganization
                    and the betterment of the charitable work of the city had the same initiative.</p>
            <p>There are only a few incidents of an anecdotal character in the experiences of
                    the church. One which is not without its humorous features I will mention. The
                    various seasons when the pulpit has been vacant have been critical and anxious
                    periods, as such must always be to any congregation. On one of these occasions,
                    March, 1870, a call was extended to the Rev. Minot J. Savage, who was then the
                    pastor of a Congregational church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Framingham</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mass. There was some correspondence, but finally Mr. Savage
                    declined, and it was then ascertained that while corresponding with this church
                    he had already virtually accepted a call to Hannibal, Mo.</p>
            <p>But three years later there was another vacancy in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> pulpit. Another call, an urgent one, was extended to Mr. Savage. He
                    replied practically agreeing to accept upon a number of conditions which he
                    named. The church met, and, after due consideration, agreed to comply with the
                    conditions named. It must be remembered that this was during the
                    "strict construction" period of the church's history.</p>
            <p>In a few days the leading members of the church were appalled and came near
                    having an attack of nervous prostration upon receiving another letter from Mr.
                    Savage, saying that his conditions having been approved and thus made a part of
                    the contract, <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-007-2-019"/> he was ready to acecpt the
                    call, but that he thought it right to inform the church that he was no longer
                    orthodox in his beliefs.</p>
            <p>This letter produced a sensation, and was even characterized by some of the
                    brethren as positively insulting. A meeting was hastily called and Mr. Savage
                    was informed that the deal was all off. The Rev. Minot J. Savage has become
                    since that time one of the most aggressive and notable preachers in the
                    Unitarian church.</p>
            <p>The first knowledge that I ever had of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, was in the summer of 1864, when I met its pastor, Rev. N. A. Hyde,
                    laboring in the camps and hospitals about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was in the service of the Christian Commission. In this
                    connection the following entry in the church reccrds, from the clerk's
                    annual report, dated April, 1863, interested me greatly:</p>
            <p>"Our pastor (N. A. Hyde), takes no heed who may be offended by the
                    truth, but preaches Christ and him crucified. The apologists for slavery, the
                    liquor traffic and licentiousness generally do not ask for membership or
                    sittings with us. Those in authority have the earnest prayers of the church for
                    God's guidance in crushing the unholy rebellion of the South, and the
                    effect of the pulpit teaching has been to induce quite a number of the
                    congregation to enlist in the Union army, some of whom have sacrificed their
                    lives for the cause. The Ladies' Sewing Society has not contributed as
                    much as usual to the church finances on account of the great demand for sanitary
                    goods for the army to which they have given largely, as well as to the new and
                    pressing calls of the suddenly disenthralled black men of the Southern
                    States."</p>
            <p>This sketch is already too long, but I shall nevertheless insert the names of
                    some notable men who have preached from Ply, mouth pulpit or spoken from its
                    platform: Dean Farrar, Matthew Arnold, Joel Parker, Wendell Phillips, Henry Ward

            <head>THE WORD "HOOSIER"</head>
            <byline>
               <hi rend="i">BY JACOB PIATT DUNN</hi>.</byline>
            <p>I PRESUME that most of the readers of the Quarterly have some interest in the
                    question of the origin of the word "Hoosier"; and I have been
                    having some experiences, in connection with it. that illustrate, in a small way,
                    the difficulty of exhausting the sources of history. After a prolonged study of
                    the question, in 1907, I published the results of my investigations in one of
                    the pamphlets of the Indiana Historical Society. One of the theories of the
                    origin of the word was that it was a family name, and I took the ground that I
                    had eliminated this theory by examination of the directories of a number of
                    Southern cities, and by inquiries of Southern congressmen, and others, without
                    finding any trace of such a name. Imagine my surprise on stumbling on the entry.
                    "Hoosier, Wm., lab., r. 603 W. llth," in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> directory of 1911.</p>
            <p>I called at the address and found that William had moved; but learned that he was
                    in the employ of the city street-cleaning department, and was stationed on the
                    next block to my place of business. He was entered on the city rolls, however,
                    as Wm. Hoozier, and the officials pronounced the name Ho-zher—long
                    "o." I then hunted up William, and found him a very
                    intelligent colored man. He said his name was Hoozer; and that it came from the
                    owner of his father, in slavery times, who was Adam Hoozer, of
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Yadkin county</region>, <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
               </placeName>. This was
                    interesting, because I had in 1907 reached the conclusion that
                    "Hoosier" was a corruption of "hoozer,"
                    which is a dialect word of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cumberland</settlement>, <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName>;
                    and here was an actual instance of exactly that corruption. William informed me
                    that the family name "Hoozer" was understood to be a
                    corruption of "Houser."</p>
            <p>In the publication of 1907 I stated that the earliest use of the word in print
                    that had been found up to that time, was its appearance in Finley's
                    poem, "The Hoosier's Nest," which was issued as the
                    "Carriers’ New Year's Address" of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-007-2-022"/> Journal on January 1, 1833. Soon after my
                    article appeared, I received a letter from Judge Timothy Howard, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who was then preparing a history of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph county</region>
                    </placeName>, in which he informed me that he had found an earlier use of the
                    word in "The Northwestern Pioneer and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>'s Intelligencer" of April 4, 1832. This newspaper
                    was published at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the article was as follows:</p>
            <p>"A Real Hoosier.—A sturgeon, who, no doubt, left
                        <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> on a trip of pleasure, with a view of
                    spending a few days in the pure waters of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>, had his joyous anticipations unexpectedly marred by running foul
                    of a fisherman's spear near this place—being brought on
                    terra firma, and cast into a balance, he was found to weigh 83 pounds."</p>
            <p>This publication accords with my conclusion, in 1907, that the word had been
                    applied to residents of Indiana for some time before it appeared in print, and
                    that it was originally a Southern slang or dialect word, signifying a rude or
                    uncouth rustic. The publishers of The Northwestern Pioneer and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>'s Intelligencer, at that time, were John D, and Jos. H.
                    Defrees, who were Tennesseeans, and no doubt familiar with the use of the word
                    in the South. The sturgeon, with its covering of plates, is a rough-looking
                    customer as compared with common freshwater fishes; and the obvious inference of
                    the use of the word "Hoosier" in this connection is that,
                    while it was being applied to Indiana people, the "real
                    Hoosier" was a rough-looking individual, like the sturgeon.</p>
            <p>A little later, while working on my history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, I ran across a still earlier use in print, in the
                    "Carriers’ Address" of the Indiana Democrat for
                    1832, which appeared in the issue of that paper for January 3, 1832. It was
                    customary at that time to include in these addresses references to current and
                    local politics; and in connection with the conflicting demands from the north
                    and south ends of the State, on the State legislature, for the disposition of
                    the public lands, this one says: <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-007-2-023"/>

            <p>This publication, connecting "hoosier" with "good
                    plantations," shows that the "country" idea in the
                    Southern use of the word was understood; while the inclusion of the word in
                    quotation marks indicates that, while it was then in use here in a jocular way,
                    it was liable to give offense if used seriously. That stage quickly passed away
                    after the publication of "The Hoosier's Nest," when
                    the name was adopted all through the State as the popular title for its
                    residents.</p>
            <p>Inasmuch as future discoveries of very early uses of the word in print will
                    probably be accidental, I would suggest that, if any be made, they be
                    communicated to the Quarterly, in order that they may be recorded in permanent
                    and available shape. Possibly some future discovery may throw more light on this
                    interesting local puzzle.</p>

                    importance of that great movement to the history of our country. The station I

                    such a height that the peaceful <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-007-2-025"/>
                    <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Garden</settlement>
                    </placeName> congregation split in two parts, and we have the unusual picture of
                    Quakers in a division over the question of slavery. A few years later a number
                    of prominent English Quakers visited <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and could not be led to believe that a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> church would split over this question, as they naturally supposed
                    that all Quakers were anti-slavery people. All their work was done with the main
                    branch of the church, and they turned the shoulder of scorn upon the
                    anti-slavery section of the denomination.</p>
            <p>Yet too often, when the Underground Railroad is mentioned, we think only of the
                    name of "Coffin," and in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName> we are accustomed to think that Levi Coffin and his wife,
                    "Aunt Katy," were the only prominent members of this great
                    movement, but such is not the case. Many men and many women gave a lifetime of
                    effort to this work. In connection with this work the author has had occasion to
                    trace the journeys and routes of fugitives, and only the call of duty led him
                    back to the subject. It is in the realm of probability that a map could be made,
                    showing all the stations in the great system that led through eastern Indiana
                    and western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and even the houses where the slaves stopped could be located. An
                    inquisitive person can trace, in a broad line, such a route from the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, and locate all the places where the stops were made. This would be
                    a very interesting topic of research, and one that is only open to history for a
                    few more years, and then all such knowledge will have passed into the undisputed
                    realm of tradition.</p>
            <p>Many obscure people helped in this work, and many men in and around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> seemed to have had as much share in the Underground Railroad as did
                    Levi Coffin. This statement is not made to detract anything from the fame of Mr.
                    Coffin, but to give credit to such people as deserve it. Many houses in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> sheltered fugitives, and it is reckoned that more than three
                    thousand passed through the Union Station alone. In this connection it might be
                    stated that this Union Station, this home of Levi Coffin, is still standing in a
                    fair state of repair. Some years back Mrs. William Scott, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, tried to start a fund to buy and preserve this historic place.</p>
            <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-007-2-026"/>
            <p>This house was shown to me and many stories told to me about these trying times
                    by the venerable and interesting <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> minister, John Wright Johnson. John Wright Johnson was a nephew of
                    Mr. Coffin and lived in the house at the time when so many slaves were on the
                    move northward. Mr. Johnson died last year at the age of ninety-two. It is with
                    regret that I say that much of his valuable first-hand knowledge passed away
                    with him. Much that this paper contains comes from him, aided by further
                    research.</p>
            <p>In this house, as in most other stations, there were no secret passages and
                    hidden pits for places of concealment. A close examination of the old Coffin
                    home shows that the only place of concealment was a small room, next to the
                    rafters, so small that only four or five people could lie down in the room. The
                    opening tothis room was so small that only one person at a time could crawl
                    through. The entrance to this room was concealed by an enormous bedstead. True,
                    there is a deep pit in the cellar, but, to the sorrow of the romantically minded
                    ones, this was dug to allow a weakened spring to furnish water for the house.</p>
            <p>The main safeguard of runaway slaves was the old AngloSaxon idea that each
                    man's house is his castle. The old Quakers knew this well, and would
                    allow no one to enter a house in search of fugitives without a warrant, and by
                    the time a search warrant could be secured the slave was many miles away. The
                    most interesting bit of information of Mr. Johnson's entire story was
                    that Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe had visited <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> twice, once while he was at the home of Mr. Coffin, and once in
                    after years. He asserted that much of the information about slave life, and
                    particularly the story of Eliza, was secured by Mrs. Stowe at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. If this is true, it is a point of much importance to the biography
                    of Mrs. Stowe and of some importance to history in general. Mr. Johnson seemed
                    to be very sure of his statement and repeated it a number of times to various
                    people. Dr. Hough, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fountain City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who probably knows more about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its anti-slavery history than any other living man, says that
                    Mr. Johnson is mistaken, or that his memory is in error. So a letter was sent to
                    the son of Harriet Beecher Stowe, asking if his <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-007-2-027"/> mother was ever at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fountain City</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His answer was very interesting and to the point, so I shall
                    presume to quote at length from his letter:</p>

                        <p>"In regard to your questioning concerning Mrs. Stowe and
                                    Uncle Tom's Cabin, I can not make definite answer. With
                                    regard to the story of the visit of hlrs. Stowe to the house of
                                    the old <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Mr. Coffin, you know as much as I do, and that is
                                    nothing at all. I doubt, if Mrs. Stowe was still living and in
                                    possession of her faculties, if she would remember anything
                                    about it. She always said herself that the original of Eliza was
                                    a young woman and her child who were taken off the place of old
                                    Van Sant at night by Professor Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher. Yet
                                    I think it by all means probable that there was a foundation to
                                    the story and it was not made up entirely of whole cloth. I do
                                    not know that hlrs. Stowe was ever in Indiana. She was in narrow
                                    circumstances for eighteen years after the marriage to my father
                                    and had heavy cares. She would not have gone to Indiana without
                                    reason. Can you locate either of her brothers, Charles or
                                    William, in that State as ministers of the Presbyterian Church?
                                    If you can, you have established the probability of a visit to
                                    that State, made by her; otherwise it is improbable that she
                                    ever made such a visit. If she did visit Indiana before writing
                                    Vncle Tom's Cabin, it was when she had no more idea of
                                    writing the book than of paying a visit to the moon.</p>
                        <p>"I can not help you in this matter. You know the
                                    recollections of old men consist for the most part of Wahrheit
                                    und Dichtung. Old men dream dreams and young men see visions,
                                    and that gets history in a devil of a mess. If one of Mrs.
                                    Stowe's brothers were living near or about the place in
                                    question, you have shown cause for her being there, but if no
                                    such cause exists, I think you will have to regard the whole
                                    matter as an old man's visicn and a young
                                    man's dream.</p>
                        <p>"To show you how unreliable people are,—when
                                    my mother wrote her introduction to the illustrated edition of
                                    Uncle Tom's Cabin, she told about being in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state">Washington</region>
                                    </placeName> in 1862 and hearing Lincoln speak those words about

                                    unrequited toil, etc.’ ‘Why,
                                    mother,’ I said, ‘Mr. Lincoln did not
                                    utter those words for years afterwards, and how could you have
                                    heard them before he spoke them?’ But you might as
                                    well argue with a stone—she stuck to it that she
                                    heard them uttered in 1862 and it had to be printed in the book
                                    that way. That is the reason that the historians have to spend
                                    so much time hunting around in dark cellars for black cats that
                                    aren't there and never were.</p>

            <p>Evidently Mr. Stowe does not think very much of the reliability of history in
                    general and local history in particular, but I have promised myself the work of
                    following up the clue in the records of the Presbyterian Church at my earliest
                    convenience. From this report many say that Levi and Catherine Coffin are the
                    prototypes of Samuel and Rachel Hollidap, so well portrayed by Mrs. Stowe.
                    Further relation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Levi Coffin to Uncle Tom's Cabin can be traced more
                    easily. The story of Eliza is so well known that the mentioning of the name is
                    sufficient to bring the story back to your mind at once. The man who helped
                    Eliza up the bank of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Ripley</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, was the Rev. William
                    Lacey, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He belonged to a secret service who patroled the banks of the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, watching for runaways. He told a few
                    people, his own brother not <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-007-2-029"/> being among the
                    few, how he watched her cross from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side with her pursuers in close chase. When she reached the river
                    she hesitated a moment, but seeing her capture was sure. she clasped her child
                    more closely, and leaped from one cake of ice to another. At times she seemed
                    lost, but would put the child on the next cake of ice and would drag herself
                    onto the same and continue her journey. Finally, nearly frozen, clothing wet to
                    the skin and entirely exhausted, she reached the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> side and was helped up the bank by this <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> preacher. She was taken along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> branch of the railroad, and, being a valuable slave, was hotly
                    pursued, and so, as was the custom, was sent over to the Indiana side and was at
                    the Coffin homestead for several days. Here she was named Eliza by Mrs. Coffin.
                    She was sent on to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, and was seen here by hlrs. Coffin years later, on a visit to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. This much of the story seems to be true from all documentary
                    evidence, notwithstanding the statements in Mr. Stowe's letter.
                    Probably what has misled him was that his mother put the character of some
                    well-known negro woman into the story of Eliza, but the slave woman who made the
                    trip across the ice was without doubt sent through the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> station.</p>
            <p>About a half-mile east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> stands the home of Mr. Hough, who was also prominent in the fight
                    against slavery. Here occurred one of the exciting incidents of the history of
                    the little town. Escaped slaves whose masters were not on their trail frequently
                    worked in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> for a year at a time, mingling with the free negroes who were in
                    the neighborhood. One night fifteen slave-hunters, led by a man from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, galloped into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, making dire threats unless the particular slave for which they
                    were searching be given up. By chance this slave was not at Mr. Hough's
                    home on this particular evening, so Mr. Hough detained the, men until the slave
                    could get into town and hide. After a thorough search the slave-hunters went
                    back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and began the second search. The slave was inside a house that was
                    so near the street that several times he could have reached out and touched his
                    master. A bugle call had been given and free negroes began to assemble, armed
                    with shotguns, <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-007-2-030"/> knives and clubs; and many
                    other anti-slavery men came, until there was quite an excited crowd. One
                    Kentuckian being thoroughly enraged, made some very wild threats and was covered
                    by a shotgun in a negro's hands. The two sides waited for the opening
                    shot that should signal for the general battle. Rather exciting for a town full
                    of Quakers. Some declared they would have that negro if they had to burn <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but others decided that the negro was not worth enough to cause
                    the loss of their own precious lives, and they finally left without the slave.
                    This was the most determined attempt ever made in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> to capture a runaway slave.</p>
            <p>Informers had but scant courtesy at the hands of the Quakers. No harm was ever
                    actually offered them, but life was made so uncomfortable that they soon left
                    the vicinity, although a few secret friends of slavery were left until the Civil
                    War.</p>
            <p>An interesting phase of the work was a sewing society formed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> to prepare clothing for runaways. Often the slaves were shoeless
                    and almost naked, and this society spent many hours in preparing clothing for
                    their unbidden but not unwelcome guests. Needing money to purchase those things
                    which they could not make, this society made rag carpets, hats, bonnets and
                    other kinds of hand work, and sold them to get money to buy the needed articles.
                    Such women as Bulah Puckett, Elizabeth Stanton, Elizabeth Lacey, Keziah Hough,
                    and many other women were members. Women are still living in this State who as
                    girls were members of this society.</p>
            <p>One favorite story of Mr. Johnson was of the largest company that ever passed
                    through his uncle's home on their way north. The party was gathered
                    together in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and journeyed to the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> at night. They
                    were ferried across by a friendly white man near the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. While in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union county</region>
                    </placeName> a group of their masters caught up with them and fired repeatedly
                    at them, wounding several. They succeeded in escaping through the growing corn
                    and reached an underground station at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hicklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Here, without dressing their wounds, they were placed in two
                    wagons and hurried north. They traveled this way two nights until they reached
                    Levi Coffin's home. Mrs. <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-007-2-031"/> Coffin was
                    awake, and hearing the sound of wagons, arose arid went to the door. She spoke
                    to the men in charge and said, "IVhat have you got there?" A
                    driver replied, "All Kentucky." "IVell, bring all
                    Kentucky in," was her reply. They were brought in, fed and warmed.
                    Coffin then made one of his characteristic speeches: "Seventeen
                    full-grown darkies are about as much as the cars can bear at one time. You may
                    switch off and put your locomotives in my stable and we will water and feed
                    them." This party was worth about $20,000 in any slave
                    market, but to Mr. Coffin they were so many poor, destitute men. Later in the
                    day Dr. Way and Dr. Stanton, two well-known abolitionists, were called in to
                    remove bullets and shots from the bodies of four of the runaways. Clothing was
                    furnished for all seventeen by the sewing society before mentioned. They were
                    badly in need of clothing, as they were almost naked from their trip through the
                    woods and corn fields. After two days' rest, they were started for the
                    home of John Bond, in the Cabin Creek settIement, but early the next day,
                    Acquilla Jones, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, rode to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, bringing the information that slave-hunters were in force at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This news was sent to John Bond, and he forwarded the same to the
                    station in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Grant county</region>
                    </placeName>. Here the negroes were resting, thinking themsehes secure in this
                    rather sparsely settled section of the country. But the fugitives were scattered
                    in various homes until the hunters lost trail. True to report, these hunters
                    came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> by ones and twos, purporting to be cattle and horse buyers. There
                    were three sets of hunters in this party, and two of them followed the fairly
                    wellknown trails to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. The third remained in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName> for a while. Exasperated by their failure, this third party started
                    for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, threatening to burn Mr. Coffin's home and kill all negro
                    lovers in the town. Warning was hastily sent to the town, but the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> was not much frightened, and did not even take the trouble to guard
                    his property. This party is supposed to be the one that declared for the first
                    time that there must be an Underground Railroad and that Levi Coffin must be the
                    president of the road. Soon after that, Mr. Coffin began to receive <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-007-2-032"/> letters addressed to the President of the
                    Underground Railroad.</p>
            <p>A story of Mr. Coffin's appearance before the grand jury of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName> will help to explain how difficult it was to detect the work of
                    this underground railroad. Mr. Coffin was summcned before the grand jury at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to answer for violating the fugitive slave law, although how a
                    State grand jury could inquire about the violation of Federal statutes is hard
                    to understand. When asked by the foreman if he knew of any cases of assault and
                    battery or outbreaks near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he answered that they were nearly all Quakers and were peaceable
                    people. Then a prominent friend of slavery who was on the jury took up the
                    questioning. He asked Mr. Coffin if he knew of any violation of the fugitive
                    slave law in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Coffin said persons often passed through his neighborhood who
                    said they were slaves, but he did not know how true their statements were, as
                    Indiana law did not presume that a slave could tell the truth. He then asked if
                    Mr. Coffin was not guilty of hiring free colored people, who had not given bond
                    and security as the law required. Mr. Coffin answered, "I presume I am
                    guilty of violating that statute, for I am in the habit of hiring help whenever
                    I need it and ask no questions." One of the jury asked if Mr. Coffin
                    knew of any case in the county where the requirements of this law had been
                    fulfilled, and it was shown that the law was a dead letter in southeastern
                    Indiana. Then Dr. Way was called in and asked about the party of seventeen that
                    had been at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and at whose place they had stopped. "At Levi
                    Coffin's," was the answer of the doctor, and then told that he
                    had helped to dress their wounds. He was asked, "Did you know they were
                    slaves escaping from their masters?" The doctor answered, "We
                    had no evidence, except their own statements. They said they were slaves from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, but their evidence is worthless in law in this State."
                    This was the last legal proceedings in that section against anti-slavery people.</p>
            <p>But, on the other hand, there was a rather notable proceeding brought by these
                    Quakers against the slaveholders. The law of Indiana protected people from
                    slavery if the master attempted to <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-007-2-033"/> live in
                    Indiana. A slave could be taken through the State if the master did not make any
                    purchases amounting to location. If he did locate, the slaves were free. A Dawes
                    family from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> was traveling through Indiana to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, and sickness compelled them to stop at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Being tanners, they found a tanyard in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName> that could be bought at a great bargain. The terms agreed on were
                    very satisfactory, but the thought occurred to them that if they located in
                    Indiana they would lose their slaves, so they decided to go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and sell the slaves across the river, and then come back and close
                    the contract. Before they started, however, they bought a lot of tanbark and
                    furniture, which was, by Indiana law, location, and the moment they did so the
                    slaves were free. The party started for the South and were followed to Kewport
                    by Dr. Hyatt, from Winchester, who told the story to a crowd at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This group went to ‘Squire Curtis and Mr. Coffin swore
                    out a kidnaping warrant, which was given to Constable John Hunt to serve. The
                    constable summoned a posse of ten and started in pursuit. At midnight the men of
                    the party were arrested near the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> line and were brought back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As the minimum penalty for kidnaping was $500 fine and
                    two years in the penitentiary, the slaveholders were quite willing to make out
                    papers of emancipation and avoid trouble for their unwitting offense.</p>
            <p>As Dr. Hough so well says, there are many unnamed anti-Slavery heroes of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and these need considerable place in a paper of this size. Eli
                    Osborn was quite celebrated by one little incident of the raid before mentioned,
                    when the free negroes and the slave-hunters came so near to exchanging shots.
                    One of the Southerners told Osborn that he would fight him a single combat, but
                    he told the man that he was a man of peace, but if he would get down off his
                    horse he would play him a game of marbles. This story was repeated to me by
                    Linden Osborn, his son. This son, who was one of the conductors of the railroad,
                    told me a number of interesting stories of his trips. He is the only man living
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> that actually took a share in the work of helping runaways. He is a
                    man past eighty years of age, very deaf, <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-007-2-034"/> but
                    his eyes still kindle with fire when the stirring days are recalled to him.</p>
            <p>Major M. M. Lacey, of Kewport, is another man who remembers personally of these
                    times. The following story is told in the major's own words:
                    "In about 1843, when a very small boy, I was playing in the barn, and
                    by chance jumped from a high beam down in the mow of hay. The result was
                    astonishing, as I sank until almost covered up, and it was equally astonishing
                    to others, for no sooner had I landed than I found myself mixed up in a
                    squirming mass of something very much alive. The hay seemed alive with shining
                    eyes and black faces. The interview was very short and contained no apologies
                    from either side. The first thing was to tell mother, who told me for the first
                    time the story of slavery. She told me that under no circumstances must I tell
                    any one what I had seen, and it was well that such a command was made, for the
                    same day, while playing along the road, three strange men came riding by and
                    they asked me if I knew a man by the name of Levi Coffin. Of course they knew
                    all about him, and after many other questions, asked me if I knew where any
                    strange negroes were hid. I must have answered them in a hesitating way, and one
                    of the men pressed me closely in questions, and finally pulled out a roll of
                    bills and offered me $100 if I would tell him where any negro was
                    hid. I was only eight years old and much frightened, but at least kept the
                    faith."</p>
            <p>Thus not even from children could knowledge of this mysterious railroad be
                    secured.</p>
            <p>There was an organization of young men who obligated themselves for certain
                    duties in the aid of the colored people. Sometimes they would hire speakers,
                    sometimes they would do scout duty. One duty which required steadfastness of
                    purpose was to take turns in riding to the negro settlement beyond Spartansburg
                    to teach in the Sabbath school. Such young men as Moses Hough, Daniel Hill,
                    Thomas Woodard, Calvin Thomas and others carried on this kind of work.</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent workers was Pusey Graves. He was an earnest, brilliant
                    man, and spent his life in the fight against slavery. He was a candidate for
                    Congress on the Liberty <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-007-2-035"/> ticket in 1844, at
                    the time James G. Birney ran for the presidency. He made a very thorough canvass
                    in a then hopeless cause, and was often greeted with abuse and stale eggs. He
                    often traveled with an eloquent negro by the name of Lester, and the two made
                    many speeches together. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond Palladium</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1844 had several accounts of his speeches, but always mentioned
                    them in terms of contempt.</p>
            <p>Further claim to honor is made by the Quakers of old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> for some of their numbers in connection with the candidacy of Henry
                    Clay in 1844. Henry Clay was to appear in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the fall of 1842 and try to swing Indiana into the Whig column.
                    The Quakers of the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, headed a petition to Mr. Clay, asking him to show his attitude on
                    the slavery question by emancipating his slaves. Over two thousand names were
                    secured in this petition, and then the trouble was to present the petition. The
                    Whigs, wishing to prevent the presentation of the petition, refused to allow the
                    Abolitionists to see Mr. Clay until he appeared on the platform in the
                    afternoon. Then the managers asked for any petitions that might be ready to
                    present to Mr. Clay. One powerful Quaker by the name of Hiram hlendenhall
                    struggled to the platform carrying a petition. He was bloody and bruised by the
                    mob-like actions of the crowd, but presented the petition, which Mr. Clay
                    refused to take, although it was read to him by one of the men on the platform.
                    Mr. Clay made answer: "Go home, go home, mind your affairs of the
                    North, and we of the South will attend to ours!" [For a full account of
                    this episode see this magazine, Vol. IV, No. 3, pp. 117–128.] The
                    report of this was carried to the Abolitionists in the East and was one more
                    cause for the large vote of Birney in that campaign. The vote of Birney in <placeName>

                    </placeName> was large enough to draw strength from Mr. Clay, and thus elect Mr.
                    Polk. Many men say that this happening was the cause of Mr. Clay's
                    defeat. However, this may be far-fetched, and it is probable that this assertion
                    should be placed along with those other assertions, such as the length of
                    Cleopatra's nose, or the heavy dew on the morning of the battle of
                    Waterloo. But the incident at least had a bearing on this most important
                    campaign, and it is of note that <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-007-2-036"/> one <placeName>

                    home, Mr. Clay."</p>
            <p>The free negroes should not be passed with mere mention, as they were decidedly
                    active in the cause. They were not trusted fully by the Friends on account of
                    some well-known infirmities of character, but did their best for the cause.
                    Their settlements at Cabin Creek and Spartansburg were often searched by
                    slavehunters without the formality of a search warrant. The most famous of all
                    these free negroes was Lewis Talbert, who made many trips South to pilot to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> his less fortunate brothers. He led away more than
                    $40,000 worth of property. At one time he attended school at the
                    Union Literary Seminary, of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Greenville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> in hunt of him. This news was carried to Kewport and from there a
                    ride was made on a stormy night to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greenville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Talbert again made his escape. Finally he was captured,
                    escaped and was never heard of again, probably being captured and killed by his
                    captors, who wished to make an example of him.</p>
            <p>Quite an honor roll might be given, besides the numerous names already mentioned,
                    of those who took a place in these exciting times, but their names would not be
                    of particular interest here. But their deeds live after them, and much credit
                    must be given the unnamed heroes who endured trials and hardships that they
                    might aid the oppressed. Their names should be placed on the honored rolls of
                    those who stood true in the cause of human liberty.</p>

                    </placeName> Historical Society at its February meeting, 1911.]</p>
            <p>WHEN I assumed the duties of the presidency of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society in the fall of 1909, it became my office to
                    speak of the life and work of one of the society's most valued members.
                    I refer to Mr. Williamson B. Seward, who had died the previous summer. Mr.
                    Seward was present at the organization of this society, and he may, therefore,
                    be called one of its charter members. He was constantly and actively interested
                    in its work. The death of such a man is a distinct loss to such an organization,
                    whose active friends seem to be limited to only a faithful few.</p>
            <p>Since the last meeting of the society another of its original members has been
                    removed by death. This time it is the honored president of the society, whose
                    sudden removal from our association and from this community we are called upon
                    to mourn.</p>
            <p>It is certain that not one of us was more deeply interested in the work and
                    welfare of this historical society than was Judge Henry Clay Duncan. No one has
                    been more constant, more faithful, or more efficient in promoting the interest
                    and success of our meetings and of our primary purpose. No one has contributed
                    more, or more valuable material, to the papers and proceedings of the society.
                    It seems, therefore, fitting and proper that some expression of our appreciation
                    of his worth and services, and a brief sketch of his life's work,
                    should be placed upon our records as a part of our proceedings today.</p>
            <p>Henry Clay Duncan was born on a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lawrence county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, farm five miles east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, January 16, 1845. He died suddenly, without warning to family or
                    friends, on January 30, 1911, having just entered upon his sixty-seventh year.
                    He was the son of pioneer parents, of sturdy, substantial stock. His father,
                    Judge William Duncan, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lawrence county</region>
                    </placeName>, of <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-007-2-038"/> Scotch-Irish stock, was
                    born in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Jefferson county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, February 16, 1803.
                    He came to Indiana in 1826 while the country was new, and, as he and his kind
                    had to hew out their homes in the wilderness, they may be said to have helped to
                    lay the foundations of the State. The elder Duncan was a publicspirited citizen,
                    honest, sturdy, straightforward, always commanding the confidence of his
                    neighbors, ever alive to the interest of the community in which he lived and
                    ready to cooperate for its moral and material advancement. He was honored
                    repeatedly with public positions in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lawrence county</region>
                    </placeName>, being probate judge for twenty-five years, county surveyor and
                    county assessor.</p>
            <p>Judge Henry Clay Duncan's mother was Mary Haws Malott, also born in
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Jefferson county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, in 1807, about
                    twelve miles east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She was of mixed French Huguenot and German descent, French on the
                    side of her father, Hiram Malott, and German on the side of her mother, Mary
                    Haws, who was educated wholly in the German language and followed her Bible
                    reading and worship in that tongue alone.</p>
            <p>William Duncan and Mary Haws Malott were married on September 24, 1824. They
                    emigrated to Indiana and settled on their <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lawrence county</region>
                    </placeName> farm in 1826. Their oldest son, Bolivar Duncan, was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> in 1825. The other seven children were born on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lawrence county</region>
                    </placeName> homestead, about a mile from the old Leatherwood Christian Church.
                    The father died in 1872, the mother in 1887. They were frugal, thrifty,
                    industrious people, the father saving the dollars and the mother the dimes, and,
                    as such people usually do, they prospered in this world's goods. They
                    were not rich as riches are counted to-day, but they were forehanded and
                    provided well for the material, moral and intellectual needs of their children,
                    and left them at last the far richer heritage of exemplary lives and characters.</p>
            <p>Henry Clay Duncan was the youngest of the eight children. He was educated in the
                    country schools, and for one term attended the old Northwestern University, now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, and in January, 1864, at the age of nineteen, he entered
                    Indiana University. While he was a young student in the university he <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-007-2-039"/> enlisted among the "boys in blue"
                    in the army of the Union, for the hundred days’ service. His regiment
                    was the One Hundred and Thirty-sixth Indiana Volunteers, in command of Colonel
                    John W. Foster.</p>
            <p>After serving the hundred days for which he had enlisted, young Duncan re-entered
                    the university and graduated with the class of 1868, and later from the law
                    class of 1870. In 1869 he was enrolling clerk in the Indiana Legislature. He
                    read law with the Hon. Moses I?. Dunn, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and in 1872 formed a partnership with Dunn. In 1874 he came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and formed a partnership with John W. Buskirk. After the death of
                    Buskirk, Duncan formed a partnership, in 1888, with Ira C. Batman, then a young
                    lawyer only three years out of college, and this law partnership continued until
                    the death of Judge Duncan a few weeks ago,—a period of twenty-three
                    years. Mr. Batman speaks of him with the warmest regard, recognizing in him a
                    lawyer of the highest efficiency, loyal, faithful, and untiring in the cause in
                    which he had enlisted; with honorable conceptions of duty to his client and to
                    the public; with strong, combative, though straightforward, qualities that made
                    him an opponent worthy of the stoutest antagonist at the bar.</p>
            <p>Judge Duncan was married on December 11, 1872, to Sadie Cummings, a daughter of
                    Dr. A. F. Cummings, one of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s leading physicians, whose home was on the west side of
                    North College avenue between Seventh and Eighth streets, Five children were born
                    to this union, four of whom survive. The son, Frank C. Duncan, was the efficient
                    secretary of this society for a number of years.</p>
            <p>In 1880 Judge Duncan was elected prosecuting attorney for the judicial circuit
                    composed of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Monroe</region>, <region type="county">Lawrence</region>, <region type="county">Orange</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin counties</region>
                    </placeName>. In 1888 he was the Republican candidate for Congress in the old
                    Democratic Fifth Congressional District, but was defeated by the Hon. George W.
                    Cooper, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who represented that district for three terms in Congress.</p>
            <p>In 1890 Duncan was appointed by Governor Hovey as judge of the Tenth Judicial
                    Circuit to fill out the unexpired term of <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-007-2-040"/>
                    Judge Pearson, who had died. In his candidacy for re-election Duncan was
                    defeated by Hon. R. W. Miers.</p>
            <p>In 1894 Judge Duncan was elected as State Senator to represent the counties of
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Monroe</region>, <region type="county">Brown</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName>—normally a strong Democratic district. During his
                    service in the Legislature he helped to secure the passage of the maintenance
                    tax bill for the support of the State institutions for higher education, to take
                    the place of the precarious and vacillating biennial appropriations. He also
                    drew the bill converting the southern Indiana prison into a reformatory. After
                    the adjournment of the Legislature Judge Duncan was appointed by Governor Mount
                    a director in that institution, and served in that capacity for four years.</p>
            <p>Judge Duncan was not only prominent and efficient in public affairs, but he was,
                    as I have indicated, an active and busy lawyer. Not only was he vigorous and
                    successful as a practicing attorney, occupying as he did for more than a quarter
                    of a century a leading place at the bar, but he was prominent and helpful in
                    many of the important business enterprises of this city. He was a director of
                    the First National Bank for thirty years, since 1880, and at the time of his
                    death was vice-president of that important institution. He was president of the
                    Workingmen's Building and Loan Association, one of the oldest and most
                    reliable of our financial institutions. He u-as a devoted and life-long member
                    of the Christian Church, joining at the age of sixteen, and he was an elder and
                    trustee of the church at the time of his death.</p>
            <p>Last June Judge Duncan was elected president of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society and at its first meeting for the year last
                    September, he read a strong plea for a larger and more intelligent public
                    interest in the history of the county and its people. The last paper presented
                    to this society at its January meeting, 1911, was by Judge Duncan on "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName> in the Mexican War," and those of us who heard the paper
                    will bear testimony to its interest and value. Other papers presented by Judge
                    Duncan within the last few years were on "James Hughes,"
                    "The White Caps in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName>," "The New <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-007-2-041"/>
                    Harmony Settlement," and "Austin Seward." It was the
                    intention of Judge Duncan to collect those papers in typewritten form, bind them
                    and present them in durable shape to the society. It is to be hoped that this
                    may still be done, for these papers are among the most interesting and valuable
                    contributions that the society has produced.</p>
            <p>No one had a better sense or appreciation than Judge Duncan of the useful
                    function and possibilities of a local society like this. He had the historic
                    spirit as well as a fine historic scent. We pursued a subject with a keen
                    intelligence, and what he found and put on paper had substance and value to it.
                    He had an unusual appreciation of values. By this I do not mean that he knew the
                    value of dollars and cents, or of real estate, or that he succeeded in business.
                    He did all this, but the values that Judge Duncan appreciated most highly were
                    higher and more lasting than material things. He knew what was worth preserving.
                    He knew how precious to a people is the record of its past and a spirit that
                    cares for its past. He thought of how that past can best be preserved, and it
                    was his deep conviction that no people, national or local, can ever come to much
                    in its posterity who has no concern for its ancestry. He saw the local past
                    fading into forgetfulness. He sought to rescue it, give it a record, and make it
                    secure. He was interested in tradition, but he hew how uncertain and fleeting
                    are the memories of men, and he therefore sought to sift and to save in
                    permanent iorni, the essential facts, the actual deeds and achievements of our
                    worthy men and women in State and neighborhood life. This was one of his
                    chiefest interests. It is the chief interest of this society, in whose life and
                    aim Judge Duncan was so large a part. It is but right that the name and worthy
                    services of Henry Clay Duncan should ever be preserved and recognized in the
                    society's annals. He gave his services to the community in othcr ways,
                    but what he did for local history alone is sufficient to give him a place and a
                    name in the life and history of southern Indiana.</p>

            <p>The attendance and the program of this meeting were rather above the average.
                    Much credit for this is due the president of the section, Professor F. S.
                    Bogardus, of the Indiana State Normal School, who acted as host for the
                    occasion. The program was carried out practically as announced, more time being
                    given than has been customary to historical papers embodying actual
                    contributions to history, a plan which seemed to meet the approval of those in
                    attendance.</p>

            <head>A CENTURY OF INDIANA.</head>
            <p rend="center">[By Edward E. Moore. Illustrated. pp. 266, xxii. American Book
                    Company, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, 1911. 75 cents].</p>
            <p>Senator Moore's book is entitled to high praise. It is an interesting,
                    convenient and useful sketch of the history of Indiana. Largely taken up with
                    political matters, and showing occasionally an inclination of undue friendliness
                    for the Republican party, it gives considerable attention to the agricultural,
                    industrial, social and educational progress of the State. The most serious
                    omission, perhaps, is the absence of any considerable notice of churches and of
                    religious developments, with the exception of an inaccurate notice (p. 42) on
                    the first Protestant preaching service in the State, corrected in a footnote,
                    and an appendix upon the socialistic experiments of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> which touches upon the religious views of the Rappites.</p>
            <p>The work is intended partly for use in schools and should be introduced into all
                    school libraries of the State. It is elementarr enough for use even in the
                    grammar grades, and yet substantial and valuable enough for work in high
                    schools. Its usefulness is increased by tables of statistics, and the present
                    constitution of the State given in the appendix.</p>
            <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-007-2-048"/>
            <p>From a critical point of view exception must be taken to several points. Modern
                    study seems to point to a common stock as the aboriginal race of North America,
                    including the Mound Builders, who should therefore be classed as Indians and not
                    as a distinct race. W. H. Smith's History of Indiana is drawn on
                    extensively, though ordinarily classed as a very poor historical authority. The
                    capture of Quebec in 1759 did not complete the conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, as stated on page 48, but was followed by a campaign against
                    Montreal, which did not surrender until 1760. Many other minor inaccuracies
                    might be pointed out, but they do not prevent the book from being of great use
                    as an introduction to the history of the State. It is not the highest authority
                    upon the history of Indiana, but it is a very interesting sketch of its
                    development.</p>
