            Pastor in Politics:
            The Congressional Career of the Reverend Gilbert De La Matyr

            Like other middlewestern states, Indiana was deeply affected by the controversy over currency and
                    financial reform in the 1870s. The issues transcended traditional party lines, for neither of the
                    two major parties was immune to the discord generated by the conflict over the role of paper money
                    as opposed to specie, the powers of the National Banking System, and questions regarding the public
                    debt. Ultimately a substantial number of the reformers repudiated the established parties to
                    organize the Independent or Greenback party. The degree of success enjoyed by the new movement
                    varied greatly from one state to another, but it appears to have reached its peak in most sections
                    of the country in the elections of 1878. In Indiana the Greenbackers polled 9.5 per cent of the
                    total vote for the state ticket in 1878 and held the balance of power between the Republican and
                    Democratic parties in the General Assembly. More importantly, they sent the Reverend Gilbert De La
                    Matyr, a Methodist clergyman, to 
                        Washington
                     as one of the handful of currency reformers comprising the Greenback delegation in the 
                        United States
                     Congress.1
            
            Within the context of his conception of Christian citizenship, it was entirely logical for De La
                    Matyr to seek to extend his activities beyond those customarily associated with a parish ministry.
                    In the process he obtained a wider forum for the dissemination of that special combination of
                    social, political, and theological ideas that constituted his point of view. When he was elected to
                    Congress in 1878, he was a relative newcomer both to Indiana and to its politics, but he had run for
                    office on one prior occasion, in 1867 as the Republican candidate for state prison inspector of the
                    state of 
                        New York

            Born on July 8, 1825, in the upstate 
                        New York
                     community of Pharsalia, De La Matyr learned the carpenter's trade before
                    entering the ministry of the Methodist Episcopal church as a young man of twenty-four.3 In the fall of 1874 he arrived in 
                        Indianapolis
                     to assume the pastorate at Roberts Park Methodist Church,4 one of
                    the city's leading congregations. Founded in the 1820s, Roberts Park was referred to as the
                    "mother" of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Methodist churches because of its role in helping to establish other congregations of
                    the denomination in the community.5 The new pastor came to his duties in the
                    Hoosier capital from a successful pastorate in 
                        Kansas City
                    , 
                        Missouri
                    . A newspaper man in 
                        Kansas City
                    , lamenting De La Matyr's departure, noted that while certain persons had
                    objected to some of the clergyman's pronouncements on public figures and issues, everyone
                    agreed that he was a man of courage and ability. Consolation for his leaving, said the journalist,
                    could be drawn from the knowledge that De La Matyr was going to "a larger place and a wider
                    field of usefulness."6
            
            The "wider field of usefulness" marked out for De La Matyr was scarcely discernible
                    when he arrived in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . His initial concern seems to have been almost exclusively for the spiritual welfare of
                    his new parish and the improvement of its program. The building serving Roberts Park stood
                    uncompleted in 1874. Occupying a pleasant wooded site at the corner of Vermont and Delaware streets
                    on 
                        Indianapolis
                    ’ near east side, the edifice was of imposing size and design but unfinished
                    inside above the ground floor.7 In January, 1875, the congregation voted to
                    complete the upper story of the structure which would house the main auditorium.8 De La Matyr pressed the matter, and in the spring the official board undertook a
                    subscription program to raise the necessary funds.9 Within a year the new

            In the course of De La Matyr's three years at Roberts Park the church made substantial
                    progress. The congregation increased from 542 to 693 full members, and, although still under a heavy
                    mortgage in 1877, it had made some headway in reducing its indebtedness.11 As
                    pastor of Roberts Park De La Matyr received a salary of $3,250 per year, the highest paid
                    to any of the approximately one hundred Methodist clergymen included in the denomination's
                    South-East Indiana Conference;12 but the amount was commensurate with the duties

                    of 1877, following a prolonged illness, can have seriously marred an otherwise satisfying term spent
                    by De La Matyr as pastor at Roberts Park.13 Methodist pulpit appointments were
                    frequently of short duration in the nineteenth century,14 and in the fall of
                    1877 the district conference assigned De La Matyr to

                    with the best wishes of that body. Noting that they were "unwillingly compelled to separate
                    from" the pastor, the church members, through their quarterly conference, commended him for
                    his ministry: 
                        We recognize in him a true Christian minister, living near the Cross, actuated by a profound
                            sense of his high calling, and whose intellectual attainments mark him, as worthy the
                            Pastorate of any congregation in the Church. ... and while we Separate in person, yet in
                            affection and church communion we trust to be united to him, wherever he may be sent in the
                            work of the Church.16
                  
                    
            
            When he undertook his new ministry at Grace Church, De La Matyr asserted that he would speak the
                    truth as he saw it, responsible to no man, not even to John Wesley himself. His conception of the
                    pastor's position appears somewhat overbearing, perhaps defensive; his sermons, he warned,
                    would not be entertaining but would be directed toward an elucidation of the lessons to be drawn
                    from the Bible:17 "He who seeks mainly to please and gathers his themes
                    from the suggestions of the people must be cringing and slavish. He who is conscious of being
                    God's messenger rises to a level far above such things."18 It
                    was well that the congregation at Grace Church was made aware of its pastor's position from
                    the beginning, for within a few months he became a major figure of controversy, outspoken far beyond
                    his pronouncements delivered from the pulpit at Roberts Park. Some of his contemporaries came to
                    regard him as a dangerous radical; a few referred to him as a "communist."19 Actually, however, De La Matyr defies easy categorization using terminology
                    meaningful either in his own day or at the present time. His sermons and other public statements,
                    widely reported in the newspapers of

                    mixture of generally traditional views concerning theology and ethical conduct, a suspicion of
                    certain minority groups, and yet a growing awareness of the social problems of the period. Finally,

                     there was simple love of country, intensified by his own
                    services in raising soldiers and as an army chaplain during the Civil War.20
            
            De La Matyr's views concerning the Deity, man, and scripture were probably not too
                    dissimilar from those of most Methodist clergymen of his day. Dealing ordinarily with familiar
                    themes—resurrection, the miracles of Christ, or the lives of biblical
                    characters—De La Matyr presented in his sermons a more or less orthodox Protestant
                    conception of Jehovah and His grand design for mankind and prescribed a rigid code of moral behavior
                    for Christians that included abstention from dancing, from attendance at the theater,21 and from even the moderate use of alcoholic beverages.22 Disdainful
                    of the ideas of men like Charles Darwin and Thomas Huxley, he insisted that man was the special
                    creature of God, not the product of an undirected evolutionary process.23 Only
                    with respect to his view of Jehovah as judge was there any substantial departure from an essentially
                    literal interpretation of the Bible. To De La Matyr the picture of a wrathful and vengeful god on
                    the one hand and a tender and loving savior on the other seemed incompatible within the context of
                    an harmonious Trinity. Lurking therein was what he termed the old "Persian theory"
                    of two separate deities, the one standing for goodness and symbolized by light, the other
                    epitomizing evil and symbolized by darkness. Rather than dwelling upon the imagined horrors of fire
                    and brimstone, De La Matyr preferred to see Jehovah's judgment as simply the separation of
                    evil men from the just and their banishment into darkness.24
            
            De La Matyr's sermons sometimes exhibited a pronounced hostility to Roman Catholicism. He
                    spoke of the role of Catholic priests as evidence of the "power of Satan"25 and discussed "Romanism" and its eventual destruction in
                    the context of various forces of evil and corruption destined to be overthrown.26 He admitted that 
                  
                     20 De La Matyr's views as expressed in his sermons are
                            further elaborated hereafter. A friendly biographer credited him with raising an artillery
                            battery and two regiments of Union soldiers during the Civil War and then serving as an.
                            army chaplain from 1862 to the end of the conflict. The information was taken from a sketch
                            of De La Matyr's life published originally in the

                     American Protestant churches were no more free from
                    "superstition" than were European Catholic churches,27 and he
                    credited Catholicism with contributing significantly to the aesthetic and cultural improvement of
                    its members, noting that "at all times the poorest may enter [a Catholic church] and kneel
                    before scenes of exquisite beauty."28 But for De La Matyr there was
                    something very dangerous about Catholicism in its effects upon treasured American institutions like
                    the sabbath and the public schools. It, or more specifically the Church's 
                        German
                     and Irish sons in America, he declared, intended to replace the day of rest and
                    consecration with a day of revelry and riotous pleasure.29 The schools, too,
                    were in danger, for atheism and Catholicism were mounting a combined assault on the system of public
                        education.30 Although he seemed to profess no enthusiasm for concerted
                    Protestant political action, De La Matyr warned that the "political unity of the Roman
                    Catholic Church, under a foreign potentate, and their determined purpose to destroy our State school
                    system, and the political unity of Germans for the purpose of destroying our Sabbaths, if continued,
                    will surely drive us to unite in political action for the purpose of saving these chief corner
                    stones of our liberties."31 De La Matyr's attitude toward
                    Catholicism was perhaps the least admirable aspect of his thought but one that would undergo a
                    profound transformation in the course of the pastor's later political activities.
            Corruption in government had become a major theme in De La Matyr's pronouncements from the
                    pulpit by 1876. His interest in the subject indicates at least a partial dissatisfaction with his
                    own Republican party, for in a sermon delivered early in March, 1876, he referred specifically to
                    "robbery of the government by whisky rings, and salary-grabs, and Indian
                        rings,"32 a scarcely veiled indictment of the Republican Ulysses S.
                    Grant administration. The pastor's denunciations of bribery and scandal in high places were
                    coupled, however, with an unfortunate tendency to see bad government as also in large measure the
                    product of a suffrage too carelessly extended. Although he did not call for restrictions to be
                    placed upon the franchise, De La Matyr clearly implied that certain classes of newcomers to the
                    electoral process were especially susceptible to manipulation by devious politicians. The former
                    slave and the newly arrived immigrant had obtained the right to vote, he thought, before they knew
                    how to

                     exercise the privilege properly, a situation that presented an
                    "overwhelming peril" to American institutions.33 The
                    nation's only hope lay in greater participation by other citizens, particularly Christians.
                    It was they who must help to train the ignorant in responsible citizenship, attend local political
                    gatherings to keep them out of the hands of demagogues, and then, above all, be present at the
                    polls, not only to vote but to keep a watchful eye on proceedings at the ballot box throughout
                    election day.34
            
            Good citizenship and Christian conduct were indistinguishable in the thinking of a man like De La
                    Matyr, for he conceived of America as having a special relationship with the Deity. The 
                        United States
                    ’ constitution he termed a "transcript" of God's
                    word, and the Republic's mission he defined as the development of "a people
                    combining all the races of men under one banner and under our God." According to De La
                    Matyr, the central event in American history was the Civil War, and he believed that Jehovah had
                    taken an intense interest in the outcome of that conflict.35 In defeating the
                    Confederacy, the Union not only eliminated slavery but, even more importantly, established as
                    permanent the American system of popular government: "Our system is no longer an
                    experiment. We have passed from the meekness and vacillation of experiment. With confidence we can
                    devote all our energies to the work God has given."36
            
            So long as he confined his concerns to biblical topics, good citizenship, and the need for better men
                    to fill public offices, De La Matyr apparently aroused little outright opposition to his views. In
                    the spring of 1878, however, he stepped boldly into the controversy over financial reform,
                    delivering a Sunday sermon at Grace Church on the evening of April 28, entitled "Remedy for
                    the Commune." The message, far from being a call for revolution, was designed to suggest
                    means for allaying social discord; however, De La Matyr referred to capital as the "power
                    to oppress" and claimed that those who possessed capital in the form of money had been able
                    to expropriate all other forms of property through their control over the nation's finances
                    since the Civil War. Asserting that "the majority" of Americans were impoverished
                    and deep in debt, De La Matyr observed gloomily: "The masses must have opportunity to
                    accumulate homes and property, or the horrors of communism are sure to be developed. There must be
                    an escape for them from the tyranny of capital, or they will wage war upon their oppressors. Such
                    war would be utter madness, but madness seizes despairing masses." His proposed solution

                     unhappy situation was the dispersal of the nation's
                    impoverished masses into the vast and fertile plains of the western states: "Between the
                    Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains there are farms cleared ready for the plow, or for the herd
                    without the plow, for every homeless man and woman."37
            
            It was not his remedy, presumably, which disturbed the critics of the pastor, for it comported fully
                    with some of America's most treasured beliefs with respect to the value of the western
                    lands as a "safety valve" for eastern unrest. Rather, it seems to have been his
                    reference to moneyed classes as "oppressors" and the spectre of mass violence that
                    he raised which incurred the displeasure of conservatives. It was ridiculous to declare that five
                    sixths of the population was penniless, observed the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News: "It is such wild and absurd assertions as these, made or reported,
                    that form the staple arguments for lying and howling demagogues." References to capital as
                    oppressive and tyrannical and to the masses as prepared to wage violence were "more like
                    communistic catch-phrases than words of wisdom." The best prescription for the current
                    unsettled economic conditions, continued the editor of the News, was simply
                    "natural adjustment and individual thrift and the counsel for the hour is submission to
                    law, not incendiary appeals about class oppression."38 The News also published a letter signed "Methodist," ostensibly from a
                    reader who agreed wth the position of the newspaper but who went farther in charging that De La
                    Matyr's sermon was "rank communism" and dangerous to the
                    community's well being.39 De La Matyr replied to the charges of his
                    critics in a sermon delivered to his congregation on the evening of Sunday, May 5. Disclaiming any
                    sympathy with communism, which he observed meant "ravishing, arson, murder and
                    anarchy," he insisted that his concern was only for some means to alleviate the current
                    situation of high unemployment and economic stagnation. The News had attacked him,
                    he said, because the editor of the journal was "intensely partisan on the side of the
                    moneyed classes."40
            
            The controversy between De La Matyr and the editor of the conservative Republican News was apparently crucial in determining the pastor's future political course.
                    Although he had been critical of Republican party excesses during the Grant administration, there
                    seems to be no indication that he was actually contemplating leaving the Republican party prior to
                    the spring of 1878. Then, however, he found a ready defender of his views in the

                     of the young Greenback party.41 The Sun had made only casual references to De La Matyr in the past, referring to him
                    once as a "church debt lifter"42 and on another occasion,
                    publicizing a speech of his to be delivered on behalf of the city's relief fund;43 but on May 4, 1878, it devoted a lengthy editorial to De La Matyr's
                    sermon on social unrest, endorsing him as one who knew the truth and rightly foretold the actions of
                    the masses should conditions remain unchanged.44
            
            For the moment, it seems, De La Matyr avoided any additional pronouncements upon the condition of
                    America's oppressed classes at the hands of capitalists; if he did comment upon this or
                    other topics close to the hearts of financial reformers, the local press failed to take note of it.
                    He was present, however, to deliver the invocation at the Greenback party's state
                    convention in 
                        Indianapolis
                     on May 22, 1878, and two months later, on July 24, the Greenbackers of
                    Indiana's seventh congressional district selected him unanimously as their nominee for the
                    national House of Representatives.45 In an interview the following day with a
                    reporter for the News De La Matyr insisted that he had agreed only reluctantly to
                    have his name presented to the district convention but that he would probably accept the nomination;
                    if so, he intended to "conduct the canvass on a plane becoming a Christian
                    minister." In the course of the interview De La Matyr admitted frankly that without the
                    support of the Democrats he faced certain defeat in the campaign. Claiming that he had made no
                    bargain with the Democratic leadership, he reported nevertheless that prominent Democrats had
                    assured him that he would receive their party's backing.46 On August 30
                    De La Matyr's expectations were fulfilled when the Democrats of the seventh district
                    formally endorsed his candidacy.47
            
            Although such cooperation between parties was not unusual in Indiana during this period,48 Republicans were quick to point out certain incongruities apparent in the
                    Democrats’ willingness to fall in line behind the Greenback clergyman. De La Matyr and

                     48 Democrats and Greenbackers cooperated in other races in Indiana in
                            1878, and in the twelfth district, Democrats and Republicans supported the same candidate
                            against the Greenback nominee for Congress. Thornbrough, Indiana in the Civil
                                War Era, 1850–1880, 309, 311.
               
                     favored a high degree of federal control over
                    economic institutions, whereas Democrats had traditionally opposed any tendencies toward a more
                    powerful central government. De La Matyr, moreover, had been outspoken in his criticism of Roman
                    Catholics, a group that comprised a large portion of the Democrats’ own constituency.49 Yet from the standpoint of political opportunism, the Democratic
                    party's decision to endorse De La Matyr was entirely understandable. John Hanna, the
                    incumbent Republican congressman, had carried the district by a margin of only fourteen hundred
                    votes in 1876;50 joint action by the Democrats and Greenbackers might well
                    redeem the district in 1878, particularly if the fusion nominee were one who could be expected to
                    attract a certain number of normally Republican voters.
            On the crucial currency and financial questions, De La Matyr's views differed more in degree
                    than in kind from those of his Republican opponent. Hanna was essentially a moderate, rather than a
                    conservative or "sound" money man. Like De La Matyr, he advocated the
                    remonetization of silver and believed that those federal bonds which were redeemable by contract in
                    "coin" should be payable in either gold or silver rather than in gold alone. Hanna
                    did not share De La Matyr's deep aversion to the National Banking System, but, like many
                    others in the Indiana Republican party, he opposed the national Republican administration's
                    policy of a forced return to the gold standard and contraction in the volume of legal tender paper
                    currency in circulation. On the latter point Hanna favored a modest increase in the volume of
                    greenbacks to a fixed level of four hundred million dollars and preservation of them as a permanent
                    portion of the nation's circulating medium, together with gold, silver, and the national
                    bank notes.51 De La Matyr, on the other hand, wished to eliminate the national
                    bank currency entirely, reserve gold and silver largely for use in foreign trade, and place primary
                    reliance for the nation's domestic currency needs upon the greenbacks, their volume to be
                    limited only by the requirements of commerce at any given time.52
            
            The campaign for the seventh district seat focused more upon the person and reputation of De La Matyr
                    than upon specific issues dividing him from Hanna. In referring to the power of capital to oppress

                     social conditions, the minister challenged prevailing views
                    concerning property rights and left himself open to repeated charges that he was a dangerous
                    radical. De La Matyr, said the Republican 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal, "preaches the fundamental doctrines of communism with as much
                    apparent conviction as he ever preached the gospel. ... Other people may call it what they please,
                    we call it communism, and it is none the less so because presented in decorous language and in the
                    dangerous disguise of calm argument."53 The Greenback candidate was a
                    "communist of the most dangerous type," a man who, while disparaging the use of
                    violence, was actually suggesting it as a course of action, warned the Reverend Thomas A. Goodwin,
                    another prominent local Methodist clergyman, speaking before the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Colored Republican Club.54
            
            An incident involving an alleged conversation between the pastor and his barber illustrates the type
                    of campaign waged against De La Matyr. In August the Journal reported that a
                    prominent local businessman had overheard the clergyman remark to his barber that he hoped to see
                    the day when the law would prevent any man from accumulating a fortune in excess of
                    $20,000 and that any surplus above that amount ought to be put to public uses. If the
                    story were true, the editor noted, De La Matyr "should wear a red flag in his
                        buttonhole."55 De La Matyr denied the story as did the barber,56 but James H. Baldwin, the businessman in question, insisted that while the
                    conversation was in confidential tones, he had distinctly heard the pastor utter his
                    "communistic sentiment."57 The Journal
                    subsequently acquired the statements of several other individuals, including a member of De La
                    Matyr's former congregation at Roberts Park, all to the effect that he had at one time or
                    another expressed such views with respect to property accumulation.58
            
            De La Matyr's critics were anxious to depict him not only as a radical extremist but also as
                    one who was not entirely aware of what he was saying. In part this latter desire derived from a
                    certain naivete

                     on the part of the clergyman, a tendency to speak without
                    checking his facts or perhaps to speak rather more broadly than the facts would justify in order to
                    emphasize his point. In any case, the result was to make him vulnerable to the charge of uttering
                    ignorant or irresponsible statements. For example, he had asserted, in commenting upon the
                    oppressions of the forces of capital in his controversial April 28 sermon, that
                    "five-sixths of our population are utterly penniless, and four-fifths have mortgaged all
                    their future labor,"59 an assessment easily dismissed by his opponents
                    as greatly overstated.60 Similarly, in the course of his congressional campaign
                    De La Matyr contrasted 
                        United States
                     financial policy with that of 
                        France
                     in the period following the Franco-Prussian War, claiming that 
                        France
                     had been able to pay her war debt without impoverishing her people, whereas the
                    American war debt remained unpaid, a burden upon the people of the 
                        United States
                    .61 As Republican editors were quick to point out, however, it was
                    the war indemnity to 
                        Germany
                     which the Parisian government had paid, a feat accomplished through borrowing from the
                    French people, thus contributing to a large national debt still unpaid.62 De La
                    Matyr later insisted that he had always understood that 
                        France
                     had paid her indemnity to 
                        Germany
                     not her entire national debt,63 but his protestations could not
                    remove the impression that he had spoken in haste on a matter he only imperfectly comprehended at
                    the time.
            Although De La Matyr had continued to meet his pulpit responsibilities during the campaign, critics
                    among his fellow ministers moved to force his retirement either from politics or the pastorate at
                    the September, 1878, annual session of the South-East Indiana Conference of the Methodist Church.
                    The session, an assembly of the clergymen in the conference, met in 
                        Jeffersonville
                     to transact various items of church business that included passing upon the character
                    and qualifications of the ministers in its jurisdiction and determining pulpit assignments. De La
                    Matyr's opponents thought it unlikely that a clergyman could perform his pastoral duties
                    satisfactorily if at the same time he attempted to participate extensively in secular affairs.
                    Clearly they expected him to withdraw from the congressional campaign or to request a
                    "location," that is, surrender his position as a parish minister. De La Matyr
                    informed the conference that he had not really expected to be elected when chosen to run for
                    Congress and had accepted the nomination out of a sense of sacrifice. "If my brethren judge
                    [that] I would be a disadvantage to them I will locate,"

                     he continued, "but I want them to understand if I am
                    elected I won't lose my conscience. I have not descended to the muddy pool of politics. ...
                    I expect to preach every Sabbath whether located or not. I can find plenty of ministerial work to do
                    and get more than twice over what I get at Grace church."64 Following
                    prolonged discussion De La Matyr agreed under pressure to request a location. The conference, in
                    voting to grant his petition, noted that its action should not be interpreted as casting any
                    reflection upon the pastor's personal character or his performance as a clergyman;
                    moreover, the conference declared it would welcome De La Matyr back to the active ministry whenever
                    "the reasons for requesting location shall have ceased."65
                    Although De La Matyr's 
                        Indianapolis
                     congregation petitioned the conference to reverse its decision and restore him to his
                    post as their pastor, the clerical body reportedly refused to take further action in the matter66 thereby terminating De La Matyr's brief association with Grace
                    Church.
            Greenbackers and Democrats interpreted the action of the conference as evidence of extreme
                    partisanship: De La Matyr had simply been driven from his pulpit because he chose to oppose the
                    Republican party.67 On the other hand, so far as voter sympathies were
                    concerned, the conference may have performed something of a service to De La Matyr in separating him
                    from his clerical post, for the pastor himself had endeavored to avoid any denominational trappings
                    surrounding his candidacy. He had not been nominated for Congress by the Methodist church, he told a
                    crowd at 
                        Martinsville
                     in August, and if elected he "would do just as much for a Mohammedan or
                    infidel as for a Methodist."68 Perhaps emboldened by the actions of the
                    ministerial conference, De La Matyr expanded his appeal on the 
                  
                     64

                            $2,000, substantially less than the $3,250 he had earned at Roberts
                            Park but exceeded in the conference in 1878 only by the salary of $2,750 paid to
                            the new pastor at Roberts Park, Jeremiah Bayliss, and the total salary and housing allowance

                     eve of the election promising that if he were sent to Congress,
                    he could legislate on behalf of both saloon keepers and temperance men, as well as Methodists,
                    Catholics, and agnostics.69
            
            A majority of those who voted in the seventh district race apparently agreed that the Methodist
                    preacher could be trusted to represent them. He carried three of the four counties in the district
                    defeating Hanna by a slim margin of 18,720 to 17,881 votes. Although he seems to have been
                    particularly attractive to rural voters, his appeal was apparently not limited to that constituency.
                    In 
                        Marion County
                    , for example, he defeated Hanna by a margin of nearly six hundred votes in the
                    townships but trailed him by only eighty votes in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the single major city in the congressional district.70
                    Interpreting the results as a victory over the forces of intolerance and bigotry, the new
                    congressman-elect expressed special gratitude to Irish Catholics for their support and promised that
                    he would not permit religious prejudice to influence his own actions in 
                        Washington
                    .71 Because Indiana throughout the 1870s scheduled its state and
                    congressional elections in October, De La Matyr was now free to work on behalf of third party
                    candidates in other states which held their contests in November. Traveling east, he campaigned for
                    Greenback tickets in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts during the remainder of October and filled
                    pulpits on Sundays as a visiting man of the cloth.72
            
            Because De La Matyr owed his victory substantially to the Democratic party's endorsement of
                    his candidacy, speculation developed that he would forsake the Greenbackers to vote and act as a
                    member of the Democrats’ own delegation in the House.73 De La Matyr
                    insisted, however, that he would not betray the Greenbackers,74 and throughout
                    his term of service in the Forty-Sixth Congress (1879–1881), he maintained his Greenback
                    identity. Seated on the floor of the House in close proximity to James B. Weaver and others in the
                    third party's small but vocal contingent, he participated fully in the activities of the
                    Greenback delegation.75
            
            Much of the new congressman's time was consumed in handling the personal requests of his
                    constituents, some of whom desired passage of private pension bills, while others submitted
                    petitions related

                     to a variety of matters ranging from important items of pending
                    legislation to the establishment of additional local postal routes.76 De La
                    Matyr attempted to look after the interests of his home city by introducing legislation to establish
                    a branch of the federal mint in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and to make the city a port of delivery to facilitate its import trade. The mint
                    proposal failed to pass, but the bill to make 
                        Indianapolis
                     a port of delivery, strongly supported by the city's board of trade, was
                    enacted and signed into law before the termination of the Forty-Sixth Congress.77 As a gesture to his Catholic constituents, De La Matyr introduced legislation authorizing
                    St. John's Church in 
                        Indianapolis
                     to import free of duty an altar from 
                        Italy
                    . The bill was passed by both houses and approved by the President early in 1880.78
            
            On at least two occasions De La Matyr was called upon to open sessions of the House of
                    Representatives with prayer.79 He also embellished his speeches and remarks with
                    religious allusions, for example, referring to the concentration of wealth as "the great
                    hinderance to the success of the gospel of Christ" and repeating Jesus’
                    pessimistic observation concerning the chances for a wealthy man to enter Paradise.80 De La Matyr's attitude toward churches was somewhat ambivalent, however; he
                    opposed the taxation of church property, citing the valuable services performed by religious
                    organizations in the area of education, but he described the pulpit and religious press of the
                    country as "largely on the side of the absorbers of the products of other men's
                        labor."81 So far as clergymen were concerned, he declared at one
                    point that, in his view, it was "not well to trust ministers any further [sic] than other men."82
            
            Although a freshman member of the legislative body, De La Matyr entered freely into debates before
                    the House, speaking at length on subjects related to the money question and submitting several items
                    of legislation concerning currency and financial reform. Relying primarily upon arguments developed
                    in his 1878 congressional canvass, he depicted a 
                        United States
                     rapidly degenerating to the level of conditions in Europe where, he said, the lords of
                    capital largely determined the course of nations. The economic policies pursued by the federal
                    government since the Civil War, he charged, had been disastrous to America's producing
                    classes, creating conditions less tolerable than those under which the black slaves lived in the
                    antebellum South. Calling attention to his own service as a chaplain with the Union army, De La
                    Matyr insisted that the old sectional issues were no

                     longer relevant, and that continued reference to them by
                    Republican and Democratic orators was only a device to divert attention from the economic crisis
                    confronting America. Protesting his own aversion to violence as a means for social change, he warned
                    nevertheless that the poor would not forever stoically bear their misery.83
            
            De La Matyr offered several pieces of proposed legislation in pursuit of Greenback party objectives.
                    Among these were bills to provide for payment of the interest on the federal debt in greenbacks,
                    while refunding the debt itself in greenbacks, and to eliminate national bank notes as a circulating
                    medium replacing them with greenbacks.84 The legal tenders, he argued, were far
                    superior as a means of exchange to either precious metals or bank currency, for they were less
                    cumbersome than specie and cost the government practically nothing to issue or replace when worn.
                    Moreover, since money was but a creature of law, its legal tender qualities historically determined
                    by governments, authority for issuing the nation's currency should be vested directly in
                    the federal government alone rather than permit private banking institutions, which were frequently
                    unresponsive to the public's monetary needs, to emit a major portion of the currency.85 The National Banking System was repugnant to De La Matyr not only because of
                    its alleged malevolent influence upon the economy but also because it gathered what he defined as a
                    double measure of interest on its holdings of federal bonds. All national banks were required to own
                    federal securities as a part of their capital, but against these holdings, the banks could issue
                    currency up to ninety per cent of the value of those same bonds. The banks therefore received not
                    only the interest paid them by the federal government on the bonds they owned but also the interest
                    paid by borrowers of the banks’ currency in their operations as commercial lending
                        institutions.86
            
            More controversial than any of De La Matyr's own proposals was a scheme authored by a
                    Kentuckian, John Chiles, and introduced on his behalf by the Indiana congressman.87 De La Matyr later said he presented Chiles’ petition because he believed it was
                    at least worthy of consideration by the House Committee on Banking and Currency, to which it was
                        referred.88 Chiles’ plan envisioned a vast program of

                    one billion dollars in greenbacks and undertaken both by the federal government itself and by
                    private corporations supplied with federal loans. It would serve the double purpose of placing in
                    circulation a substantial issue of greenbacks and at the same time of putting large numbers of
                    unemployed persons to work on projects like river improvements and flood control.89 De La Matyr insisted on the floor of Congress and later in an address delivered to an

                     audience that he had introduced the proposals only at the request of Chiles and that,
                    while he approved of the general idea, he did not endorse that portion of the plan involving loans
                    to private companies.90 His opponents, however, held him responsible for the
                    scheme and took delight in ridiculing it; one Republican member suggested that the money was to be
                    used "for building up all the old, worn-out canals and burst-up railroads in the
                    West" while another claimed that a group of his own constituents desired funds to be
                    appropriated "for the laudable purpose of constructing a narrow-gauge air-line railway to
                    the moon, to ascertain whether or not that luminary is made of green cheese."91
                    
                        Indianapolis
                    ’ Democratic journal, the Sentinel, was critical as well:
                    De La Matyr's bill appeared "wild and visionary in the extreme," the
                    editor commented.92
            
            The Forty-Sixth Congress enacted none of the legislation sponsored by De La Matyr dealing with the
                    money question.93 Still, in spite of his inability to influence federal
                    financial policy, he could draw some satisfaction from his role as one of the leading figures in the
                    Greenback delegation. In March, 1880, he willingly accepted renomination by the Greenbackers of the
                    seventh district, remarking that he had "no misgivings whatever" as to his duty
                    and promising to work even more diligently for his constituents if elected to a second term.94
            
            De La Matyr's chances for reelection in 1880 were contingent upon his success in maintaining
                    the backing of the coalition which had supported him two years earlier, but the Democrats were no
                    longer

                     93 De La Matyr introduced the following items of legislation related
                            to financial reform in the Forty-Sixth Congress: a bill to replace all National Bank
                            currency with greenbacks, a bill to provide that municipal debts might be funded in
                            greenbacks, a bill to employ greenbacks in a public works program, and a bill to provide for
                            paying the interest on the federal debt and refunding the debt itself in greenbacks. Congressional Record, 46 Cong., 1 Sess., 962, 1059.

                     enthusiastic in his behalf. In Congress he had voted with the
                    Democrats on a controversial army appropriations bill,95 but he had not
                    supported their candidate for Speaker of the House96 and had been sharp in his
                    criticism of both major parties during House proceedings.97 His actions for the
                    most part, therefore, were apparently not sufficiently in keeping with Democratic party objectives
                    to warrant an endorsement.98 The contest in 1880 thus became a three cornered
                    race involving Stanton J. Peelle, the Republican candidate, Casabianca Byfield, the Democratic
                    nominee, and De La Matyr.99
            
            The Greenback incumbent canvassed enthusiastically hitting hard at the old issues,100 but his candidacy was overshadowed by the battle between Byfield and Peelle and by the
                    larger contest for the Presidency, also a feature of the campaign of 1880. For a time Republicans
                    speculated that Byfield would withdraw in favor of De La Matyr in exchange for Greenback concessions
                    in other races,101 but such an arrangement, if ever contemplated, was not
                    consummated. In August De La Matyr proposed a series of joint public debates with his opponents, but
                    neither Byfield nor Peelle apparently accepted the challenge.102 An additional
                    factor complicated De La Matyr's task, for his district had been redrawn since 1878 and was
                    now partially unfamiliar to him. The seventh district now included only Marion County (Indianapolis)
                    of his former constituency together with two new counties, Hancock and Shelby.103
            
            Indiana's Greenback vote declined sharply in 1880 from the level attained two years earlier.
                    The state ticket received substantially less than half as many votes in 1880 as in 1878, and
                    Greenback representation in the new state legislature was reduced from fourteen to three. The
                    Republican party, which carried Indiana narrowly in both the presidential contest and in the state
                    races, was victorious in the

                            commented that although the Greenbackers had renominated De La Matyr for Congress, he was
                            inclined to believe that De La Matyr, "after March, 1881, will be urgently called
                            to reenter upon his great life work of preaching." Ibid., March

                    votes to 16,806 for Byfield and only 2,135 for De La Matyr.104
            
            Disappointed in his unsuccessful bid for reelection, De La Matyr promised to continue his work by
                    devoting his time over the next two years to lecturing on the topic of "political
                        economy."105 When the Forty-Sixth Congress adjourned in March,
                    1881, he set out on a speaking tour that carried him from Maine to Missouri, reportedly drawing
                    large and enthusiastic audiences including one estimated at seven thousand which heard him conduct
                    the Sunday morning services held on July 3 in conjunction with a Greenback camp meeting in Lansing,
                        Michigan.106
            
            De La Matyr was in need of more than large audiences, however, for his family responsibilities had
                    grown in the past year. In June, 1880, he married for the third time. The new Mrs. De La Matyr, the
                    former Mrs. W. C. Sylla, was a Brockport, New York, widow and teacher. She brought to the marriage
                    three daughters, and together with De La Matyr's own son from his second marriage, they
                    comprised a large family to support.107 The Greenback Lecture Bureau had planned
                    to maintain De La Matyr and others in the field through the sale of reprints of their speeches, but
                    results in this regard were not encouraging.108 The Greenback party was rapidly
                    declining, its organization deteriorating in all but a few states; crowds of the faithful might
                    still gather to hear the old gospel of paper money proclaimed, but reformers generally were turning
                    to other issues, like "anti-monopolism" and, eventually, "free
                        silver."109
            
            Only meager information has been located concerning De La Matyr's whereabouts and activities
                    between 1881 and 1884 although one source places him in Florida during that period as the proprietor
                    of a plantation.110 Ultimately, he returned to his former calling. Readmitted to
                    the full time Methodist ministry in September, 1884, he served as the pastor for two Denver,
                    Colorado, congregations: the Lawrence Street Methodist Episcopal Church from 1884 to 1886 and the
                    Evans Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church from 1886 to 1888. In 1889 he was listed as an
                    "endowment agent" for Denver University,

                     but in that same year he moved to Akron, Ohio, where he became
                    pastor of First Methodist Church, a congregation of more than nine hundred members.111 Although retired from active politics, De La Matyr apparently never abandoned the
                    doctrines of Greenbackism. In February, 1892, he addressed the Summit County, Ohio, Evangelical
                    Association on the topic "Christian Socialism." Confining his remarks almost
                    entirely to the financial question, he depicted a grasping money power and rehearsed its activities
                    over the past thirty years in gathering wealth and power into its hands. "There has got to
                    be a revolution here," he warned with the old fervor. "Be assured of it,
                    it's coming. There's peril in the air. You cannot permanently make slaves of the
                    American freemen." To alleviate the republic's distress De La Matyr prescribed a
                    large dose of legal tender paper currency, administered gradually and to a final figure of sixty
                    dollars per capita in circulation.112
            
            De La Matyr's address to the county evangelical association was apparently his last major
                    pronouncement on the currency question. He died three months later in Akron on May 17, 1892, at age
                    sixty-five. His death, attributed to cancer of the bladder, followed an extended illness of several
                    weeks and a final period of intense suffering. A large number of persons attended the funeral
                    services where the remains of the deceased lay surrounded by floral tributes from religious and
                    military organizations, together with various objects that represented in rather heavy symbolism the
                    many facets of his career, including a Bible, an army canteen, a shock of wheat emblematic of a
                    fruitful life, and a stack of rifles beneath Confederate and Union flags.113
            
            Remembered in death as "Christian, sage, preacher and reformer,"114 Gilbert De La Matyr had pursued a career touched with responsibilities not typically
                    associated with a man of the cloth, nor universally appreciated as compatible with the profession of
                    a clergyman. For De La Matyr, however, there was no conflict of interests

                     or loyalties apparent in his activities. Conceiving of America
                    as a nation special in the sight of God, he obviously saw nothing reprehensible in blending
                    political and clerical talents in a life of public service.
            As a controversial but highly regarded member of the Indianapolis clergy, De La Matyr probably
                    brought to his adopted Greenback party a certain degree of respectability that contributed to its
                    legitimacy in the eyes of the voters. In Congress he favored programs that were ridiculed by his
                    opponents as impractical or dangerous but from a later perspective appear only somewhat ahead of
                    their time. His subsequent return to the ministry seems not to have been made at the expense of his
                    political convictions, for he remained a vocal currency reformer at the end of his life. In a larger
                    sense De La Matyr's career reveals a comparatively early perception by a clergyman of some
                    of the problems associated with large concentrations of wealth and the plight of disadvantaged
                    classes in the new urban and industrial order.
         
         
         
            Elmo Arnold Robinson: A New England Minister in Indiana, 1914–1917
            
                    Pamela J. Bennett
                
            The document which follows sketches and evaluates the thirty-three month Universalist pastorate of
                    the Reverend Elmo Arnold Robinson in Anderson and Pendleton, Indiana. It is a recollection in
                    maturity of a period of youthful beginnings. Robinson came to Indiana from a New England background.
                    He was born in Portland, Maine, on January 1, 1887, and was reared and educated mainly in the East.
                    He had two years experience in parish ministry before he arrived in Anderson.1
                    This memoir tells of his reactions to the Middle West, his generally strained relationships with all
                    but a few of his Anderson and Pendleton ministerial colleagues, and his own growing and changing
                    opinions. This is the personal history; Robinson's experience demonstrates some interesting
                    human and social interactions. In addition, the memoir provides a slice of local and religious
                    history which increases its worth as an historical document. Of particular interest are
                    Robinson's comments about the problems of rural churches in general and about his own
                    denomination. Robinson made his initial contribution as an historian of Universalism during this
                        period;2 the memoir indicates the impetus toward that end.
            This item first came to the attention of the Indiana Magazine of History staff in
                    October, 1969, when Robinson indicated that he was writing his autobiography and wanted to publish
                    portions of it. In December, 1969, a draft of "A New England Minister in Indiana"
                    was submitted for review.3 This first draft differs markedly from the present
                    version in organization and contains less detail about people and activities. Robinson omitted
                    several things in revision: a description of his Anderson apartment, a few more details about the
                    1916 Chicago summer and the 1915 western trip, and a few biting remarks about the Anderson clergy.
                    One episode which Robinson cut when he revised his essay seems important enough to a
                    characterization of both Robinson and the Anderson situation to include here: 
                        When we were getting into World War One, I offered a resolution expressing (as I recall it)
                            something of the Christian witness for peace even in time of war. It was adopted rather
                            enthusiastically. Sarber said a Baptist could have written it. But it was held over a month
                            for final approval. At the second meeting 
                        
                           1 According to records of the Pendleton Universalist church
                                    now in the Indiana Division, Indiana State Library (Indianapolis), Robinson was
                                    ordained in June, 1912. "Pendleton Universalist Church Records" (4
                                    vols.), III, 67. Robinson graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                                    (Boston) and from St. Lawrence University (Canton, N. Y.) with a B.D. in 1912. See

                             Brundage made one of his infrequent appearances to
                            oppose it. Everyone but Gerberding and myself backed down. Even he generously offered to
                            make the vote unanimous, but I held out. Nevertheless, a few days later I went with Sarber
                            and others to a meeting of ministers in Indianapolis called by the Governor.4
                  
                    This incident occurred in May, 1917; the repudiation and his public announcement of
                    resignation are both in the Anderson Herald of May 15. Although Robinson had
                    previously indicated an intention to resign, the timing may suggest the proverbial last straw in his
                    Anderson endeavors.
            Robinson spent two years in Ohio after leaving Anderson. The first, he was minister at Plain City and
                    Woodstock and attended the Ohio State University in Columbus "with a plan of earning a
                    doctorate in American history and a thesis on Universalist history. ... The second year ... [he]
                    substituted for Woodstock a job as bookkeper [sic] and teller in a bank. This
                    meant ... [giving] up the university to earn a living in that war year."5
            
            After Ohio Robinson moved west and held various positions in churches and educational institutions:
                    assistant minister, Unitarian Church. San Diego (1919–1921); minister, Unitarian Church,
                    Palo Alto (1921–1926); professor of philosophy, and at retirement department head, San
                    Jose State College (1928–1958); minister and minister emeritus, Los Alamos (New Mexico)
                    Unitarian Church (1959–1962, 1962–1972). He taught summers at several
                    different institutions: University of Oregon (Eugene), San Diego State, Fresno State, Western
                    Washington State (Bellingham), and Starr King School for the Unitarian Ministry (San Francisco,
                        California).6 A chapter outline of Robinson's autobiography also
                    indicates "Two interludes" between Palo Alto and San Jose State
                    College—the American Civil Liberties Union in San Francisco and high school teaching in
                    Susanville, California.7 Elmo Arnold Robinson died at the age of eightyfive on
                    the evening of January 17, 1972, in Los Alamos.8

                        draft. The resolution is in the Anderson Herald, May 11, 1917, and deals with
                        the relationship of church and state in the matter of war. It was reportedly written in response
                        to the subsequently held meeting of Indiana ministers about the war announced by Governor James
                        P. Goodrich. The resolution was repudiated as Robinson, indicates, Ibid., May
                        15, 1917. The Goodrich meeting on May 15 in Indianapolis endorsed President Woodrow
                        Wilson's policy and offered support. Ibid, May 16, 1917. O. B. Sarber

            A New England Minister in Indiana, 1914–19171
            
            The influence of a few words may persist through many years. In response to my question, "Do
                    you have anything on Universalism in Indiana ?" the librarian at the Indiana
                    State Library [Indianapolis] replied, "No, why don't you write
                    something?" This conversation occurred, I believe, on August 27, 1915. Its
                    outcome was an essay, "Universalism in Indiana," which appeared in two successive
                    issues of volume 13 of the Indiana Magazine of History. Now fifty years later I
                    propose to recount my experiences during three years in Indiana as a Universalist minister. During
                    the intervening years those words of that librarian have been responsible for several essays and a
                    forthcoming book on the history of my denomination.2
            
            
                    The "I" who came to Indiana
                
            My memories of Universalist churches go back to infancy in Portland, Maine, continuing during youth
                    in Rochester, New York, and Boston, Massachusetts. Graduating from MIT, I reverted to an earlier
                    dream of studying for the ministry. To this I devoted three years. Although city-bred my first
                    parishes were among farming people at the eastern end of Lake Ontario.3
            
            
               
                  1 The memoir which follows was printed from a typescript submitted by Elmo
                        Arnold Robinson for publication in the Indiana Magazine of History. This
                        typescript version contains six footnotes; the content of some of these notes has been included
                        in the present footnotes. When quoted, these notes have been indicated as "original
                        note." The text published here, with the following exceptions, reproduces faithfully
                        Robinson's typescript as submitted. The spacing and type face of subheadings has been
                        altered. Obvious typographical errors have been corrected; [sic] is used to
                        indicate errors not obviously typographical even though Robinson, had he lived to complete work
                        on the memoir, doubtless would have corrected such items. The editor has added bracketed
                        material for minor spelling corrections, expansion of names, and brief clarification of items in
                        the text. Unless otherwise indicated correspondence cited in the notes is in the files of the
                                Indiana Magazine of History. Robinson's papers, presumably
                            including the diary mentioned in this memoir, are now located at the University of Oregon

                  3 An introductory article in the city newspaper includes the following
                        information about Robinson: "Rev. Robinson is a graduate of the department of biology
                        and public health at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston. Soon after leaving there
                        he began a three years’ theological course which he divided among three different
                        seminaries, Tufts, Union and [St. Lawrence at] Canton. For two years he was the minister of the
                        Universalist churches at Henderson and Ellisburg, New York. During the past year he was
                        assistant in physiology in the
            
            
            Subsequently after a year as a laboratory assistant at Wellesley College, I again sought a pastorate.
                    The board of the Indiana Universalist Convention communicated with Dr. Lewis B. Fisher of Ryder
                    Divinity School (now Meadville-Ryder) at Chicago,4 seeking a man to serve
                    churches in Anderson and Pendleton. Upon his recommendation I was hired, sight unseen. This
                    arrangement now seems impulsively entered into on both sides. I was still a bookish person, assuming
                    that other people would be interested in whatever I had found interesting in my reading. I had been
                    west of Buffalo only once, and then only to Akron [Ohio]. I had no idea of what life was like in the
                    middle west.
            Nevertheless I was game to find out. I had plans for marriage. I wanted a job. To move so far from my
                    native New England was a challenging adventure. I accepted. On September 4th, 1914, with my bride,
                    Olga Kelsey5 of Fort Covington, New York, I arrived to begin my residence in
                    Anderson. Meanwhile I had made a brief visit there, had met a few of the people, and had leased a
                    Langell Apartment on [126] West 12th Street.
            
                    The Indiana to which I came
                
            The Indiana which I came to know was largely limited to the area of which Anderson was the center. As
                    we had no automobile, all our expeditions afield were by public transportation. Facilities for this
                    were excellent. Our two railroads gave excellent service in four directions, with one branch line to
                    the south. When visiting my parents in Oak Park [Illinois], we had a choice of three rail routes to
                    Chicago. Interurban electric lines took one quickly to nearby communities.

                            founded in 1851 in Galesburg, Illinois. In 1917 Ryder moved to Chicago (the college
                            remaining in Galesburg), and affiliated with the Divinity School of the University of
                            Chicago. In 1928 Ryder officially united with Meadville Theological School, which had
                            recently moved to Chicago from Meadville, Pennsylvania. Lombard College itself closed in
                            1930. By virtue of this union, Meadville became the theological department of Lombard

                     It was a simple matter to spend an hour, an evening, a day in
                    Pendleton. Indianapolis was easily accessible.6
            
            Anderson was a city of small factories. Several years earlier, so I was told, it had received an
                    influx of cheap labor from the south. From our centrally located apartment we could walk without
                    difficulty to any part of the city. Few of its inhabitants, I suppose, had ever attended
                    college—probably none from my congregation. There was a good public library, a Lyceum
                    course of lectures and concerts, and an adequate daily newspaper, The Anderson
                    Herald. A friendly editor accepted my items without question, and sometimes even asking me to
                    report a lecture or concert for him. So far as I can recall, the schools were good.7
            
            Anderson citizens were chiefly factory workers and their families, served by a number of business and
                    professional people. There were some good physicians, one of whom, a Dr. Miley, we chose.8 Specializing among them was just beginning, with the so-called specialists
                    still in process of learning their trades. The city's most popular physcian used to
                    describe his cases to a knowledgeable pharmacist, asking his advice about what to prescribe.9 I had a low impression 
                  
                     6 Robinson's original note indicates: "To Chicago
                            direct via Pennsylvania; or through Indianapolis and thence via Monon or New York
                            Central." According to a contemporary publication by the Chamber of Commerce,
                            "Anderson is situated on the main divisions of the P. C. C. & St. L. Ry.,
                            The Big Four Division of the New York Central Lines, The Central Indiana Railway (leading
                            direct to coal fields) and the Union Traction Company of Indiana, which operates an
                            interurban system over the entire state and is connected with other interurban lines
                            throughout Ohio, Michigan and Illinois." Henry R. Fish, Illustrated

                     7 According to Illustrated Anderson the Public
                            Library was made possible by funds from Andrew Carnegie and the city combined. It was
                            dedicated April 20, 1905. In 1915 holdings reportedly were 24,000 volumes and there was
                            "an average of 201 books loaned each day, besides the loan of books to public
                            schools" (p. 7). Illustrated Anderson also indicates that the
                            public schools are "noted throughout the United States. Anderson has 12 splendidly
                            equipped school buildings that house over 6,000 pupils" (p. 6); this included
                            Manual Training High School. Apparently the lyceum course was initiated shortly after
                            Robinson arrived in Anderson. The Redpath Lyceum Bureau and the Anderson Ministerial
                            Association planned to manage jointly such a project early in September, and season tickets
                            were advertised by early October. Anderson Herald, September 15, October
                            7, 1914. Lyceum announcements occur in various issues throughout the next thirty months. The
                                Herald was begun in 1868 and went through several owners until it was
                            purchased and modernized by Wallace B. Campbell in 1895. Campbell was aided by E. C. Toner
                            editorially and Charles H. Neff on the business aspects. It reportedly was a Republican
                            paper and ranked "high in the newspaper field. Mr. Toner has continued to serve as
                            editor, since first assuming charge of this department." James J. Netterville,

                     of the courts, where some of the attorneys sat with feet on
                    courtroom tables, and proceedings seemed disgracefully lax.
            There were several churches, employing perhaps twenty or thirty ministers, including two or three
                    Negroes. A delightful memory is that of evening singing in one of the Negro churches near our
                    residence. The predominant sect was Christian, with Baptists and Methodists as runners-up. The
                    leading Christian Church was near us, with the First Methodist across the street from us. Socially
                    the church to belong to was the Presbyterian, or else the less pretentious Episcopalian. An
                    integrated city ministerial association met monthly for programs and luncheons.10
            
            Pendleton was something else. It had a rural setting and yet was a compact village. Only one of my
                    congregation, Isaac Jones, actually lived on a farm. To me the people seemed more typically Hoosiers
                    than did those of Anderson, and their community on the whole was a cut above the larger city in
                    cultural standards.11
            
            
                    Universalism in Indiana
                
            My essay of fifty years ago12 sketched the history of our movement in the state.
                    Here I shall very briefly condense that story. After the United States gained its independence,
                    westward migration brought into the Ohio Valley from the Atlantic states settlers of divergent
                    religious convictions. The region was a field of rival sectarian competition, with lengthy and
                    bitter debates. Among these newcomers were many Universalists, both laymen and preachers. The
                    latter, often restless, tended not to stay with the churches which they had gathered. They had come
                    on their own initiative, without support from older societies to the east. Some of their Indiana
                    churches 
                  
                     10
                            Illustrated Anderson indicates that there were thirty-five churches (p.
                            6). John L. Forkner lists with addresses twenty-eight churches in Anderson in History of Madison County Indiana: A Narrative Account of Its Historical Progress, Its
                                People and Its Principal Interests (3 vols., Chicago, 1914), I, 247. There were
                            generally fifteen to twenty churches mentioned in the column of church announcements which
                            appeared each Saturday in the Herald. Ministerial Association reports
                            appeared regularly in the Herald following the meetings.
                  
                     11 Forkner indicates that Pendleton was easily accessible by both rail
                            and interurban. "The Pendleton of the present day has a modern school building,
                            four churches, a weekly newspaper, well paved streets, two banks, several well equipped
                            mercantile establishments and a number of handsome residences." Forkner, History of Madison County, I, 125. A column featuring Pendleton news
                            appeared frequently—often every issue—in the Herald.
                            There are abundant references to various kinds of cultural activities. Census figures for
                            the two locations indicate a substantial difference in size and strong growth for Anderson
                            in the decade during which Robinson spent three years there: Anderson, 22,476, Pendleton,
                            1,293, in 1910; Anderson, 29,767, Pendleton, 1,244, in 1920. U.S., Thirteenth

                     12 This refers to "Universalism in Indiana"
                            published in the Indiana Magazine of History in 1917. The dating here
                            places composition of this memoir as early as 1967. Robinson obviously wrote over a period
                            of several years, and his revisions update the article to 1970.
               
                     were in cities; many were in small towns or rural areas, where
                    supporters were too few to employ a resident minister, even though money and labor might provide a
                    suitable or even attractive building.
            When I arrived in Indiana many of these societies were practically dormant, although still listed in
                    the denominational yearbook. Usually they retained enough vitality to keep their buildings in repair
                    and to bring in a clergyman for weddings, funerals, and a few services each year. There were but few
                    ministers employed full time: Will Couden in Indianapolis, Edward G. Mason at Muncie, John Carpenter
                    followed by Charles E. Petty at Logansport. H. C. Beckett and also Leon and Martha Jones were giving
                    part-time help to rural churches. A Rev. Mr. Wicks in Indianapolis was the sole Unitarian minister
                    in the state.13 My diary records visiting churches nearby at Oaklandon and
                    Castleton, and at unidentified Cunot and Devon.14 To the north I called on
                    Universalist families in Alexandria, Summitville, Jonesboro, and Marion. In the farm country to the
                    south around Markleville there were clusters of Universalist families, some of whom were identified
                    with the church at Pendleton. None of them thought to use their new automobiles to attend on Sunday.
            What had been happening was a decline in rural churches. Concerned leaders in all denominations were
                    trying to counter the trend. Previously I had attended Country Life Institutes at St. Lawrence and
                        Cornell.15 Our denomination, being strongly rural, was losing churches.
                    These losses were a factor in the later consolidation with the Unitarians.16 In
                    1914 I did not fully grasp the situation, still considering our rural churches to be a field for
                    religious renewal.
            
               
                  13 Prank Scott Corey Wicks (1868–1952) was ordained a Unitarian
                        minister in 1895. He was installed as pastor of All Souls Unitarian Church, Indianapolis, in
                        1905. Who Was Who in America, III, 914. Jacob Piatt Dunn praises Wicks for his
                        contributions to religion and the community in an extensive article in Greater
                            Indianapolis: The History, the Industries, the Institutions, and the People of a City of
                            Homes (2 vols., Chicago, 1910), II, 1078–79. The other ministers Robinson
                        mentions have not been identified except for full names and dates of ordination, given in
                        parentheses: William Coudon (1902), Edward Oilman Mason (1892), John Randolph Carpenter (1887),
                        Charles Ellsworth Petty (1899), Henry C. Beckett (1896), Leon P. Jones (1894), Martha Garner
                        Jones (1894). Neil R. Jordahl to Pamela J. Bennett, April 7, 1972.
               
                  14 Mention of these towns has been located in various places including
                        Robinson's "Universalism in Indiana," 9. Apparently they no longer
                        exist as towns, and further information about them has not been located. A Cunot in northern
                        Owen County does, however, appear on various older maps of Indiana.
               
                  15 Robinson reported on these two conferences in the Universalist Leader: "Country Life Institute at Canton, N. Y.," XVI
                        (January 4, 1913), 12–13; "Country Church Conference at Cornell,"
                        XVI (March 8, 1913), 303–304. This movement was widespread, and concern apparently
                        was officially recognized when Theodore Roosevelt appointed the Commission on Country Life in
                        August, 1908. L. H. Bailey, The Country-Life Movement in the united States

                  16 This merger occurred in several stages. In 1953 the denominations, the
                        American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America, formed
            
            
            Officers of the Indiana Universalist Convention in 1915 were president, John F. Clifford of
                    Connersville; vice-president, Clay Whitely of Muncie; secretary, Nellie Stouder of Muncie;
                    treasurer, Melvin A. Beagle of Oaklandon; trustees, Orlando Moseley of Peru, Andrew Taff of Madison,
                    and Peter Disher of Indianapolis.
            
                    My tasks
                
            On this background I shall try to describe my three years in Indiana, the years of a bookish man now
                    given to impulsive activities, of a well-educated man unprepared for the tasks confronting him.
                    First the Anderson story, although programs there were often repeated at Pendleton.
            My formal installation was arranged for September 20th.17 Already I had plunged
                    into the typical routine of the conventional ministry: preaching services, Sunday School, and
                    pastoral calling. The only auxilliary [sic] organization was a Ladies Aid. Now and
                    again I gathered a youth group, a men's club, a boy's club, and a study club.
                    Interest in these was slight. They were short-lived. But the boys and I managed one camping trip to
                        Idlewold.18
            
            An early Universalist organization in Anderson in 1841 had left no impression on the city. The new
                    group (1896) had had one previous pastor, J. E [dward] Haffner, who had since left the ministry for
                    a business career in Birmingham, Alabama. I met him when on two occasions he returned to visit his
                    former parishioners. His leadership had led to the purchase of a small building, partly paid for, at
                    214 West 6th Street.19 It was an unattractive dwelling with three rooms,
                    arranged for temporary religious use.
            
               the Council of Liberal Churches (Universalist-Unitarian) which "brought together the
                        religious education, public relations, and some of the publishing activites of the two
                        denominations." In 1956 a merger commission was formed, and in 1961 a true
                        consolidation resulted in the Unitarian Universalist Association. Ernest Cassara, ed., Universalism in America: A Documentary History (Boston, 1971),

                        Department of Natural Resources and his wife "have the hazy recollection that there was
                        an Idlewold picnic and recreation facility near Pendleton at the time of World War I."

                  19 The Anderson Herald indicates that "The
                        Universalist Church has been without a pastor since the departure last winter of Rev. F. D.
                        Adams, during whose pastorate the church purchased the present temporary quarters at 214 West
                        Sixth street." September 4, 1914. Robinson has indicated that Haffner left in 1909 and
                        that Prank D. Adams, located at Indianapolis, also preached at Anderson; Adams left Indiana in
                        1914. Robinson, "Universalism in Indiana," 182, 178. Forkner indicates that
                        the Anderson Universalist church had not been strong enough to erect a church and met at 710

               ANDERSON UNIVERSALISTS OUTSIDE WEST SIXTH STREET BUILDING, ANDERSON, INDIANA, C.
                            AUTUMN, 1914
               Courtesy Elmo A. Robinson.
            
            
            My first task seemed to be to make Universalism known in the city. One method was to rent slides for
                    illustrated lectures, sometimes about places of which I knew little. But after the summer of 1915,
                    described below, I could talk about the San Francisco Exposition and Glacier National Park. For such
                    lectures the press gave good publicity.20
            
            Irregularly other programs were presented. The Presbyterians lent their auditorium for a concert by a
                    Universalist octette from Muncie. We had a lawn party with a once-act [sic] play.
                    We manned a booth at the Anderson Free Fair.21 Wicks came from Indianapolis to
                    deliver his oft repeated lecture on "Good Men in Hell." Rev. Frank Adams, already
                    known in this area, returned to Indiana to speak for us. For several weeks I issued a printed
                    four-page throw-away paper, The Prod to Progress, paid for by advertising. It
                    featured news of our church, announced my sermons, and supplied information about our point of
                        view.22 I took an impish delight in knowing that it must irritate my
                    orthodox colleagues. My wife became genuinely interested in poor families in the Ohio Avenue
                    neighborhood. She started a Sunday School among them, somehow finding money for a small building.23
            
            In those years our denomination was promoting "Universalist Evangelism." A week or
                    more of widely publicized meetings would be announced, usually at the Easter season, from which the
                    emotional sensationalism of the usual revival was eliminated. The purpose was to renew and expand
                    moral insights, communicate Universalist teachings, and secure new members. For such services I had
                    the assistance of visiting ministers: Edward Mason, Charles Petty, [E.] Dean Ellenwood, George
                    Baner, and Wesley Price. Resulting additions to our membership were few, but enough to encourage
                        us.24
            
            
               
                  20 For example, the Pendleton church was to host an illustrated lecture
                        series on six Tuesday nights on six European countries and their people. Ibid., February 17, 1915. "Ten Good Times Ahead" was the name given a
                        series of Friday evening illustrated talks, lectures, and social evenings directed by Robinson
                        and others at the Pendleton Universalist church, Ibid., October 7, 1915. There
                        was occasional followup publicity.
               
                  21 Presumably this refers to the Madison County Free Fair which had
                        reportedly four successful days after opening in Anderson on September 1, 1915. Ibid., September 1, 1915; see also issues for succeeding days.
               
                  22 See reproductions of one issue, September 4, 1916, on pp.
                        130–33.
               
                  23
                        The Prod to Progress, reproduced on p. 130, refers to the Sunday school under
                        "Calendar of Church Events." An earlier article in the Herald about Robinson's leadership in Anderson indicates that "Last May
                        a mission Sunday school was organized on East Eighteenth street. The beginning of a temporary
                        structure to house the school was made this week, a part of the spirit of progress that exists
                        in the church." Anderson Herald, October 28, 1915.
               
                  24 By far the most frequent religious activity reported in the Herald was the denominational revival. The Universalists, like other
                        denominations, received their best newspaper publicity for such events if total column inches is
                        a fair indication. Throughout October and November, 1915, issues there are almost daily reports
                        and summaries of the meetings conducted by evangelist Wesley G. Price of Pennsylvania who was in
                        Anderson for three weeks (October 18-November 8) and
            
            
            Plans for a church building were discussed early, even to the point of consulting an architect at
                    Elkhart. Meanwhile I solicited funds to complete the payment on the Sixth Street property. This was
                    soon sold. Before building plans matured, however, officers of the state board assumed direction. In
                    June 1916 a large, plain, ugly barnlike building was purchased from the Church of God. Its location,
                    near our residence, was excellent. The building should have been torn down, making room for a
                    smaller, more attractive structure. Instead one corner was remodeled for our use. This we occupied
                    the following September. During an interim period our services were held on the lower floor of the
                    Public Library.25
            
            The building project might have developed more happily, if friction had not arisen between some
                    members of the state board and me. Believing that the church had an obligation to inject moral
                    ideals into the political situation, I invited representatives of five political parties to lecture
                    (republican, democratic, socialist, progressive, prohibition). The president of the board, who was
                    also a non-resident member of 
                  then went to Pendleton for two weeks. The notices are enthusiastic about Price and
                            indicate that he was quite successful. Apparently this was true since he extended the
                            Anderson revival one week. Apparently also Price was impressed with Robinson: "Mr.
                            Robinson recently received an offer to assist the Rev. W. G. Price ... in a
                            months’ campaign in New York city. He was invited to take care of the newspaper
                            and other advertising, and the group work." Robinson did not accept because of
                            local duties. Ibid., December 21, 1915. Robinson presented a series of
                            Sunday night sermons on "Universalism Versus Orthodoxy" from March 5
                            through April 23, 1916. Ibid., March 4, 1916. In October, 1916, as part of
                            a three week revival, evangelist Ellenwood received enthusiastic and lengthy reports of his
                            meetings beginning with his second talk reported ibid., October 19, 1916.
                            Mason finished the meetings when Ellenwood was called home on October 25 for a funeral. Ibid., October 26, 1916. A report of an annual meeting of the Anderson
                            church indicates that membership in 1915 increased from forty-seven to sixty-three persons.
                                Ibid., January 13, 1916. No figure was located for 1916. Everett Dean
                            Ellenwood, Elgin, Illinois, was ordained in 1905; George Cross Baner, Akron, Ohio, was
                            ordained in 1899; Wesley G. Price, Titusville, Pennsylvania, was ordained in 1906. Neil R.

                     25 One report indicates that building plans had been discussed
                            relatively early in Robinson's ministry at Anderson. Several members of the church
                            apparently considered plans for the Sixth Street lot, but action was deferred until after
                            consulting with the state board. Plans reportedly were "for a brick building to
                            seat between two and three hundred persons." Ibid., March 4,
                            1915. No further mention of such plans has been located, but, when the Universalist option
                            on the property at Fourteenth and Brown streets was announced, the article mentions that the
                            state board recently set aside $2,000 for a "church home" in
                            Anderson. Ibid., October 28, 1915. The deal on this property was closed on
                            November 9, 1915, and the Universalists were to take over on June 1, 1916, when the Church
                            of God lease for the building was to expire. Ibid., November 10, 1915. At
                            their 1916 annual meeting it was announced that the land debt for the Sixth Street property
                            had been paid off. Ibid., January 13, 1916. The Sixth Street property was
                            reportedly sold on April 6, 1916; meetings until June 1 took place in the library. Ibid., April 7, 1916. Apparently several services were held in the new
                            building during June, but activities were suspended during the summer while Robinson was in
                            Chicago. Services were resumed on September 10 in the "partly remodeled
                            building." See for example ibid., June 3, September 9, 1916. The
                            building was dedicated on October 8, 1916, as part of the annual session of the Universalist
                            Convention of Indiana held in Anderson. The report of the dedication service indicates that
                            pledges for $2,000 to lift the full indebtedness had been received. Ibid., September 28, October 8, 10, 1916.
               
                     the Anderson church, objecting to my plan, wrote to some of the
                    speakers, urging them not to accept. Under these circumstances the lectures were unsuccessful;
                    perhaps they would have been any way.26 I still think my critic was out of
                    order, but I now see that I failed to convince in advance the members of the church of the supposed
                    wisdom of my policy. There was a second area of friction, presently to be described. My greatest
                    error in Anderson was in permitting alienation between the board and myself.
            My chief task should have been to provide an inviting, dignified, and useful building. To achieve
                    this additional members were needed. No one had thought the problem through. No one formulated the
                    task for me, or gave me counsel. I knew nothing about building construction or fund raising.
            Anderson had its social classes. One option open to me was to appeal to members of the working class,
                    including socialists. Price might have helped with this. Another option was to cultivate middle
                    class people like those of the Indianapolis or Muncie churches. Ellenwood might have sparked this.
                    In his series of meetings he was beginning to do so, when an emergency called him home. Class lines
                    meant nothing to me. Our little band, fine devoted people, were not the type to attract the more
                    affluent. One woman told me frankly that to join us would hopelessly shock her friends.
            The parents of Senator Frederick Van Nuys were neighbors. The father was a Unitarian; the mother, a
                    Universalist. With the father I used to play chess. When they died within forty-eight hours of each
                    other, the son could not quite trust me with the funeral. I assisted the Presbyterian minister.27 This was, I suppose, another demonstration of class lines.
            Neither memory or records can supply many names of active supporters of our movement. I do recall,
                    however, Cordelia Britton 
                  
                     26 A series of speakers representing four political parties was
                            announced in September, 1916. The first speaker was William Farmer, Socialist gubernatorial
                            candidate and a member of Robinson's church. The second speech by Thomas A. Daily,
                            Progressive gubernatorial candidate, was fully reported. The third speaker Elwood Haynes,
                            Prohibition party nominee for the United States Senate, was given good publicity; his
                            meeting reportedly "was one of the best of the series." Ibid., September 9, 16, 21, 28, 1916. No other reports of speakers were located. See
                            also The Prod to Progress announcement on p. 131.
                  
                     27 Mrs. Catherine Custer Van Nuys died on October 13, 1915; Dr. David
                            Henry Van Nuys died on October 15, 1915. Both had bronchial pneumonia; the report makes much
                            ado about the fact that they died exactly forty-eight hours apart. Their funeral was held on
                            Sunday, October 17, 1915, with Robinson and Birchard F. Brundage officiating. Anderson Herald, October 14, 16, 17, 1915. Frederick Van Nuys

                            to the United States Senate in 1932 and 1938. In 1916 he was a member of the Indiana State

                    servic [e]able by standards of that time and place.29 The auditorium, equipped
                    with noisy opera chairs, encouraged informality. Couden in Indianapolis, annoyed by the noise and
                    informality of his group, once preached on the texts, "Now when the tumult had
                    ceased" and "Let all things be done decently and in order."
            Here as at Anderson I conducted services, guided the Sunday School, arranged lectures and social
                    events, and made calls. I sought to make my sermons educational, interesting, and stimulating to
                    thought and moral insight. In some I interpreted the Bible according to modern scholarship. Many
                    themes were drawn from religious and secular history, and from contemporary social problems. In this
                    field I had been influenced by Baptist Walter Rauschenbusch.30
            
            Here also there were annual series of evangelistic meetings. One unusually successful entertainment
                    was a mock trial in the form of a breach-of-promise case. Participants entered into it with so few
                    inhibitions that the audience, of sufficient size to fill the room, almost accepted it as the real
                    thing.
            The regular congregation included several Hicksite Quakers,31

                            indicates that in 1859 "a frame house with a seating capacity of about 400 was
                            erected, at the cost of $2,500, on the corner of Main and Water streets. In 1895

                            has four manuscript volumes of Pendleton church records dating from its founding in 1859 to
                            1929. The records include the original constitution, minutes, parish records, and
                            treasurers’ records. Subsequent references to these records will be indicated

                     30 Walter Rauschenbusch (1861–1918) was ordained a Baptist
                            minister in 1886. He was professor of church history at Rochester Theological Seminary
                            beginning in 1902. His many works include Christianity and the Social
                            Crisis (New York, 1907) and A Theology for the Social Gospel (New
                            York, 1917). Who Was Who in America, I, 1011.
                  
                     31 "In April, 1827, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the
                            Religious Society of Friends split into two new and bitterly antagonistic organizations. The
                            [Hicksite-Orthodox] Separation spread and soon involved most Friends in America."
                            The controversy mainly concerned the teachings of Elias Hicks (1748–1830), a
                            Quaker
               
                     retired couples, elderly single women, and teachers. A few I
                    recall, by name: George W. [B.] Routt, superintendent of schools; Claude Fosher and his wife
                    [Cora?] (Claude's father was a retired Universalist minister); Frances
                    Brownback, widow of Dr. Orlando Brownback, and their daughter; Moses and Mary Rent; Charles and Kate
                    Frampton; Mollie Dunwoodie [Dunwoody] and her sister; Isaac Jones, our farmer member.32 One Sunday Isaac took me home to dinner, unannounced. Soon we were seated at a table
                    loaded with chicken, sweet potatoes, breads, jams, jellies, pies, cakes, and canned peaches. At the
                    end Mrs. Jones apologized, "If I had known I was to have company, I would have had white
                    potatoes too."
            
                    Other denominations and their ministers
                
            I joined the Anderson ministerial association, attending regularly in spite of some unfriendliness.
                    We met at a host church for a program, followed by a luncheon with the usual Indiana abundance of
                    food. Once at a Negro church supply was so generous that dishes had to be piled on top of each
                    other. At one session I gave a paper on "Christian Socialism" and once took part
                    in a debate on this theme.33
            
            In some instances it was difficult to respect my colleagues. Average educational level was low. It
                    was perhaps for this reason that Presbyterian Birchard F. Brundage seldom came. One highly popular
                    pastor cribbed his address at a state institution. Once the leader of our
                    "devotional" service used his time to attack me and my denomination. One man whom
                    I respected was O. B. Sarber of the Baptist church. Many of these men probably thought my preaching
                    was sending many souls to hell. My publicity methods must have irritated them.34

                        president of parish organization for 1896–1899. Ibid., III, 14.
                        Robinson also indicates that Jesse B. Fosher preached in Pendleton, Anderson, and Richmond and
                        moved to Illinois in 1899. Robinson, "Universalism in Indiana," 181. Orlando
                        W. Brownback, M. D., began his practice in Pendleton in 1867. He was apparently still alive
                        around 1923 according to Netterville's discussion. His wife Kate King Baird Brownback
                        (1869–1918) was active in the Universalist church and is mentioned often in the
                        Pendleton records. They had two daughters, Frances Brownback Hays and Katherine who was
                        connected with the Insurance Department of the Pendleton Trust Company. Frances Brownback is
                        mentioned in the Pendleton records. Biographical information is in Netterville, Centennial History, II, 63–66.
               
                  33 The presentation of this paper was reported in the Anderson Herald, May 11, 1915.
               
                  34 Birchard F. Brundage was minister of Anderson's First
                        Presbyterian Church from 1912 until 1917 when he took leave to become a chaplain in the United
                        States
            
            
            I had three ministerial friends. With Nathaniel Bigelow of the Episcopal church, an older man, I used
                    to play chess and billiards. With our wives we visited in each other's homes. I gave talks
                    to his men's club. An even closer friend was a man of my own age, Richard Gerberding of the
                    Lutheran church. He and I, disagreeing about most matters of theology, were drawn together by our
                    even greater disagreement with our other colleagues. With our wives we made a congenial foursome for
                    evenings of conversation and music. Eventually he attained a position of prominence in his
                        denomination.35
            
            My third friend was George Moffett, a graduate of Yale Divinity School, and pastor of the Christian
                    Church of Pendleton. Both in our homes and otherwise we saw much of each other. We often arranged
                    for our congregations to hold union services, sometimes on Thanksgiving Day. On one occasion we were
                    joint hosts to the surviving members of the Grand Army of the Republic. George and I conceived our
                    own ecumenical project: a union Sunday School for the entire community. This plan was killed by the
                    Methodist pastor refusing to cooperate. His first duty, he told us, was to the Methodist Board of
                        Publication.36
            
            An unhappy experience came from allowing myself, through Moffett's urging, to sponsor a
                    tabernacle revival, conducted by a travelling professional evangelist. He so disregarded promises
                    made by his advance agent as to disgust me, and otherwise to so behave himself as to alienate
                    Moffett.
            In Anderson I attended many functions in other churches, although only rarely asked to appear on the
                    program. These functions included regular and special services of worship, vespers, missionary
                    conferences, revivals, ministerial farewells, concerts, receptions, men's clubs, suppers,
                    banquets, and lawn socials. Thus I was educated by Lutherans, Presbyterians, Baptists,
                    Episcopalians, Methodists, United Brethren, Christians, and the Church of God. It all sounds
                    impossibly youthful now, but at the time, in spite of exposure to concentrated doses of orthodoxy, I
                    enjoyed it.

                        at McCormick Theological Seminary and universities at Edinburgh, Scotland, and Jena, Germany.

                  35 Richard H. Gerberding is mentioned in connection with St.
                        John's English Lutheran Church, Anderson, in June, 1915. His resignation to go to
                        Cleveland, Ohio, "not later than August 1" was reported the same day as
                        Robinson's resignation. Anderson Herald, June 9, 29, 1915; May 15,
                        1917. According to his son, who is preparing information about him, Gerberding died on January
                        12, 1972. David R. Gerberding to Pamela J. Bennett, May 17, 1972.
               
                  36 George Lee Moffett was born in Veedersburg, Indiana, in January, 1885,
                        and graduated from Butler University in 1911. He received a B. D. from Yale Divinity School in
                        1913. Eighth General Catalogue of the Yale Divinity School: Centennial Issue,

                    Community activities
                
            In addition to these "religious" contacts I engaged in other activities. As a
                    substitute teacher I taught briefly in the high schools of both communities. I helped organize a
                    Sunday afternoon forum in Pendleton and joined a choral group there. In Anderson I served on a
                    committee for the concert series. Infrequently I attended the Masonic Lodge. To the temperance cause
                    I gave sporadic support through the WCTU [Women's Christian Temperance Union], the No
                    Liscence [sic] League, a temperance convention, an effort to keep the Third Ward
                    dry, and the Anti-Saloon League. The latter, as I then knew it, did not merit the wide-spread harsh
                    criticism it later received. My wife and I supported the Franchise League (for woman suffrage), and
                    she attended its convention in Indianapolis. In the same city I attended the convention of the
                    National Conference of Charities. My wife and I visited public institutions: the jail, the courts,
                    the poor farm, the orphans’ home, and the industrial school. My diary also mentions a
                    county Sunday School convention, the Grange, the Farmers’ Institute, Labor Forum, YMCA
                    [Young Men's Christian Association], YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association],
                    Old Ladies’ Home, County Medical Society, an Odd Fellows social, Rebeccah social,
                    trade-at-home banquet, bird club, art exhibit, and Riley Club. Sometimes I spoke for one of these
                    groups; more often I observed and listened.37
            
            The chief non-religious organization with which I was allied was the Anderson local of the old
                    Socialist Party. As a "dues-paying member" I regularly attended its usually
                    uninspired meetings, occasionally speaking for it. One would need to read the early novels of Upton
                    Sinclair to understand the devoted loyalty of its members, some of whom by their participation
                    risked the welfare of their families. Yet meetings were often as dull as business meetings of
                        churches.38 I recall long discussions about the proper disposal of an
                    outworn refrigerator. It was the personal and moral qualities of the 
                  
                     37 Robinson reportedly was instrumental in the founding of the
                            Anderson Anti-License League by the Ministerial Association. Anderson Herald, June 22, 1915. The Woman's Franchise League of Indiana was founded in
                            1911 to work for universal suffrage. "This organization soon became the leading
                            feminist body in the state, with sixty branches and a total of three thousand members by
                            May, 1916." Clifton J. Phillips, Indiana In Transition: The Emergence

                            There are frequent announcements about meetings of many of these organizations and
                            occasional references to Robinson's participation in various of them in the Herald during this period.

                            771. Meetings and activities of the Socialist party are frequently printed in the Herald during Robinson's residence in Anderson. When he left
                            Anderson in June, 1917, Robinson reportedly was the Socialist nominee for Anderson city
                            clerk. Anderson Herald, May 15, 1917.
               
                     members which fascinated me. Some of them were among the
                    accessions to our church.
            During my Indiana sojourn there were two unusual events. On Sunday March 11th, 1917, we watched a
                    tornado pass over the city. It hit nearby Newcastle, and hit it hard. Relief funds were collected
                    and Brundage delegated me to deliver the money. This I did a week later, seeing at close range the
                    trail of wreckage which such a storm can leave.39
            
            The other event, very different, was a MIT banquet in Indianapolis on January 14th, 1916.
                    Simultaneous banquets were in progress in Boston and other large cities. This was prior to
                    development of radio and television. At each place was an individual telephone, through which one
                    could hear speakers on both sides of the continent and the repartee among men from all over the
                    nation. So far as I know, it was unique.40
            
            
                    The wider Universalist field
                
            To the active Universalist churches of the state I used to go for pulpit exchanges or special
                    programs. There were dedications of remod[e]led buildings at Indianapolis and Oaklandon. Farther
                    afield I preached in New Madison, Plain City, and Woodstock (Ohio), Oak Park (Illinois), and Boone
                    (Iowa). I met with mid-west clergymen in Chicago and attended the Illinois convention in Joliet.41
            
            Naturally I attended the annual sessions of our Indiana convention in Indianapolis. My interest in
                    rural churches led me to believe that not enough was being done to revive and serve our dormant
                    societies. At the 1916 session I led a rebellion against the board of trustees, becoming the
                    secretary of the convention. In this capacity I visited our dormant or semi-active churches, in many
                    of which I gave an address. In the southeastern section during the first week I made contacts in
                    Fairview, Saluda, Milan, Rising Sun, Aurora, and Manchester. During the second week I was in the
                    northwest: Fincastle, 
                  
                     39 The initial and longest coverage in the Herald
                            appeared under a banner headline "Newcastle Suffering Great" on Tuesday,
                            March 13, 1917. Relief poured in from all over the state. The Herald
                            contains stories about the disaster for many days after the event. The Herald was not published on Mondays.
                  
                     40 A story about this Golden Jubilee Banquet indicates that, besides
                            being "the most elaborate trans-continental telephone stunt ever staged,"
                            there were three million dollars in gifts pledged to the Massachusetts Institute of
                            Technology that night. Thirty-five cities participated in the event which included remarks
                            by Alexander Graham Bell and Orville Wright. Credit for the telephone hookup was given to J.
                            J. Carty, chief engineer of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company.
                            Carty's explanation is not printed, but each alumnus "had individual
                            watch-case receivers." "A Memorable Banquet," Technology Review, XVIII (July, 1916), 540, 542, 540–55.
                  
                     41 Robinson was attending a conference of Midwest Universalist
                            ministers in Chicago in January, 1916. Anderson Herald, January 29, 1916.
                            According to the Herald for Friday, October 2, 1914, he was attending the
                            Universalist convention of Illinois "this week."
               
                     Brookston, and Morocco. To the west [mainly eastern Indiana] I
                    went in the third week, visiting Mt. Carmel, Ireland, Boston, Dublin, and Richmond. In the final
                    fourth week I went to points in the eastern counties [mainly central and northeast]: Logansport,
                    Salem, Roann, Huntertown, Cromwell, Castleton, and Oaklandon. On these expeditions I also visited
                    other communities which I cannot now identify.42
            
            The hoped-for a[g]gressive campaign to revive rural churches got nowhere. Insensitive to the
                    magnitude of changes going on in country life, we rebels had no adequate plan. Even with greater
                    wisdom, achievement would probably have been impossible. Working against the long-time members of
                    the board interfered with team work needed to develop the work in Anderson.
            One benefit from my travels was an opportunity to talk with the elderly Rev. T. E. Ballard at the
                    home of his son in Crawfordsville. Many years earlier he had been a vigorous evangelist for the
                    Universalist cause in Indiana, often debating with orthodox opponents. Disapproving of doctrinal
                    changes among Universalists, he had transferred to the Methodists.43
                    Conversations with him aided in my writing of "Universalism in Indiana."
            In the summer of 1915, together with my wife, my parents, and other relatives, I attended
                    Universalist conventions in California.44 Our party left Chicago in two special
                    trains on July 2nd. The afternoon of the Fourth was spent in a tour of Salt Lake City, where
                    Bostonians were surprised to find a hotel "just as good as anything in Boston." In
                    Pasadena we were housed in a beautiful cottage hotel and served an abundance of fruits and
                    vegetables. The Los Angeles area, smog free, charmed us all. After the convention sessions we
                    visited the expositions in San Diego and San Francisco. Here on July 18th Universalist Day was
                    observed as Rev. Marion D. Shutter45
                    
                  
                     42 The Universalist Convention of Indiana met on February 25, 1916.
                            Mrs. Robinson and Cordelia Britton were elected trustee and president of the
                            Women's Missionary Association. In addition, Robinson "was instructed to
                            prepare a history of Universalism in Indiana in connection with the Indiana Centennial
                            year.’ Ibid., February 26, 1916. This history, as already
                            noted, was published in the Indiana Magazine of History. In the spring of
                            1916 Robinson announced a several weeks tour of daily visits to all Indiana Universalist
                            churches for progress reports as instructed by the state committee. Ibid.,
                            May 16, 1916. Robinson reported on these trips under the heading "Indiana News
                            Letter" in the Universalist Leader, XIX (April 22, June 10, July
                            1, 1916), 397, 565, 645–46. In the text here Robinson has confused some of his
                            directions as indicated by the bracketed insertions.

                     45 Marion Daniel Shutter (1853–1939) was ordained a Baptist
                            minister in 1881. He changed his views and became pastor of the First Universalist Church,
                            Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1886. He was president of the Universalist General Convention
                            from 1911–1915. Shutter seems best known for his book Applied
                                Evolution (Boston, 1900), "which was widely advertised and read, [and] had
                            been given
               
                     talked to an audience shivering in the fog. The return journey
                    was made through the northwest and Glacier Park. In late August we returned to our home in Anderson.
                    During the summer the Anderson Herald had published my story of these events in
                    four installments.46 Subsequent to the years of which I have been writing many
                    changes have occurred. Two denominations have consolidated to form the Unitarian Universalist
                    Association. Population shifts have accelerated. Climates of interest and opinion have shifted.
                    Today (1970) there are seventeen Unitarian Universalist societies in Indiana, of which twelve are
                    new since 1939. Of the other older organizations three were Universalist: Manchester (1844), Muncie
                    (1859) and Oaklandon (1870). Two were Unitarian: Hobart (1872) and Indianapolis (1900).47

            The residence of my parents in Oak Park made possible frequent visits back and forth. We spent our
                    first two Christmases there, enjoying theater and opera. Our first-born, Arnold Herrick Robinson,
                    arrived in Anderson on December 11th, 1916.48 We managed to visit my
                    wife's parents in northern New York.
            During our second summer I was a student at the University of Chicago, enjoying courses in
                    "Early Christianity and Contemporary Religions" with Shirley Jackson Case,
                    "History of the Idea of God" with Shailer Mathews, and "New England
                    Church History" with Professor Christie.49 During all of these years I
                    was busy with research 
                  first as a series of lectures to his church in Minneapolis. ... it reflected a boundless
                            optimism concerning man's limitless possibilities on earth." Cassara, Universalism in America, 38. Cassara prints excerpts from Applied Evolution, ibid., 230–40.

                            since 1939: Michigan City (1954), Bloomington (1949), Bartholomew County (Columbus, 1967),
                            Elkhart (1961), Evansville (1951), Fort Wayne (1939), Indianapolis (1971), Richmond (1964),
                            Rushville (1952), South Bend (1949), Terre Haute (1955), Lafayette (1947). It indicates that
                            Hobart was organized in 1874 and All Souls in Indianapolis in 1903.

                     49 Shirley Jackson Case (1872–1947), a Baptist, was
                            professor of New Testament Interpretation (1915–1917) at the University of
                            Chicago. She was later chairman of the church history department and dean of the Divinity
                            School. Among her extensive publications are The Evolution of Early
                                Christianity (Chicago, 1914), The Social Origins of Christianity
                            (Chicago, 1923), and The Social Triumph of the Ancient Church (New York,
                            1933). Who Was Who in America, II, 106–107. Shailer Mathews
                            (1863–1941) was a Baptist and was professor of history and comparative theology
                            at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago from 1906–1933. Among his
                            published works are The Church and the Changing Order
                  
               
                     for, and the writing of, my "Universalism in
                    Indiana."
            My earned income for the two years and nine months came from four sources. From the Anderson church I
                    received $1253; from Pendleton, $1038; from our state convention
                    $808; and from fees, $160. The total of $3259 was nearly matched by
                    expenses: about $3000.
            Three factors contributed to my decision of [sic] leave Indiana: the typical
                    restlessness of young ministers faced with a situation from which they see no way out, the growing
                    conviction that I was accomplishing little either for the cause or for myself, and the desire for
                    further graduate study. Arrangements were made for me to register in the department of American
                    history at Ohio State University and to become minister of Universalist churches at Plain City and
                    Woodstock. Here I began my work on June 16th, 1917.50
            
            I look back over my Indiana years with much satisfaction. They were the years of early married life,
                    of the birth and infancy of my first child, of close relationships still with those of my parental
                    household. I can now be somewhat amused at my feverish activities, with the accompanying delusion,
                    at least at first, of achievement. Probably I did succeed to the point of making Andersonians aware
                    that there was such an institution as the Universalist church. The California trip turned our faces
                    westward. The decision to undertake graduate work led to a renewed interest in productive study and
                    intellectual development. The publication of my essay in The Indiana Magazine of
                        History encouraged me to further research and writing.

                        first of June." Ibid., May 19, 1917. The Pendleton church was given
                        notice at the monthly meeting of March 7, 1917, that Robinson's "resignation
                        could be expected at anytime." At the May 14 meeting employing a new minister was the
                        question at hand. "Pendleton Universalist Church Records," II, 61, 63. The
                        parish record indicates that he resigned June 1, 1917. Ibid., III, 7.

               Pierre Gibault, Missionary, 1737–1802. By Joseph P. Donnelly, S.J.

            With the observance of the bicentenary of the American Revolution there undoubtedly will be a revival
                    of interest in George Rogers Clark's conquest of the Old Northwest, and in connection with
                    this will come consideration of the role played by Father Gibault in that operation. Father Joseph
                    P. Donnelly, drawing on Catholic archives in Canada and the United States and other sources, has
                    written the first extended biography of the priest about whom historians have differed so widely.
                    Jacob Piatt Dunn, for instance, declared him to have been the outstanding patriot of the Old
                    Northwest, and Clarence W. Alvord found him a far from attractive figure.
            Father Gibault was ordained to the priesthood in Quebec at the rather late age of thirty on March 19,
                    1768, and left the following June for the Illinois Country. His superior, Jean-Olivier Briand,
                    Bishop of Quebec, apparently sent him forth with some misgivings; and this lack of confidence,
                    justified or not, would continue through his years of service at Kaskaskia, Vincennes, Ste.
                    Genevieve, Cahokia, and finally New Madrid, where he died in 1802. Petty politics, the remoteness of
                    the area, and the confusion that prevailed in civil and clerical authority in this turbulent period
                    would have made the lot of a missionary, no matter how strong he might have been, very difficult.
                    The challenge presented by the arrival of Clark and his army at Kaskaskia in July, 1778, was
                    probably too complex for Gibault to meet decisively. He must have been aware of his
                    bishop's opposition to the American cause, and his role in persuading the citizens of
                    Vincennes to take an oath of allegiance to Virginia was in direct violation of this. The priest
                    indicated his awareness that he had acted contrary to his superior's expressed position
                    when later he denied having aided the Americans, even writing to his bishop on May 22, 1788:
                    "not only did I not meddle in anything, but on the contrary I have always regretted and
                    still do regret every day the loss of the mildness of British rule" (p. 82). Donnelly tries
                    to explain, but not very convincingly, Gibault's apparent collaboration with Clark and the
                    subsequent denial of it as due to his "volatile character which inclined him to extremes of
                    enthusiasm and discouragement. ... Given his temperament, it is not impossible that Gibault
                    rationalized his ... position. ... he may well have become convinced that he really did not aid
                    Colonel Clark or that he had any official hand in causing the British to lose Vincennes"
                    (p. 84).
            
            After 1780 Father Gibault's difficulties continued. He was out of favor with his Canadian
                    superior, and, when the Illinois Country came under the authority of the newly created diocese of
                    the Bishop of Baltimore, he found himself rebuffed by that prelate. He then settled in New Madrid
                    under the ecclesiastical superior of Spanish Louisiana where his last years were "one long
                    series of petty annoyances" (p. 5).
            Gibault's participation in Clark's conquest, puzzling though it is, is certainly
                    the most interesting aspect of his missionary career. As Donnelly concludes, despite his own denial
                    Pierre Gibault was a factor in Clark's success. The significance of the conquest in the
                    treaty negotiations at Paris in 1783 is disputed by historians to this day, but this reviewer is
                    inclined to agree with Donnelly that Gibault, still "an historical enigma" is
                    "an important, if minor, character in the history of the War of Independence" (p.
                    5).
            It might be pointed out that Barthelemi Tardiveau was not an Illinois congressman (p. 119). The book
                    would have benefited from the inclusion of a map of the Illinois Country and a more complete index.

               Debs. Edited by Ronald Radosh. Great Lives Observed. Edited by
                    Gerald Emanuel Steam. (Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1971. Pp. viii, 181. Notes,
                    bibliographical note, index. Clothbound, $5.95; paperbound, $2.45.)
            
               Debs is one of the volumes in Prentice-Hall's Great Lives
                        Observed series and, like the other volumes in the series, attempts to present "a
                    three-fold perspective" of Debs drawn from his speeches and writings, his
                    contemporaries’ attitudes toward him, and analyses of him by "leading
                    historians."
            The largest part of the book is taken up by Debs’ speeches and writings. Professor Ronald
                    Radosh has done a careful job in selecting material which throws light on the evolution of Debs from
                    "Conservative unionist" to Socialist "revolutionary" and on the
                    two pillars of Debs’ ideology: his conviction that industrial unionism would lead to the
                    economic salvation of society, just as socialism would lead to its political salvation. Along the
                    way the speeches and writings included in this collection also reveal Debs’ curious
                    blending of nineteenth century rhetoric ("Old Josh" Leach's grey hair was
                    "the frost that never melts") with very advanced attitudes and opinions respecting
                    such twentieth century issues as war and peace, militarism, poverty,  and racism. Even more important was Debs’ achievement in
                    blending European socialist theory and tradition into what appeared to many of his contemporaries to
                    be an "Americanized" program of peaceful, evolutionary change.
            The selection of material from Debs’ contemporaries ranges from the warm regard for him
                    held by a Terre Haute (non-Socialist) attorney, who counted "his friendship among the
                    blessings of a lifetime" (p. 89), to the frenzied estimate of Theodore Roosevelt who
                    described Debs as a "mere inciter to murder and preacher of applied anarchy" (p.
                    132).
            Scarcely more consensus regarding Debs has developed among leading historians. Most of them have been
                    attracted by Debs’ warm humanity but are badly divided on such questions as his effect on
                    unionism, his understanding (or misunderstanding) of Marxism and capitalism, and his niche in
                    history as "liberal democrat" or De Leonite revolutionary. In an
                    "Afterword" Radosh offers his interpretation of the conclusions regarding Debs
                    reached in the essays by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., H. Wayne Morgan, Ray Ginger, Bert Cochran, David
                    Herreshoff, and James Weinstein. In doing so Radosh contributes his own conclusion that
                    "Ray Ginger has written what will remain the classic biography of
                    Debs" (p. 175), a curious preempting of the field and, one would think, a prophecy that
                    Ginger would hesitate to endorse.

               Kentucky Bourbon: The Early Years of Whiskey making. By Henry G. Crowgey.
                    (Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, 1971. Pp. xiv, 171. Notes, illustrations,
                    bibliography, index. $9.75.)
            As the title indicates this brief volume examines the early years of whiskeymaking in Kentucky. In
                    addition to the development of distilling in the state, Professor Crowgey also discusses
                    technological advances in whiskey production, the personal and social drinking habits of frontier
                    settlers, the Kentucky reaction to the federal excise tax on whiskey, the utilization of distilled
                    spirits in both home remedy and patent medicine, whiskey traffic on the Ohio and
                        Mississippi rivers, liquor purchases by the military for its own use and
                    for distribution to the Indians, and the use of whiskey as commodity money. In attempting to derive
                    the facts from a host of myths and legends, many of which were initiated by local historians,
                    Crowgey combed newspapers, journals, court records, and personal  diaries of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The extent and depth of his research into
                    such sources is impressive.
            Distilled spirits and the knowledge of their production moved westward with each advance of the
                    frontier and in Kentucky distilling spirits from native fruits and grains began with the first
                    permanent settlements in the 1770s. Early distilling constituted a home industry and those who
                    practiced it employed whatever materials and ingredients were available. By the 1790s coppersmiths
                    in Kentucky were producing stills and the corresponding apparatus necessary for local production.
                    Although a temperance movement swept the state in the 1830s, a number of early distillers were also
                    prominent members of the clergy.
            As a commercial enterprise, stills were frequently operated by a pioneer entrepreneur as one of many
                    investments. Slowly the pot-still gave way to the steam process in whiskeymaking, but not until the
                    nineteenth century did distillers systematically employ a distinctive grain mixture or did the name
                    "bourbon" become well known. Several crude formulas were developed for determining
                    the proof of a particular lot of spirits prior to the widespread use of hydrometers, but for many
                    years consumers and distillers alike disregarded age and color as definite characteristics of
                    quality.
            Students of Kentucky history and those interested in the historical development of distilling will
                    find this book informative and enjoyable reading; scholars concerned with the broader implications
                    of such a study will be less satisfied. The forces behind the movement of distilling from the
                    cottage to the factory and the impact of a nationalizing market on a local industry, evident in
                    Kentucky by the middle of the nineteenth century, needs further amplification and analysis. In one
                    section of the work the historical objectivity of the author appears to falter. Crowgey's
                    apparent sympathy for the Kentucky distillers in their belated opposition to the excise tax on
                    whiskey in 1791 shows through in several places. For example, in explaining the early apathy of many
                    Kentucky distillers toward the new tax he sees them living in "an age of happy ignorance of
                    the galloping ways of federal coercion" (p. 86). "The triumphant march of
                    bureaucracy began without delay ..." (p. 85) in establishing the agencies necessary to
                    collect the tax. And those responsible for collection are "Bluegrass bureaucrat
                    [s]" (p. 95) or "swooping revenue agents" (p. 89).
            Such criticism, however, should not cloud a carefully researched monograph which in numerous
                    instances replaces fiction with historical fact.

               Ethnic Voters and the Election of Lincoln. Edited with an introduction by
                    Frederick C. Luebke. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1971. Pp. xxxii, 226. Notes, tables,
                    appendices. $9.75.)
            This volume contains eleven essays on ethnic voting in the presidential election of 1860. Arranged in
                    the chronological order of their original publication, the first nine are journal articles, the
                    earliest from 1932, and the final two were prepared for this anthology. Professor Luebke is a
                    qualified editor for this topic, as his own published research has demonstrated. The introduction
                    deserves attention as a succinct digest of work published to date, and the selections amplify this
                    history, documenting the evolution of scholarship concerning ethnic voting in 1860. Inevitably, the
                    major focus is upon the role of German voters in the states of the former Northwest Territory.
                    Luebke is justified in reflecting this emphasis since past and current research has given major
                    attention to it.
            The first five articles in part present the views of the "traditionalists," those
                    historians who believe that foreign born voters of the Northwest, particularly Germans, moved en
                    masse into the Republican party in 1860, providing the key votes which elected Lincoln. In addition,
                    this first section of the book reproduces some of the work of historians who led the attack on the
                    traditional view and includes Joseph Schafer's famous article of 1941, based upon Wisconsin
                    township data. Although not subtitled, this section might have been labeled "Pre-Empirical
                    Research."
            The final six articles were selected from recent empirical research on the 1860 election, including
                    George H. Daniels’ analysis of Iowa township data and Paul J. Kleppner's
                    "religious polarization" hypothesis based upon data from Pittsburgh's
                    wards. These articles successfully challenge the traditional view and add several new dimensions to
                    an understanding of the 1860 election. Daniels and others, following Schafer's lead, have
                    shown that certain large blocs of Germans remained loyal to the Democratic party in 1860. Ronald P.
                    Formisano's article, "Ethnicity and Party in Michigan,
                    1854–60," agrees that ethnicity is a key variable but asserts that it did not
                    operate independently of the religious affiliation of the ethnic groups in question. As Luebke
                    points out, Formisano, Kleppner, and others have found ethnicity to be "a cloak disguising
                    more important religious and cultural variables" (p. xxx). These articles present data that
                    are fully representative of the areas studied and utilize modern statistical analysis. They also
                    illustrate the editor's claim (p. xxxi) that historians have yet to examine all of the
                    variables that might hold the key to ethnic voting in the midnineteenth century  and that important geographic areas have yet to be studied before
                    achieving a full picture of ethnic voting in 1860.
            As editor, Luebke had comparatively few choices since the body of articles on 1860 ethnic voting is
                    not yet extensive. Nevertheless, the first five selections can be viewed mainly as historical
                    curiosities and not of major importance today. Luebke's summary of them is more than
                    adequate. Had he restricted himself to the introductory digests, it would have allowed him to
                    allocate more space to recent research efforts. Also, Luebke is qualified to author an article
                    analyzing the research methods that have been used to study the 1860 election; such an article would
                    have been appropriate to this volume and useful to scholars. Nonetheless, this anthology should help
                    to focus attention upon an election that needs further study by historians and upon the most recent
                    subtleties of election data analysis that deserve a rightful place as tools for the American
                    political historian.

               The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict, 1888–1896.
                    By Richard Jensen. (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1971. Pp. xvii, 357. Notes, tables,
                    appendix, critical guide to sources, index. $12.50.)
            
               The Winning of the Midwest is a study of the changing character of voting patterns
                    and party organizations in six midwestern states (Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and
                    Wisconsin) in the 1890s. The presidential election of 1888 confirmed the contemporary view that the
                    Midwest was safe Republican territory. The gubernatorial and congressional elections of 1889 and
                    1890, however, resulted in a near Democratic sweep. Then in 1894 the Republicans returned to power
                    with a massive landslide victory and set out to solidify their newly organized "coalition
                    into a standing majority that lasted until the New Deal." Professor Jensen is primarily
                    concerned with the issues and conflicts which produced this "dizzy series of electoral
                    turnabouts" (p. xiii).
            While acknowledging the importance of other issues, particularly economic ones, the author apparently
                    believes that religion was the source of most political conflicts in the Midwest. "Religion
                    shaped the issues and the rhetoric of politics, and played the critical role in determining the
                    party alignments of the voters" (p. 58). Using the methods of the quantifier, he attempts
                    to analyze the religious composition of the states involved in the study and to demonstrate a
                    correlation  between party affiliation and religious preference.
                    In addition, he discusses the religious polarization of the Midwest and the political conflicts
                    between primarily Republican pietistic denominations (Methodists and Congregationalists) and
                    primarily Democratic liturgical denominations (Roman Catholic and German Lutherans), The hostility
                    between these two groups manifested itself in such issues as the battle over prohibition in Iowa and
                    Ohio, parochial education in Wisconsin, and the threat of new immigrants to the coal industry in
                    Illinois.
            Although the study should be considered a significant contribution to the political history of the
                    Midwest, there is, in this reviewer's opinion, a major flaw. Because of the scarcity of
                    evidence, Jensen has been highly selective in his analysis and expects the reader to accept too many
                    unsupported assumptions and generalizations. He uses, for example, religious preference data from an
                    1895 Iowa state census to determine a ratio between actual members of a denomination and individuals
                    expressing a preference for that denomination. Then, he argues: "By assuming the ratios
                    were about the same for the same denomination in other midwestern states (a fairly strong
                    assumption, especially when dealing with cities) it becomes possible to estimate the results of a
                    hypothetical survey (in 1890) asking each person over the age of ten to state his religious
                    ‘preference’ " (p. 86). This, seemingly, is asking a great deal from
                    the reader particularly since Jensen apparently fails to question the validity of some evidence such
                    as the information supplied by churches (not individuals) to the 1890 federal census takers. Similar
                    questions could be raised concerning his assumptions that partisanship followed religious lines or
                    that most liturgicals became Democrats and most pietists became Republicans in the Midwest after
                    1850.
            Anyone studying midwestern politics during this period must acknowledge the significance of religious
                    issues. They undoubtedly influenced the behavior of voters, but whether religion was more important
                    in the Midwest than other factors such as economics or class antagonisms remains to be proved.
                    Perhaps Jensen would have been more successful if he had confined his analysis to a smaller area.

               The Republican Command, 1897–1913. By Horace Samuel Merrill and
                    Marion Galbraith Merrill. (Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, 1971. Pp. xi, 360. Notes,
                    illustrations, bibliography of works cited, index. $12.50.)
            The Merrills argue that between 1897 and 1913 the Republican 
                    party "had before it both the opportunity and need to modernize its policies" on
                    the tariff, currency, trusts, and Negro. Their book focuses on these issues, they explain,
                    "because they were fundamental matters upon which party leaders had built Republican
                    strength and with which voters continued to associate the party" (p. ix).
            They conclude that the party's top leadership—consisting of Presidents William
                    McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft; Senators Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island,
                    Orville H. Platt of Connecticut, William B. Allison of Iowa, and John C. Spooner of Wisconsin; and
                    House Speaker Joseph G. Cannon of Illinois—in their commitment to maintenance of
                    "the Republican-business partnership" failed to meet this challenge. Instead, the
                    GOP "almost ignored the Negro problem and administered but superficial attention and
                    patchwork legislation to the tariff, trust, and banking-currency questions" (p. 7).
            Even Roosevelt, whom the Merrills credit with showing "more inclination than his colleagues
                    ... to modernize the Republican party" (p. ix), made "no determined effort to
                    divorce" the GOP "from its accommodation to business interests" (p. 93).
                    After Roosevelt's departure from the White House, the new ruling triumvirate of Taft,
                    Aldrich, and Cannon "allowed the party increasingly to appear to be the servant of powerful
                    special interest groups" (p. 277). The result of this failure to deal constructively with
                    the problems of a complex industrial-urban society was the gradual disintegration of the Republican
                    party—due largely to the break up of the electorally crucial East-Middle West
                    alliance—climaxing in the Democratic triumph in 1912.
            Despite an impressive amount of research, the Merrills have written a disappointing book. The writing
                    is pedestrian, the narrative rambles, and their account largely follows well trod paths as regards
                    facts and interpretation. The student of the period will find in this volume little new information
                    except in its discussion of the currency question. The interpretation repeats the traditional
                    textbook staples about the GOP as the loyal servant of big business, the all powerful Senate Four,
                    Cannon's reactionary dictatorship in the House, and Taft's political ineptness.
                    Even the authors’ generally unfavorable portrayal of Roosevelt harks back to Henry F.
                    Pringle's debunking biography.
            Nor is their argument persuasive. As the Merrills themselves demonstrate, the party top command
                    followed, rather than led, in the framing of the Dingley tariff and the war with Spain. Even in the
                    1909 tariff fight Aldrich was as much the reluctant captive as the agent of powerful special
                    interests. They underestimate Roosevelt's substantive achievements in the face of
                    formidable political obstacles  and his even more important
                    contribution as an educator of and preacher to the American public. Their own evidence shows that
                    the major stumbling block to currency reform was the lack of consensus among the nation's
                    businessmen and bankers. And Taft, for all his political ineptness, did try to modernize the
                    party's approach to tariff making through his advocacy of a tariff commission.
            The fundamental difficulty with their book is that the Merrills look at the period from the
                    perspective of 1970's liberals. This shortcoming is most strikingly revealed in their
                    repeated indictment of the Republican leadership for its failure to take up "the crying
                    need for political championship of the Negroes" (p. 314). They ignore whether there was any
                    significant constituency to support such a crusade. The fact was that most Americans, North and
                    South, approved the status quo regarding the Negro. The historian has a duty to
                    make judgments; but he must do so in terms of what William James called the "live
                    options" available to men of the time, not by the values of a later day.

               Race Riot: Chicago in the Red Summer of 1919. By William M. Tuttle, Jr. Studies in American Negro Life. Edited by August Meier. (New York: Atheneum, 1970.
                    Pp. xi, 305. Notes, illustrations, maps, essay on sources, index. $8.95.)
            Events of the past decade have revived interest among historians in the causes and nature of violence
                    in American life. One of the most intelligent of these rediscoveries of the darker side of our
                    national experience is William Tuttle's study of the five day riot that gripped Chicago in
                    July of 1919. Race Riot adds substantially to an understanding of those events
                    first treated by the Chicago Commission on Race Relations, The Negro in Chicago
                    (1922), and most recently by Arthur Wasdow's From Race Riot to Sit-In, 1919
                        and the 1960s (1966).
            Tuttle does more than describe the riot which left twenty-three blacks and fifteen whites dead, over
                    five hundred people injured, and hundreds of homes and apartments burned. Rather, the University of
                    Kansas historian attempts to explain the complex of factors in the daily experience of white and
                    black Chicagoans that led to the riot. Basing his argument on the collective behavior theories of
                    sociologist Neil J. Smelser and his evidence on new material from interviews, manuscript
                    collections, and testimony in federal government records, Tuttle has made a serious effort
                    "to write of individuals and, as race  riots are
                    occurrences of the streets, to write history ‘from the bottom up’ "
                    (p. vii). Thus Tuttle broadens the conceptualization of race relations from official positions and
                    the statements of educated, articulate elites in the respective races to the deeply felt anger
                    between black and white people who occupied no positions and were basically
                    inarticulate—but who were the active participants in the riot.
            Most earlier explanations of the riot sought the cause in the social friction in housing and
                    amusements that resulted from the doubling of Chicago's black citizenry during the World
                    War I migration. While giving attention to such struggles over housing and for control of the
                    "turf," led by Irish "athletic clubs" like the Regan Colts,
                    Tuttle is more impressed with the importance of labor friction in the Red Summer of 1919, the
                    involvement of city ethnic politics, and the emergence of a militant "New Negro"
                    psychology of self-defense. In the week of the riot 250,000 Chicago workers were either on strike or
                    were threatening to strike; in the stockyard walkouts ninety per cent of the white laborers were
                    unionized, while only a quarter of the 12,000 black workers were. Repeated use of black
                    strikebreakers by the packers and other Chicago industrialists had made the concepts of
                    "Negro" and "scab" synonymous in the minds of many white
                    workers.
            Local politics had also exacerbated racial polarization during the late spring mayoralty campaign.
                    The Republican incumbant, William "Big Bill" Thompson, had staved off defeat from
                    a strong Democratic challenge based on white, ethnic Catholic voters by mobilizing solid bloc voting
                    in the city's black South Side. Finally, a shift in the psychology of the "New
                    Negro" in Chicago and other northern cities in 1919 turned earlier day lynchings into race
                    riots when blacks fought back. As the author concludes, the surprising thing about the Chicago riot
                    was not its outbreak, but rather that it had not occurred earlier and was not soon repeated
                    considering the distressingly similar pattern in the city's subsequent ethnic relations.

               How Shall They Hear without a Preacher? The Life of Ernest Fremont
                    Tittle. By Robert Moats Miller. (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1971. Pp.
                    xii, 524. Illustrations, notes, note on sources, index. $12.50.)
            It is an unusual package—a thick book about a parish minister by a university history
                    professor and published by a university press.
            Of course First Methodist Church of Evanston, Illinois, was not 
                    the usual parish. It was the first church founded in Evanston. Closely linked with Northwestern
                    University and with Garrett Biblical Institute, its 1918 membership of just over one thousand
                    already included a substantial representation of the power elite of the Chicago area, the nation,
                    and the Methodist Church.
            In 1918 Ernest Fremont Tittle came to be pastor of Evanston's First Methodist Church. Tittle
                    was hardly the usual minister. He was a high achiever with superb natural gifts and a passion for
                    duty. Under his leadership the membership grew to well over three thousand. Attendance at Sunday
                    worship came to average 1,500; some 5,500 gathered at First Church for weekday programs. Tittle was
                    first and always a working minister. His major life investment was in preaching, in pastoral labors,
                    and in leading worship. Because of his faithful ministry his members repeatedly rallied to support
                    his right to a free pulpit. They wanted and needed him there even if he said what they were not glad
                    to hear and led where they were not anxious to follow.
            Tittle was a consistent liberal in theology; faced with Fundamentalism and with Neo-orthodoxy he
                    matured, but he did not shift. He was a consistent pacifist in the very teeth of patriotic fervor
                    and World War II. He was a prophet for racial and economic justice. He was a political activist,
                    consistently voting for Norman Thomas for President. He was always hammering social pronouncements
                    through ecclesiastical bodies, and in two major crises it seemed he must be driven from his post or
                    die under the pressure of his opponents.
            Such is the man Professor Miller takes as subject. Miller was determined not to produce "one
                    of those moist memorials or effusive reminiscences or quaint anecdotal accounts that frequently
                    masquerade as religious biography" (p. ix). He did not know Tittle and was under no
                    emotional obligation; he was not under commission from the Tittle family. He aimed to produce a
                    legitimate chapter in twentieth century social history.
            It is a fascinating encounter. Tittle leads a very precarious life in the volume. Miller is always
                    kicking Tittle off the stage to give his own homilies on theology, dancing, marriage, liturgy, sex,
                    riding trains, singing, political endorsement, bombing, sin, preaching, and the like. When Miller
                    gets high in his zeal for full historical context, Tittle is often completely lost from view for
                    pages on end. Miller evidently forgets what he has said about Tittle and says it all over
                    again—the same impressions, the same facts, sometimes the very same words or even the
                    exact quotation.
            In spite of everything it comes out good. The author is a professional historian who is also a
                    professional writer; responsible evalnation  of evidence and
                    command of language are his marks. The subject, Tittle, will not be put down in life or in death;
                    his story throbs with vitality and significance. In the interaction of the two most readers will
                    find ground for thanks.

               A History of Missouri. Volume I, 1673 to 1820. By William E.
                    Foley. Missouri Sesquicentennial History. Edited by William E. Parrish. (Columbia:
                    University of Missouri Press, 1971. Pp. ix, 237. Illustration, notes, essay on sources, index.
                    $9.50.)
            The Missouri Sesquicentennial History is a projected set of five volumes, each by a
                    different author, designed as "a general survey of the broad political, social,
                    intellectual, and economic trends, rather than a highly detailed study of each period" (pp.
                    ix-x). In volume one William E. Foley deals with the nearly 150 years of Missouri's
                    progress from a wilderness to the threshold of statehood. The treatment does indeed explore the
                    broader aspects of the subject although it sometimes exhibits a certain shallowness due to an
                    evident determination to keep the text short. Unfortunately, the author mars parts of the narrative,
                    especially near the beginning, with a tendency to over romanticize and to fill in from his
                    imagination literary transitions that his material could not provide: "As dawn broke amidst
                    the dying echoes of the lively chants and the smoldering embers of the previous night's
                    fires, a stillness settled over the fort high atop the Missouri bluffs" (p. 132). Such
                    passages probably represent an attempt to avoid stilted academic prose, but they may tend to lessen
                    the writer's credibility with some readers.
            Accounts of the administrations of Governors James Wilkinson and Meriwether Lewis and of
                    Missouri's earlier uncomfortable adjuncting to Indiana Territory make up the heart of the
                    book. Though only five years are involved, 1804–1809, Foley allots nearly one third of
                    his text to a much fuller "general survey" of this period than he presents of
                    others. He acknowledges, for example, that personalities "played an important role in
                    shaping the political climate of territorial Missouri" (p. 204) but is usually able to
                    provide only the barest introduction to even the most important figures. In the chapters on these
                    five years, however, several characters, Wilkinson especially, emerge more completely as
                    personalities. Similarly, politics takes short shrift elsewhere, but here Foley devotes much of his
                    time to an enlightening treatment of the chaos produced by uncertain Spanish  land grants, the question which "more than any other dominated
                    politics throughout Missouri's territorial period" (p. 83). His style, too, adopts
                    a more temperate, straightforward approach which neither succumbs to stuffiness nor stoops to
                    hackneyed literary devices.
            The price of these excellent chapters is an attenuated discussion of the years following the War of
                    1812. Most surprising is the almost total neglect of the statehood movement which culminated in the
                    momentous Missouri Compromise debates. There is a brief summary of nonpolitical developments for
                    these later years, but references to political matters are so general they almost seem an
                    introduction to the next volume, where it is assumed the subject of approaching statehood will be
                    more particularly treated.
            Criticisms here notwithstanding, within the parameters of the project in which Foley was engaged he
                    has managed a great bulk of material well. The general reader, to whom the Sesquicentennial History is apparently directed, will probably consider this book a more
                    than satisfactory rendering of the history of early Missouri, while the specialist can benefit from
                    the concise overview of the subject and especially the model essay on sources.

               One Million Men: The Civil War Draft in the North. By Eugene C. Murdock.
                    (Madison: The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1971. Pp. xi, 366. Notes, illustrations,
                    tables, bibliographic note, index. $10.00.)
            In the Civil War, after the initial enthusiasm faded, the Federal government had to resort to
                    extraordinary methods to secure men for service. Volunteering alone simply could not fill the ranks
                    of a one million man army. Conscription became a necessity. In this well researched monograph Eugene
                    Murdock describes the organization and the process of the draft machinery as well as the chicanery
                    employed by those who turned the system to their profit. He also provides biographical vignettes of
                    many of those involved.
            The Civil War draft was an unpopular arrangement, riddled with loopholes. The Enrollment Act of 1863
                    was purposefully lenient and perhaps unintentionally ambiguous. This caused much confusion and
                    difficulty in the administration of the law. Provost marshals scattered throughout the nation had to
                    search out and identify men 20–45 years of age who were liable. When it called for men,
                    the War Department then allowed several weeks for each district to provide its quota. If enough
                    volunteered, there would be no conscription. If  it was
                    necessary to draft, a local lottery determined those to go. Finally, it remained up to the provost
                    marshals to serve notice on the drafted men.
            Of the 776,829 men whose names were drawn, only 46,347 actually served in the army. That is an
                    incredible statistic and well might cause one to question the effectiveness of the system. More than
                    twenty per cent simply did not report while 315,509 were exempted for one reason or another. Two
                    provisions greatly enhanced a man's chances of escaping service. During the first year of
                    the draft he could pay a commutation fee of $300 and not go; however, the next year, a
                    ruling permitted only conscientious objectors to take this course. There still remained,
                    nevertheless, the legal possibility of hiring substitutes whose prices went up drastically after the
                    change in the commutation provision.
            Unscrupulous men saw in the system opportunity to make money within and without the law. A large
                    class of so-called brokers rapidly emerged to take a large cut of the monies available in the
                    transactions between drafted men and their substitutes and in the government's payment of
                    bounties to volunteers. The bounty jumpers (a few jumped as many as thirty times) were definitely
                    lawbreakers. In many cases, however, the brokers controlled these men and collected the bulk of
                    their ill-gotten bounties.
            Those who attempted to administer the law not only had to cope with the brokers and their ilk but
                    also frequently had to face hostility in their communities. This could be dangerous, and ninetyeight
                    were, in fact, killed or wounded in the conduct of their duties. Copperheads in Indiana, Irish in
                    New York, and others throughout the North who did not want to serve for various reasons made a
                    formidable opposition. Many who were drafted resorted to almost any device to avoid service. Yet,
                    the system worked well enough, and there were enough honest patriots to maintain the strength of
                    Ulysses S. Grant's armies.
            Professor Murdock makes the crucial point that the purpose of the Civil War draft was not to draft
                    men but to use the threat of conscription to encourage volunteering. Thus the small number of
                    drafted men who actually served was not an indication of the effectiveness of the measure. The fact
                    that a million men were in the Union army in 1865 clearly demonstrates that, whatever the means,
                    enough men were in the blue uniform to win the war. He also points out, on the basis of analysis of
                    New York statistics, that the commutation and substitution provisions did not make the war
                    "a rich man's war, poor man's fight." He found little
                    correlation between the wealth of a district and the incidence of the reliance on these provisions.
            It would have helped the reader if the texts of the draft laws 
                    had been included in an appendix. Some more background on the evolution of the idea of military
                    service obligation would also have been helpful; the Civil War draft was not as much of a
                    "new departure" as Murdock emphasizes. The author chose to present the bulk of his
                    material in a series of examples within topical chapters. By eliminating several examples,
                    particularly in the chapters dealing with brokers and bounty jumpers, he could have avoided giving a
                    redundant effect to what is a good, solid monograph—a real contribution to Civil War
                    historiography.

               The Reluctant Farmer: The Rise of Agricultural Extension to 1914. By Roy V.
                    Scott. (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1970. Pp. xi, 362. Notes, bibliography, index.
                    $8.95.)
            Several years ago Professor Scott staked out the history of farm institutes as his particular area of
                    research. He has published several articles on their development and related activities in
                    particular states. Now the entire story has been brought together in what probably will be regarded
                    as the definitive work on the subject.
            Agricultural education has been a complex development over America's entire history as a
                    nation. The problem has been, at least in part, that leaders have developed various institutions to
                    conduct research and encourage farmers to adopt new methods. At the same time farmers have been
                    reluctant to adopt changes until they have been proven successful. Very simply, an ordinary farmer
                    cannot afford to risk an entire year's crop on a chance he might gain.
            In tracing the rise of agricultural education, Scott goes back to the gentlemen farmers and
                    agricultural societies of the nation's first years. He follows with a brief review of the
                    early agricultural press and the passage of the agrarian legislation of 1862. While important, these
                    activities did not reach the ordinary farmer, at least in their early years. Instead, according to
                    Scott, the farmers’ institute movement, often related to the agricultural colleges and
                    experiment stations, was the first educational activity to reach large numbers of farmers. The
                    movement, stemming from diverse sources, began to succeed after at least a few farmers in a given
                    state became interested. Actually, many of the first attempts failed, but, after successful efforts
                    in New England, the movement spread.
            Institute work in Ohio and Michigan stimulated developments in Indiana. However, after a beginning in
                    1882, no further effort was made in Indiana until 1889. In that year the legislature appropriated
                         $5,000 and assigned the leadership to Purdue
                    University. The trustees created a committee consisting of the president of the university, the
                    director of the experiment station, and the professor of agriculture, William C. Latta. They named
                    Latta the superintendent of institutes. Under his supervision the program grew until it was reaching
                    farmers in every county. Purdue University maintained overall supervision and furnished many of the
                    speakers and material for demonstrations at the various institutes.
            As a result of the success of the institutes and of similar work by a number of railroads, it became
                    apparent that the land grant colleges needed to develop new approaches. After attempts to reach
                    farmers by such devices as demonstration farms, the county agent system developed. While the author
                    gives Seaman A. Knapp credit for the system, he points out that it was not entirely original with
                    Knapp, and that it was surrounded by major controversy. Subsequently, the county agent system became
                    a joint project of the state colleges and the United States Department of Agriculture as spelled out
                    in the Smith-Lever Act of 1914.
            Scott bases his account upon source materials and lists most of the important secondary materials in
                    his bibliography. He has done well the difficult task of summarizing the experiences of most states
                    with institutes without getting trapped in monotonous detail. The book is well
                    indexed—something this reviewer counts on in University of Illinois Press volumes.
            The importance of the book lies in the fact that the diffusion of technology and the spread of
                    knowledge among farmers is a key to increased agricultural productivity. The problem, as Scott
                    points out, is not limited to the United States. Indeed, it is of even greater interest to those
                    charged with agricultural improvement in the less developed nations. This volume should be read by
                    economists and others concerned with problems of overseas development.

               The Legitimacy of the Business Corporation in the Law of the United States,
                        1780–1970. By James Willard Hurst. (Charlottesville: The University Press of
                    Virginia, 1970. Pp. xiii, 191. Notes, bibliography, index. $6.50.)
            James Willard Hurst, Vilas Professor of Law at the University of Wisconsin, is the leader of a group
                    of historians whose subject is the social history of law. Hurst believes that law grows out of
                    man's  social experience and that examination of a
                    people's history will uncover aspects of a legal system that logical analysis of the law
                    alone will not reveal. The study of the interaction of society and law in the United States is
                    Hurst's lifework, the fruit of which is a continuing list of books and articles, including
                        The Growth of American Law: The Law Makers (Boston, 1950) and "Legal
                    Elements in United States History," in Donald Fleming and Bernard Bailyn, editors, Law in American History (Cambridge, Mass., 1971).
            
               The Legitimacy of the Business Corporation in the Law of the United States
                    originated in a series of lectures that Hurst delivered at the University of Virginia in 1969.
                    "Legitimacy," as used here, "means that no ... power recognized in law
                    should be treated as an end in itself or as autonomous. An institution must be legitimated by its
                    utility to some chosen end other than its own perpetuation. ... [and] must be accountable for its
                    purposes and its performance by criteria not wholly in the control of the institution
                    itself" (p. 58). In short, the tenet of legitimacy holds that business corporations be both
                    useful and responsible to society. It is with that utility and responsibility in historical context
                    that Hurst deals.
            The first of the book's three major essays traces the history of public policy toward
                    business corporations from the early days of the Republic, when the creation of each corporation
                    required a special legislative act, to about 1890, by which time general incorporation laws in all
                    the states permitted business associations ready access to corporate status. The second essay
                    concerns itself with questions of corporate legitimacy between 1890 and the present. Until the 1930s
                    the law stressed utility rather than responsibility. That was a period in which the American people,
                    in the interest of economic growth and not without protest, to be sure, were willing to respond
                    favorably to businessmen's desire for freedom of action. The general disillusionment with
                    business during the 1930s shifted emphasis to responsibility as the criterion of corporate
                    legitimacy and inaugurated an era of public demand that the law compel that responsibility. The
                    book's third essay evaluates the role of the various law making agencies—state
                    and federal constitutions, judicial interpretation, executive and legislative action—in
                    the development of public policy toward corporations. Hurst argues that legislative action was
                    clearly most important, despite a significant corpus of "judge-made" law and the
                    development of new administrative processes (for instance, regulatory agencies) in the twentieth
                    century. In a final short chapter, Hurst concludes that, given its history, American society must
                    continue to look to the legislative branch of government for the satisfaction of the continuing,
                    insistent demand "to legitimize corporate power by its responsibility as well as its
                    utility" (p. 164).
            
            This synopsis by no means does justice to the profundity of Hurst's ideas, and their
                    nuances. The Legitimacy of the Business Corporation in American Law is a brilliant
                    little work. The book must be read with the closest attention, for the argument is so tightly
                    reasoned that to miss a sentence is to miss something important. The bibliography, alas, is
                    unannotated; the index is adequate; the format is pleasing, if unexceptional.

               Launching Social Security: A Capture-and-Record Account, 1935–1937.
                    By Charles McKinley and Robert W. Frase. (Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1970. Pp.
                    xxiv, 519. Notes, tables, chart, index. $12.95.)
            This two man odyssey into bureaucracy is an involved analysis of the Social Security administration
                    during its first seventeen months. McKinley, a political scientist, and Frase, an original member of
                    the Social Security staff, attended administrative meetings, reviewed notes and memoranda, and
                    interviewed early participants in the new agency. The results of their work are generally rewarding
                    but not intended for the uninitiated reader.
            The complexity of Social Security forced the authors to cover much ground lightly, and the
                    book's organization reflects the hopelessness of capturing, let alone recording, all of it.
                    Major emphasis goes to budget and staff framework; grants for the aged, dependent children, and
                    blind; unemployment compensation, and general management. Almost indispensable for distinguishing
                    the personnel is the appended list of names, without which even New Deal aficionados would get lost
                    in the charts and corridors.
            McKinley and Frase offer no surprises and usually concur with the account given by Arthur Altmeyer in
                    his Formative Years of Social Security (Madison, Wis., 1966). They offer greater
                    detail and objectivity, however, than the former chairman of the Social Security Board. There is
                    much here to please friends of Social Security despite the scarcity of heroes and idealism. These
                    administrators were not Rexford Tugwells rolling up their sleeves to remake society; they were, in
                    large part, anonymous bureaucrats who haggled over semantics, fought with congressmen and the Civil
                    Service Commission for field offices and personnel, manipulated state legislatures into conforming
                    with federal standards, campaigned against Alf Landon in the 1936 election, and succeeded in
                    establishing a network of unprecedented services.
            
            Opponents of the welfare state will likewise find failures described in ample detail. The Social
                    Security Board merits criticism for its inadequate leadership, and the authors reveal much
                    incompetency and "guerrilla warfare among certain of the top staff" (p. 476).
                    Jealous politicians also drained effectiveness from the program as they competed for new monies and
                    patronage that were as much an "aid to the elected" as to the intended recipients
                    (p. 165). Many of these revelations are predictable, but the authors put new shadings on old
                    portraits, such as the unflattering portrayals of Senator Carter Glass and Social Security
                    Coordinator Henry Seidemann.
            Its valuable observations accepted, an unevenness in premise and style weakens the book, particularly
                    its disquieting chronological inconsistency. McKinley and Frase completed their research in 1937,
                    wrote the manuscript in 1941, and gave very tentative conclusions at that date because
                    "only the future would tell" whether the Social Security experiment would succeed
                    (p. 492). Apparently they did not update these outdated conclusions before publication in 1970; yet
                    they did revise the introductory and less important sections of the book with material published as
                    late as 1963. Equally disquieting are excessively long quotations from administrative documents and
                    lengthy expository footnotes which frequently contain richer information than the text. Taken as a
                    whole, however, the authors have captured and recorded a portion of the New Deal worth preserving.

               Frontier Governor: Samuel J. Crawford of Kansas. By Mark A. Plummer. (Lawrence:
                    The University Press of Kansas, 1971. Pp. xiii, 210. Illustrations, maps, notes, bibliography,
                    index. $7.75.)
            This is a political biography of Samuel J. Crawford, a native of Indiana, who migrated to Kansas in
                    1859 where he was elected to the state legislature in the same year. When the Civil War erupted, he
                    resigned this position to command a black regiment in the Union Army. After the war he served two
                    terms (1864–1871) as governor of Kansas, encouraging immigration and reflecting public
                    opinion by supporting radical reconstruction. While advocating white control of Indian lands,
                    Crawford defended the interests of settlers and opposed the efforts of speculators to monopolize the
                    land for railroad construction. Nevertheless, he apparently received a section of land from the
                    Union Pacific Railroad, ostensibly for his aid in securing government approval of this
                    railroad's track in Kansas. During his  second term
                    Crawford unsuccessfully supported suffrage for blacks and women in Kansas. In 1872 he backed the
                    Liberal Republican party but followed the Greenback standard in 1876. He returned to the Republican
                    party for the final phase of his public career as a claims agent for Kansas in Washington from 1877
                    to 1891. During the rise of Populism he favored an expansive monetary policy but believed the
                    deprivations of the farmers were overstated by Populist leaders. The Spanish-American War,
                    imperialism, territorial expansion, the tariff, and the trusts turned him against the Republican
                    party and resulted in his support for Bryan and the Democrats in 1900.
            The author has "tried to use the story of Crawford's political career as a means to
                    throw some light on the ‘dark ages’ of Kansas history, that is, the period
                    between the much publicized ‘Bleeding Kansas’ territorial years and the
                    Populist era" (p. xii). Although the title indicates the main task is biography, the man
                    Crawford is lost in Kansas history. Kansas politics and Civil War military activity dominate the
                    opening chapters while Crawford's formative years are ignored. Perhaps due to missing
                    sources, Plummer says nothing about Crawford's youth, his relationship with his parents, or
                    early experiences that were important to his development. Thus, an important segment of his life is
                    passed by, and that feeling for a man that biography should provide is missing. The coverage of
                    Crawford's response to the rise of the Populist party and his gradual disillusionment with
                    the Republican party is too brief. Certainly the election of 1896 merits more than one sentence, and
                    his switch to the Democrats in 1900 warrants more than a few paragraphs. Although he did not die
                    until 1913, lack of sources has apparently hidden his position with regard to the reforms of the
                    early 1900s.
            The book is well written and organized although too much correspondence is reprinted. The reader gets
                    a good sense of the faction ridden and sometimes corrupt party politics of the period. The section
                    on railroads and speculators outlines a classic case of the pressures to expropriate Indian land.
                    Typical western attitudes come to the fore in the chapter "Crawford and the Indian
                    Problem." He favored Indian removal because "the Indians will neither improve nor
                    cultivate the lands, and their occupancy prevents others from doing it" (p. 85). Crawford
                    believed Indian management should be transferred from the Interior Department to the War Department
                    because he had little faith in the agents of the Department of the Interior or the peace policy
                    adopted in 1867. It seems clear that there are gaps in the record left by Crawford. If so, the
                    author should have stated so in his preface.

               Frontier Farming in an Urban Shadow: The Influence of Madison's Proximity on
                        the Agricultural Development of Blooming Grove, Wisconsin. By Michael P. Conzen. (Madison:
                    The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, for the Department of History, University of Wisconsin,
                    1971. Pp. xviii, 235. Figures, illustrations, notes, appendices, bibliography, index.
                    $10.00.)
            This study focuses on Blooming Grove Township in Dane County which is adjacent to Madison, Wisconsin.
                    Michael P. Conzen has attempted a microscale examination of a midwestern community in an effort to
                    show the impact of an emerging city on the farming community nearby. The text covers the years from
                    1838 to 1890. The book is designed primarily for economists and economic historians who are
                    interested in case studies of agricultural regions.
            The content includes meticulous data on such topics as land survey, demographic structure, land
                    ownership, farm crops, livestock, marketing procedures, transportation facilities, and indices of
                    agricultural growth. The 235 page volume includes 8 pages of pictures and approximately 60 graphs
                    and charts. The research in archival materials is impressive.
            In this investigation the author tries to determine if the farmers’ proximity to an urban
                    center increased or decreased their mobility, whether farm size affected per capita income, whether
                    older people maintained more permanent residence than younger people, and whether ethnic clustering
                    was typical of the township population. Conzen concludes that Madison did influence the economic
                    life of these rural people, but this impact was not as dramatic or striking as one might have
                    anticipated. Changes appear to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The conclusions seem
                    rather disappointing because there are few surprises and virtually no interesting interpretations.
                    The author suggests that studies of other townships are needed before many of the generalizations
                    can be verified.
            Although this evidence will have some interest for those living in the township, the book will have
                    little appeal for the general reader because of the writer's preoccupation with statistics
                    and the abundance of behavioral science jargon which envelopes the work. For example, it does not
                    make for exciting prose to read such statements as, "the mean number of horses per
                    farm," "the standard deviation of horses per farm," or "farm
                    value predictors based on partial correlation coefficients."
            Furthermore, the general reader will frequently get the impression that great efforts have been made
                    to prove the obvious. For instance, the reader discovers that as settlement continued, the number of
                    horses tended to increase, or that the advent of railroads facilitated  marketing of agricultural commodities, or that the farms tended to
                    increase in size, or that several ethnic groups such as Norwegians and Germans engaged in farming,
                    or that the growth of Madison tended to increase the value of land on the outskirts of the city, or
                    that the large farms were usually more prosperous than the smaller ones.
            Although the author is interested in the demographic composition of this community, he makes no
                    reference to the Indians from whom the land was taken in the first place. In a day when scholars are
                    becoming more sensitive about the role of minorities in American society, this glaring omission is
                    regrettable.

               Fields of Rich Toil: The Development of the University of Illinois College of
                        Agriculture. By Richard Gordon Moores. (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, for the
                    College of Agriculture, 1970. Pp. 266. Illustrations, notes, appendices, bibliography, index.
                    $6.95.)
            As more and more colleges and universities in the United States approach their centennial years,
                    inevitably there will be more histories written concerning their long years of progress. A
                    centennial history not only serves as a convenient benchmark for determining the growth and progress
                    of an institution but also it holds a nostalgic appeal for alumni. This history of the University of
                    Illinois College of Agriculture is no exception.
            As is true of most books on agricultural education, Fields of Rich Toil recognizes
                    that one of the most significant federal laws concerning higher education in the United States is
                    the Morrill Act of 1862. At a time when a majority of the population of the United States was
                    classified as rural this law offered financial assistance for the development of agricultural
                    technology in the land’ grant universities throughout the nation. Along with other
                    leading agricultural states Illinois used this grant to good advantage.
            Richard Gordon Moores, publication editor in the College of Agriculture of the University of
                    Illinois, presents a brief but lucid account of the successes and failures which took place during
                    the formative years of this prestigious midwestern institution of higher education. He begins his
                    narrative by citing the controversy which raged over the selection of Champaign-Urbana as the site
                    for the university and traces the institution's growth until it became recognized as one of
                    the leading agricultural and mechanical arts schools of the nation.
            
            In some respects it is unfortunate that Moores chose to present the bulk of this centennial history
                    with such great emphasis on biographical sketches. While personalities undoubtedly have had
                    considerable influence on the events that comprise this history, the author's
                    disproportionate reliance upon biographical details tends to obscure the basic purpose of the book.
                    The fact that he presents these details in delightful prose does little to alter this basic
                    criticism.
            Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the author makes only passing reference to agricultural
                    education in other land grant schools. Judicious mention of developments at its sister institutions
                    might have served as a basis for a meaningful comparison with developments at the University of
                    Illinois.
            It is generally agreed that balance is an essential ingredient of any history. While the author
                    mentions in the preface that it is his intention to concentrate upon the earlier years of the
                    College of Agriculture, his narrative spills over into the twentieth century with only superficial
                    presentation of historical events, some of which appear to have been selected at random.
            The generous space Moores allots to appendices is commendable, while the photographs and statistical
                    tables add interesting dimensions to the book. An excellent bibliography is convincing evidence that
                    the history is based upon broad and exhaustive research.
            The minor criticisms submitted by this reviewer should not obscure the book's worthwhile
                    contributions to agricultural history. Undoubtedly, Fields of Rich Toil will be
                    appreciated by all persons interested in the history of higher education in general and agriculture
                    in particular, especially by those who hail from the State of Illinois.

               Mexico. By Robert E. Quirk. The Modern Nations in Historical
                        Perspective. Edited by Robin W. Winks. (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1971.
                    Pp. viii, 152. Map, bibliographic essay, index. Clothbound, $5.95; paperbound,
                    $2.45.)
            For several years Prentice-Hall has been engaged in the publication of compact national and regional
                    histories in its series The Modern Nations in Historical Perspective, under the
                    general editorship of Robin W. Winks. Averaging well under two hundred pages in length, the books in
                    this series are restricted to major themes and patterns, but they have been strongly interpretive
                    and oriented toward present day concerns. They have been generally well received by reviewers, and
                    the key to this reception lies in the success of Winks in recruiting an able group of historians as
                    contributors. Such is the  case with the volume now under
                    consideration, for Robert E. Quirk has produced a brief interpretive history of Mexico that is a
                    suitable companion to the other works in this series.
            Two themes dominating Quirk's study are the troubled melding of races and cultures that
                    produced modern Mexican society and the evolution of Mexican political life. He takes care in
                    separating fact from myth insofar as Mexico's Indian heritage is concerned, for it is
                    Quirk's view that Spanish influence has played a greater role in shaping modern Mexican
                    society than it is fashionable to propose. Noting that it is the "ideal" and
                    "mythic" Indian of the Aztec empire that is venerated in Mexico today, he adds
                    that "the empire ceased to exist in 1521 and therefore contributed almost nothing to
                    Mexico's postconquest civilization" (p. 21). Spanish institutions and attitudes
                    are not honored by the rhetoric of the Revolution, Quirk argues, "yet despite the
                    disclaimers of politicians and intellectuals, the aristocratic traditions still have a strong hold
                    on Mexican society" (p. 47).
            Quirk's discussion of Mexico's political development is structured along familiar
                    lines as he moves through each stage from the period of Santa Anna to the era of Revolutionary
                    Mexico. He characterizes nineteenth century political life as an ideological struggle between
                    conservative forces fighting a rear guard action and liberals whose day had not yet come, and he
                    notes that in the process "the early optimism of the liberals yielded to the harsh reality
                    that the country was not ready for a popularly determined government" (p. 52). Liberals
                    ultimately joined conservatives in accepting the strong man rule of Porfirio Diaz as they wearied of
                    the years of internal dissension, and Mexico went into a period of stability, rapid economic
                    development, and vast profits for favored Mexican and foreign investors.
            It is, understandably, the era of the Revolution with which Quirk is most effective. His final
                    chapter is a careful assessment of the gains and failures of the Revolution under the
                    "juggernaut" Party of Revolutionary Institutions. Noting the growing disaffection
                    and alienation on both the political right and left of PRI, and, more importantly, the revolt of
                    Mexican youth, Quirk questions whether Mexico can long continue on its present path. "Most
                    Mexicans," he observes, "though disillusioned with the Revolution, would vote
                    overwhelmingly for PRI's candidates in the 1970s, because they had no other
                    choice" (p. 125). He adds that even by 1970, however, "the new generation had
                    broken with the past and looked to the Echeverria years ahead—a few with guarded hope,
                    many with cynicism, and some with anticipation of violent social upheaval" (p. 125).
            Despite its brevity, Professor Quirk's study is challenging, and it should prove to be a
                    useful instrument in college classrooms. The bibliographic essay is excellent.

               Constitution Making in Indiana: A Source Book of Constitutional Documents with
                        Historical Introduction and Critical Notes. Volume I, 1780–1851. By Charles Kettleborough. Indiana Historical
                    Collections, Volume I. Reprint. (Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Bureau, 1971. Pp. ccxli, 530,
                    Notes, index. $7.50.) In 1916 Charles Kettleborough published a two volume history of
                    constitution making in Indiana for the one hundred years from 1816–1916. Kettleborough
                    stated in his preface: "The documents comprised in these two volumes are designed to
                    illustrate and interpret the constitutional growth and development of the State of Indiana from the
                    beginnings of its institutional history to the present. ... an attempt has been made to include
                    every document of a constitutional character" (p. vii). In 1930 the author added a third
                    volume to the set, covering the years 1916–1930. Although long out of print these
                    invaluable references are the standard works on constitutional development in the Hoosier State. The
                    Indiana Historical Bureau is now reprinting Kettleborough's two initial volumes and plans
                    to issue a revised and updated third volume. Volume I contains an excellent, comprehensive
                    introduction and documents which range from those pertaining to the cession of the Northwest
                    Territory to the Constitution of 1851. The Indiana Historical Bureau cannot be too highly commended
                    for reissuing and updating these three volumes. Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana

               Orange County Heritage. Compiled by Arthur L. Dillard. (Privately printed: The
                    author, 1971. Pp. vi, 240. Illustrations, notes. $6.50.) Dillard and a dozen or so other
                    authors have contributed to this volume which provides "a sampling of the economic,
                    political, religious, and social factors that have been fundamental in the development of Orange
                    County, Indiana" (Preface). Some of the articles are taken from previous publications, but
                    this collection makes them available to additional readers in an appropriate and convenient way.
                    Various of the sketches are unusually interesting and quite informative. The reviewer found those
                    concerning Dr. William A. Bowles and the whetstone industry particularly fascinating. Individuals
                    searching for a new approach to the writing of county or other local history should give thoughtful
                    attention to this volume. Dillard merits commendation for having produced one of the most
                    significant volumes concerning local history which this reviewer has seen in recent years.
            
               One Hundred Men: A Legislative History of Morgan County, Indiana. By Judge Noble K.
                    Littell. (Privately printed: The author,  1971. Pp. v, 135.
                    Illustrations, bibliography, index. $10.00.) Judge Littell has plowed some new ground in
                    this compact volume which consists principally of biographical sketches of the approximately one
                    hundred men who have represented Morgan County in the Indiana General Assembly. The author is to be
                    commended for this interesting and resourceful approach to the study of local history. His account
                    of legislators from Morgan County affords a valuable sample of the kind of men who have served in
                    the Indiana General Assembly since statehood. As Littell's study indicates, Morgan County
                    has often been a battleground between Republicans (and Whigs) and Democrats. Though lawyers have
                    frequently represented the county in the General Assembly, farmers, merchants, ministers, and others
                    have served also. As a group these men have indeed been "citizen legislators,"
                    including Littell himself, who was a member of the House of Representatives during the early 1960s.
                    According to the Preface, One Hundred Men is a delayed contribution to the Indiana
                    State Sesquicentennial of 1966. The Preface also suggests that the author is now at work on a
                    history of Masonry at Eminence and also on a sketch of the Littell family tree.
            
               Seventy Years of First Church of Christ, Garrett, Indiana. By Lois Cobler.
                    (Garrett: Bartels Printing, 1971. Pp. 231. Illustrations, appendix, index of names listed.
                    Paperbound, $4.25.) Lois Cobler has written a sympathetic and profusely illustrated
                    history of the First Church of Christ at Garrett, Indiana, for approximately the period 1900 to
                    1970. She details numerous facets of the church's activities, efforts, and achievements
                    since its beginnings in the initial decade of this century.
            
               The Politics of American Labor: The Indiana Microcosm. By Melvin A. Kahn.
                    (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Labor Institute, 1970. Pp. xxi, 330. Notes, tables,
                    appendices, bibliography, index, personal interviews. Paperbound, Free.) This book is apparently a
                    reprint of a volume which originally appeared in 1964 under the title of Labor and the
                        Law-Making Process. Though written by one who is openly sympathetic to labor and its basic
                    aspirations, nonetheless it affords an informative and frank analysis of the organizational pattern,
                    economic and political aspirations, personnel and other divisions, and basic trends within organized
                    labor in Indiana of recent decades, with emphasis on the fifties and early sixties. Kahn insists
                    that the political effort of organized labor in Indiana is a microcosm for organized labor
                    nationally. Persons interested in achieving an increased understanding concerning recent
                    developments in and the contemporary status of organized labor in Indiana will find this volume a
                    helpful guide.
            
            
               Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years. By
                    Paul Simon. Reprint. (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1971. Pp. xii, 335. Notes,
                    illustrations, index. Clothbound, $6.95; paperbound, $2.95.) "This is
                    the story of Abraham Lincoln's service in his first elective office, the public office he
                    held longer than any other" (p. vii). Thus Simon introduces his volume covering
                    Lincoln's eight years in the Illinois state legislature. Very little has been written about
                    the Civil War President's legislative career in Illinois, and much which has appeared is
                    open to question. Simon has attempted to present a scholarly account of Lincoln as a state
                    legislator and—although an amateur historian—has closely approached his goal.
                    The author's own career as an Illinois legislator, state officer, and politician provides
                    background and understanding for his treatment of Lincoln. General readers will find this reprint
                    volume interesting; scholars will find it useful. Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana

                    $7.95.) Few pictorial histories have been better conceived and executed than this volume
                    on Kentucky. Arranged both chronologically and topically the book presents an amazingly well
                    balanced coverage of the Bluegrass State in subject matter—from politics and industry
                    through education and crafts to sports and the horse; in time—from prehistory to Kentucky
                    today; and in presentation—in photographs, maps, sketches, and text. The preface, written
                    by Associate Editor Thomas D. Clark, perhaps best summarizes this beautiful volume: "Caught
                    in the focus of the photographer's lens or on an artist's canvas ... [Kentucky]
                    stands revealed in its power, its starkness, sometimes in ugliness, but always in detail. ... This
                    volume is wide ranging in scope of space and time, institutional growth, in humanity, and, most of
                    all, in portraying the changes of a dynamic society" (p. 7). Lorna Lutes

                    Notes, appendices, indices. $25.00.) In February, 1861, a peace convention proposed by
                    the Virginia General Assembly met at Washington, D. C., to discuss possible means of averting
                    further secession and civil war. Although the convention's sessions were conducted
                    secretly, Delegate L. E. Chittenden of Vermont in 1864 published the complete  proceedings of the conference based on his extensive notes. Chittenden
                    did "not claim to have furnished a verbatim report" but asserted
                    that his work provided "an accurate account of all ... official proceedings,"
                    speeches, and propositions, "generally ... presented ... in the very language
                    used" (p. 7). This reprint of Chittenden's volume provides a valuable supplement
                    to recent works on the Washington Peace Conference. Hoosiers may also be interested in determining
                    whether or not Indiana's delegates fulfilled the pledges made to Governor Oliver P. Morton
                    prior to their appointments. Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University,

               Thurlow Weed: Wizard of the Lobby. By Glyndon G. Van Deusen. Reprint. The American Scene: Comments and Commentators. Edited by Wallace D. Farnham. (New York: Da
                    Capo Press, 1969. Pp. xiv, 403. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. $15.00.) Van
                    Deusen's biography of Weed, first published in 1947, has become recognized as an excellent
                    biography of the Whig, then Republican, party leader and boss. It well merits a reprint edition.
            
               The Reinterpretation of American Economic History. Edited by Robert William Fogel
                    and Stanley L. Engerman. (New York: Harper & Row, Publishers, 1971. Pp. xxiv, 494. Notes,
                    references, tables, figures, charts, appendices, index. $12.95.) Though principally
                    intended for use by teachers and students in undergraduate courses in American history and
                    economics, the some three dozen essays in this volume are worthwhile to those who have a special
                    interest in American history. They give a heavy emphasis to research based upon the use of
                    quantitative techniques to interpret varied facets of American economic history. The essays raise
                    more questions than they answer, but if read with care, they will stir the thinking of and afford
                    new insights to all save those whose academic arteries have hardened beyond repair.
            
               Alexander Campbell at Glasgow University, 1808–1809. Transcribed with an
                    introduction by Lester G. McAllister. (Nashville, Tenn.: Disciples of Christ Historical Society,
                    1971. Pp. 101. Illustration. $3.50.) This book includes essays and related papers written
                    by Alexander Campbell while a student at Glasgow University, Scotland, during 1808–1809.
                    It and the editor's introduction give a helpful background for an understanding of the
                    intellectual and theological baggage which Campbell brought with him when he came to the United
                    States in 1809. This modest volume supplies considerable evidence that the spiritual father of the
                    Disciples of Christ had a significant exposure to formal education. The issue of Encounter, in which this text was initially published, is available for
                $2.00.

            Society of Indiana Archivists
            A group of Hoosier archivists have recently formed the Society of Indiana Archivists. Membership is
                    open to all Hoosiers and organizations interested in collecting and preserving manuscripts and
                    permanent archives needed to provide adequate documentation for Indiana history.
            The organizers plan several areas of action: help and information for Indiana record
                    depositories—including religious, business, university, and county
                    archives—which seek counsel concerning a proper program of archival management, aid to
                    members through discussions and technical programs, publications for loan through a technical
                    library, and analysis of unique Indiana archival problems through the publication of a newsletter
                    and a technical leaflet series.
            The first meeting of SIA will be at the DePauw University Library, Greencastle, on Saturday,
                    September 16, 1972. An organizational meeting will begin at 10 A. M. followed by lunch and an
                    informal period to meet archivists and curators specializing in various areas, to evaluate archival
                    supplies, and to learn of archival programs such as microphotography. The program will feature a
                    speaker and will end by 3:30 P.M.
            For further information write to John J. Newman, Society of Indiana Archivists, Indiana State
