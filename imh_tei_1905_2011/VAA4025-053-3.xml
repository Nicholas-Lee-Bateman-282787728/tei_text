            <p>Times were hard in 1840. Laborers worked for fifty cents a day, farm hands for "bed and
                    board," and they were glad to get it. Canal diggers who averaged but $110 a year
                    lost their jobs entirely in August, 1839, when the State of Indiana went bankrupt and stopped
                    virtually all its public works.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The firm of Comparet and Kiser in <placeName>

                    far removed from wilderness, dependent upon the whimsical forces of nature. Northern Indiana was
                    very sparsely settled, and most of the population lived in central and southern Indiana.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Though its population multiplied six times from 1830 to 1840, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName> could boast of less than six thousand inhabitants in 1840, the great majority of whom
                    devoted themselves to clearing very primitive farms. The fur trade with the Miami Indians was still
                    lively, but Indian corn provided the largest cash crop, 84,275 bushels in 1840. Ingenious Hoosiers
                    had discovered that the cheapest and most convenient way to get corn to market, if not perhaps the
                    most palatable way to consume it, was in the form of whiskey. Thus there was a distillery, and the
                    rudimentary beginnings of commerce and industry. A weekly newspaper, three flour mills, two grist
                    mills, a pottery, a tannery, and the aforementioned distillery kept some 265 workers employed.
                    Twenty-eight citizens practiced what the census taker listed as the "learned
                    professions," 166 engaged in mining, 52 in commerce, and six were employed in the
                    navigation of canals and rivers. As yet there were only primary schools, and 160 citizens over
                    twenty years of age frankly admitted that they could neither read nor write. According to the census
                    taker, at least, no one in the entire county formally classified as either idiot or insane.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                    Whigs lost no time in turning such economic frustration into partisan fervor. Their denunciations
                    were fluent and careless of fact: "Down with Martin Van Ruin," they shouted;
                    "away with the Spoilers!"</p>
            <p>The followers of Jefferson and Jackson had been in power for forty years. Eleven years had passed
                    since the western partisans of Andrew Jackson first muddied the carpets of the White House, and the
                    aggressive vigor which had characterized their arrival in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was considerably diminished. In 1837 General Jackson had retired to the Hermitage,
                    leaving Martin Van Buren, "the Little Magician," to maintain the Democracy by
                    political sorcery. Little Van's incantations proved to be competent enough but no
                    substitute for the decisive and colorful leadership of the Old Chieftain. Harassed by hard times,
                    the suave President found it difficult to inspire renewed enthusiasm in his plebeian followers.
                    Indeed, the paradox of a people's party under the leadership of a courtly, luxury-loving
                    politician gave the Whigs a most damaging issue in the contest of 1840.</p>
            <p>With the help of a more literate ghost writer, Davy Crockett, "the Coonskin
                    Congressman" from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, zeroed his vitriolic pen on the hapless Van Buren. Crockett's political
                    marksmanship apparently had the same deadly effect as his huntsman's skill with Old Betsy.
                    Davy's <hi rend="i">Life of Martin Van Buren</hi> advertised its sophisticated subject as
                    "a <hi rend="i">slippery</hi> fellow," "a dandy," who crept
                    stealthily into "<hi rend="i">genteel society</hi>" and who traveled the
                    countryside "in an English coach" with "English servants, dressed in
                    … livery." "He is laced up in corsets, such as women in a town wear,
                    and, if possible, tighter than the best of them," said Davy, who found it difficult to
                    discern from the President's "personal appearance, whether he was a man or woman,
                    but for his large <hi rend="i">red</hi> and <hi rend="i">gray</hi> whiskers." "He
                    struts and swaggers like a crow in a gutter," Crockett concluded in a description
                    calculated to terminate Van Buren's political life.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    </placeName> to name their candidates. Rejecting their traditional spokesmen, Henry Clay and Daniel
                    Webster, Whig leaders turned to William Henry Harrison who epitomized the new political importance
                    of the West, and whose opinions were sufficiently ambiguous to offend none of the many divergent
                    elements in the party. When the disappointed <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Harrisburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he was reported to have exclaimed, "My friends are not worth the powder and
                    shot it would take to kill them! … If there were two Henry Clays, one of them would make

            </p>
            <p>To complete the ticket, Whig managers chose John Tyler of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, an austere, conservative, states' rights southerner who was said to have wept
                    at the Mill Boy's defeat. In recalling the convention later, at least one devoted Whig
                    bemoaned the addition of "And Tyler too" to the ticket. "There was
                    rhyme," he sighed, "but no reason in it."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> In 1840,
                    however, expediency made rhyme and reason synonymous, for federalists of the North and strict
                    constructionists of the South could perhaps march together to the chant of the compelling
                    alliteration: "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> and Tyler too."</p>
            <p>The problem of unity thus solved by their ticket, Whigs had only to keep the campaign from becoming
                    entangled with controversial issues. "The General's lips must be hermetically
                    sealed," advised one astute New Yorker, "and our shouts and hurras must be long
                    and loud." In accomplishing their objectives, Whigs fortuitously received inadvertent help
                    from blundering Democrats who repeated gibes about "Old Granny" Harrison. A

                    to the White House. "Give him a barrel of hard cider," said this tactless

            <p>Representative Charles Ogle of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> gave the campaign its keynote in a speech in Congress on "The Regal Splendor
                    of the President's Palace." In describing the most intimate details of
                    "palace life," the Keystone Congressman accused Van Buren of installing the first
                    bathtub in the White House. For three uproarious days, Ogle harangued his colleagues. Among other
                    things, he complained because the President's table was "not provided with those
                    old and unfashionable dishes, `hog and hominy,'" "schnitz" and
                    "sour-crout," to say nothing of "hard cider." He denounced the
                    purchase of mirrors for the "grand banquet hall." "What," asked
                    Ogle, "would the frugal and honest `Hoosiers' think were they to behold a
                    democratic peacock in full court costume, strutting by the hour before golden-framed mirrors, nine
                    feet high and four and a half feet wide!" His climax of course came with the revelation
                    that a bathtub had been put in Van Buren's chambers. Apparently "Sweet Sandy
                    Whiskers" (as he disrespectfully referred to the President) was not content to bathe, as
                    John Quincy Adams had, in the turbid waters of the Potomac. Only one with the desires of an Oriental
                    autocrat would demand so extravagant a luxury as a bath! A President with tastes so effete might
                    indeed supply his toilet with "Double Extract of Queen Victora [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>In contrast to this Asiatic splendor of Van Buren, Whigs heralded the rugged virtues of "the
                    Ploughman Candidate for President." The contest was interpreted as one between the simple
                    and the aristocratic ways of life: the log cabin versus the palace; hard cider versus champagne; Old <placeName>

            <p>Confronted with arguments for log cabins and hard cider, bewildered Democratic politicians responded
                    with the traditional palaver of their trade. They described Old Tip as senile, charged him with
                    duplicity, belittled his military record. In one of the truly ingenious developments of the canvass,

                    "O.K. Club." Shortly thereafter the mystery of the symbol was clarified.
                    "O.K." stood for Martin Van Buren, "Old Kinderhook," whose noisy
                    followers shouted it as a term of identification while disrupting a Whig meeting. But soon Whig

                            and better breeds of stock. The story is that on one occasion he was asked what he thought
                            of the new hydraulic rams. Not being acquainted with this mechanical device, the governor
                            responded that he thought farmers should experiment with these rams in their efforts to

                    the political forum because society had no other way than by political action to settle any
                    question. A new school system was being established by the state; a system of railroads was being
                    built, each road requiring a charter by the state; a State Board of Agriculture created by the state
                    was attempting to place agriculture on a scientific basis; a state system of benevolence and charity
                    was being established under state control and support. Thus it was not accidental that every citizen
                    was a politician. During the fifties a prohibition law was placed on the statute books, though there
                    was serious objection to the state's entering the field of morals.</p>
            <p>Individually and personally society was just passing from the pioneer stage. It was an agricultural

            <p>Sixty per cent of the manufacturing was still done in the home and the remainder in the little

            <p>The fashion in eighteenth century Europe of family orchestras performing their own compositions was
                    vanishing from the scene by the late nineteenth century. America, though still somewhat dependent on
                    Europe musically, did not adopt the fashion of family group performances. The trend for the average
                    American was to become a spectator rather than a performer; this led to a small but select group of
                    performers and to some decline in appreciation of music on the part of audiences.</p>

                    at the residence of Judge John S. Tarkington for the purpose of helping the newsboys' home.
                    The program was reported to be delightful and the audience, though only fair in size, was
                    "super-fair in quality." Moreover, a "comfortable amount of money was
                    netted." The reporter concluded that " `parlor concerts' should

                    become skilled amateur or professional performers, and at the same time gave opportunity for large
                    numbers of interested persons to participate in musical activities. Vocal music was far more popular
                    than instrumental music. Although there were probably never less than two bands in active
                    organization, and each musical society maintained an orchestra as well as a chorus, most of the
                    performances gave principal expression to vocal music. Musicians who came from other cities either
                    for individual concerts or to participate in the May festivals were principally vocalists.</p>
            <p>Among the instrumentalists active during the seventies was the Philharmonic Society. One of their
                    evening concerts included compositions by Mendelssohn, Schumann, Strauss, and Schubert. Many of the

                    be assumed that they were paid little or nothing for the balance of that year. In order to support

                    held at Exchange Hall was a financial failure. Organ concerts were held occasionally; one by a
                    Professor Clarke at the First Baptist Church was much enjoyed by a fair-sized audience despite the

                    encouraged, a few weeks later another group of fourteen ladies organized a cornet band under the

            <p>Henry D. Beissenherz was almost a musical institution in himself. During this decade he conducted a
                    band which gave concerts at intervals. For many years thereafter, his organization furnished music
                    for English's Opera House and for a wide variety of public gatherings. However, in 1879 his
                    benefit concert failed financially, although the audience of a few hundred was appreciative
                    "almost to the point of rudeness." This failure may be partly explained by the
                    fact that two other programs were held the same evening, one by the Harmonic Chorus Society, and the

                    situation occurred again during the next decade when the theatrical competition was keen.</p>
            <p>A few weeks before his benefit concert, Beissenherz had proposed leasing six acres on the north side

                    </placeName> Street bridge, for a summer garden where full brass band concerts would be held twice a
                    week. This plan was contingent on the extension of the streetcar line from the corner of Twelfth
                    Street to the proposed garden, a distance of half a mile.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> If this garden was
                    in fact established, it was probably a forerunner of the Fairbanks Garden of the 1890's
                    which was located at approximately the same place. At the latter garden music entertained the
                    patrons who were seated at outdoor tables where light refreshments were available. Several such
                    gardens were to be found in the city in the 1870's, particularly along East <placeName>

                    </placeName>, appeared before an unusually small but select audience at Masonic Hall, April 25,
                    1874. The program, especially arranged as a farewell concert for Professor Thomas N. Caulfield,
                    included several other musicians who performed before the appearance of Miss Rive. A newspaper
                    critic stated that she was "without doubt the finest lady pianist ever to come before an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    of 1876, and again in 1877 when she was announced as Mme Julia Rive-King. Though her audiences were
                    not always large, they were highly appreciative and regarded her as the "most wonderful of

                    and animation as she exhibited at the beginning. At the close the audience paid her a rare tribute
                    and "remained motionless after the last tones had died away, unwilling to believe the
                    performance at an end."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>In 1876 a world-famous pianist, Hans von Bülow, offered two concerts in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The small audience at first seemed cold and unsympathetic until "warmed and
                    enthused by the consummate genius of the artist." Hopeful that the next would see a full

                    report another "slim house." Since music lovers of the city had turned out en
                    masse for performances less meritorious, the cause of this apparent lack of enthusiasm was probably
                    the "close financial times." Two dollars seemed altogether too much to pay to hear
                    only one performer, even though he were first class, for even in such times people often willingly
                    paid more to hear an opera troupe with a large chorus. Moreover, von Bülow was suspected
                    of being in the pay of a piano manufacturer! So the two-dollar admission was regarded as extortion
                    or fraud by the public who refused to patronize the concert. All this "in vindication of <placeName>

            <p>In the field of group vocal music, the earliest and greatest contribution was made by the Germans.
                    The example set by the Maennerchor and other German singing societies was followed by several
                    societies featuring English language singing. In the German group, the Maennerchor, established in
                    1854, sponsored the elaborate Saengerfest of 1867, which at that time consisted of only thirty
                    members. From 1873 to 1880 the Maennerchor was under the direction of Max Leckner and was often

                    Hall and police court room, it was completely redecorated with frescoed ceilings and walls. A large
                    stage was built in the south end and equipped with a scenic drop curtain painted by August Metzner.
                    The gallery was converted into a refreshment room with tables, the old committee room below into a
                    restaurant, and the second floor into club rooms. Thus the entire building was a sort of assembly
                    hall for all the German societies. The moving-in was accompanied by a procession around the city
                    with torches and Chinese lanterns, followed by a program of music and speeches—a notable
                    event in the history of the German organization.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> The hall was then dedicated

            <p>The regular season for Maennerchor activities usually began in middle or late October and ended the
                    latter part of May. Monthly rehearsals, sometimes referred to as concerts, were held at which other
                    soloists and singing societies often participated. After the musical part of the program was
                    concluded, the floor would be cleared and dancing "indulged in to a late hour."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> In April, 1878, arrangements were made for fortnightly concerts, and the
                    Maennerchor and Philharmonic societies planned to unite under the name of the German Singing
                    Society. In addition to the regular season's activities, the Maennerchor, loath to cease
                    musical activity entirely through the summer, generally gave a "summer night's
                    festival" at a suitable place, such as the Phoenix Garden at the corner of Meridian and
                    Morris streets. There would be a concert, festoons of lights, banners, fireworks at intervals, and
                    dancing until late in the evening. The festival in 1878 also provided a convenient meeting place for
                    politicians and candidates who were evident in large numbers.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

                    of 1879 one such incident occurred, and the Maennerchor anniversary festival which was scheduled for
                    September was not held until the following spring, "owing to a slight disruption among the
                    members." All former active members were urged to participate in the "festival

                    the proposal and proceeded to elect Carl H. Weegmann director. The Lyra at this time was said to be

            <p>Another German singing society, the Liederkranz, maintained an active program during this period.

                    probably performed a lighter, more popular type of music. On one occasion, the Liederkranz concert
                    elicited much enthusiasm from its large audience which had come to the program despite the

            <p>Membership in German singing societies was usually confined to men, but women had their societies,
                    too, and often held separate entertainments. Such an event was the summer night's festival

                    and the Cecilian Glee Club. The Choral Union, oldest of these groups, was founded in 1869 and by
                    1877 had nearly a hundred members. Factional strife divided this group, just as it had the Germans,
                    and in 1875 the Harmonic Society was formed by these dissenters. Despite efforts to reunite the

                    Harmonic Society, was the cultivation of music among the people of the community. The type of music
                    generally prepared for public performance was the oratorio and other music of sacred character. The
                    Choral Union performed <hi rend="i">The Messiah, Judas Maccabaeus, The Creation, The Seasons,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="i">Elijah,</hi> performing seven oratorios in the first eight years of its

            </p>
            <p>The Choral Union flourished under the direction of Emil Wulschner as had the Lyra Society. In 1878
                    the <hi rend="i">News</hi> stated that there had never been "so much enthusiasm in any of
                    our home societies as … in the union since Wulschner assumed the baton."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> He apparently directed both the chorus and the orchestra at the concert held
                    that season in the First Baptist Church. The immense audience so entirely filled the pews, aisles,
                    galleries, and vestibules of the church that many were turned away. In spite of the overcrowding the
                    audience seemed thoroughly pleased with the excellent performance. The critic, trying to be
                    objective, stated: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>As the decade advanced the Choral Union appeared to increase in popularity, as indicated by the
                    quality and degree of appreciation of the audiences. This success was doubtless to some degree the
                    result of occasional lectures given in the interest of musical culture. As early as 1874 J. Henry
                    Kappes addressed the members urging a strong program of musical education. He pointed out examples
                    of progress in music and the fine arts, evidences which indicated to him that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Meridian City, might eventually supplant <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> in culture and that it might then be called "the Hub!"<hi rend="sup">49</hi> On the tenth anniversary of the Choral Union in June, 1879, the Reverend Edward A.
                    Bradley urged raising a fund for the establishment of a conservatory of music in <placeName>

                    </placeName>,<hi rend="sup">50</hi> so that musical culture need not depend solely on the work of
                    various clubs, purely voluntary groups, but would be supported instead by an establishment with a
                    continuous and progressive program in operation.</p>
            <p>The Harmonic Society, the other "oratorio-singing society," proceeded under the
                    baton of W. H. Clarke and secured a regular place for its meetings soon after its organization.
                    William H. Clarke and Company, organ builders," had secured a building occupied by Trinity
                    Church at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> and North streets and planned to fit it up as an organ studio and exhibition hall. The
                    terraced stage would provide room for a hundred singers and a fine two-manual organ was to be
                    installed. The new Harmonic Chorus Society planned to give regular monthly invitational concerts of
                    classical and other types of music.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>General public reaction, however, was somewhat less enthusiastic for the Harmonic Society than for
                    the Choral Union. In 1876 a program was rather coolly received by the small audience, and the
                    reporter was inclined to criticize the society for its lack of preparation.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
                    Yet, later that season a fine audience attended the performance of Costa's <hi rend="i">Naaman</hi> at the Grand Opera House, and the affair was declared successful. Among the
                    soloists was the young contralto, Sallie Bingham, and others of equally professional caliber. One

                    a flat financial failure. The audience, only slightly larger than the chorus, was generally

            <p>Concerts of these societies were probably of the paid-admission variety, so that the hard times of
                    the seventies would have had a direct effect upon attendance. Moreover, the total number of citizens
                    who might be depended upon to swell the attendance of musical affairs was not large. Thus, if too
                    many performances were scheduled for the same evening, someone would certainly have to sing to empty
                    benches.</p>
            <p>Attendance at the opera was always good, for this was a social event for the upper classes as well as
                    an opportunity for genuine music lovers. It was the fashionable thing to go to the opera. Since the
                    amount and kind of public entertainment for the well-to-do was somewhat limited, opera became a
                    "must" for them. Nevertheless, the depression had some effect on opera in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Most companies were well received, but some were plagued by financial difficulty. In
                    1875 at the two performances of the Strakosch Italian Opera Company, the audiences were small and

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. No early winter season of opera was booked in 1877, nor any for the spring season in
                    1878, probably as a result of the hard times. The 1878–1879 schedule was more nearly
                    equal to that of 1873–1874.</p>
            <p>Of some interest in connection with the success or failure of an operatic season was the scheduling
                    and local management of opera by the legitimate theater. Theatrical managers brought opera companies
                    to the city as a part of their season's program. This enabled them to vary their schedule
                    with burlesque or minstrels to make up for any deficit they might have sustained because of the
                    failure of an operatic season. Apparently no special agency managed or scheduled concerts of
                    out-of-town artists or operatic performances. The appearance of expert professional musicians seems
                    to be somewhat uncertain and haphazard until the 1890's when Ona B. Talbot took over the
                    concert management. The scheduling of opera continued in the legitimate theater probably because it
                    required the facilities of the theaters, or opera houses, as they were called.</p>
            <p>Thoughout the decade of the seventies several of the more serious operas were performed but the
                    lighter type was more popular; at least two performances of each of the following were given: <hi rend="i">The Chimes of Normandy, The Bohemian Girl,</hi> and <hi rend="i">H. M. S.

                    Company during the 1878-1879 season.</p>
            <p>The opera <hi rend="i">Belshazzar, King of Babylon,</hi> produced in 1875, was a most ambitious
                    undertaking for the Cecilian Glee Club. The entire Philharmonic Orchestra and a full brass band
                    especially organized for the occasion assisted the larger chorus. Costumes valued at four thousand

                            into the lobbies was so illmannered that it deserves the first notice. During the overture
                            men went to and fro as the original Mephistopheles did when he mingled with the sons of men

            <p>The earliest mention of ticket scalpers during this period was in March, 1879. When tickets were
                    placed on sale for performances of the Strakosch Opera Company, scheduled the following week, the
                    usual rush to the box office did not occur, for speculators had purchased blocks of tickets and were
                    selling them elsewhere. Upon investigation the reporter encountered Thomas Taylor, agent for the
                    George C. Boniface Company which was billed for an appearance the following week. The agent
                    maintained that speculation was a fair practice, that in <placeName>

                    speculator and agent would work together and share the profits. <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>After the great wave of German immigration—the coming of the Forty-eighters preceding the
                    Civil War—many more German immigrants arrived in the early seventies. Within a short time
                    these people were finding expression in various community activities, especially music, and were
                    making a valuable cultural contribution. Large numbers of Germans settled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as well as in other midwestern cities, such as <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and many musical societies were established. Saengerfests had been held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as well as in other cities, and now, in the eighties, this activity spread beyond the
                    German societies into other musical groups and there arose in <placeName>

                    </placeName> a common desire to organize large music festivals similar to those held in other
                    cities. Some preferred a regular series of fine concerts rather than festivals for the reason that
                    good music should be heard at more frequent intervals throughout the year and not just at festivals.
                    At any rate, the festivals were appreciated by the residents of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and much credit was given to the Germans for their contribution. Musical taste in the
                    Inland City had progressed considerably during the preceding generation.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another trend typical of the "golden" decade, 1880–1890, was the
                    popularity of light opera and the local urge to produce it. Group musical performances had found
                    such favor in the various choral societies that when the Gilbert and Sullivan works began to appear
                    musicians in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> at once took them up. Amateur groups produced these and other light operas throughout
                    the decade. Both light opera and the music festivals encouraged increased participation in musical
                    activities and wider appreciation by the general public. The German societies by perfecting their
                    organizations and giving concerts under the batons of well-paid professional directors, and often
                    using outside soloists, set a standard which effectively raised the level of musical culture in the

                    assist departing musicians both morally and financially; and of course the concerts of the singing
                    societies and the festivals gave added experience to these novices. A few were fortunate in winning
                    places in operatic companies in the East, but local companies provided some opportunities for those
                    less fortunate. Katie McDowell was one of those who secured an engagement with an eastern company.

                    Grand Opera House. This was the occasion for comment on the work of the popular voice teacher:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Professor J. S. Black's annual concerts have always shown a high degree of
                            excellence, and his work here has developed some of the finest singers the city has had. It
                            is not saying too much to assert that the high state of musical culture here is due more to
                            Professor Black than any other one person.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> As for the son, he thoroughly pleased his audience and was regarded by some as superior to
                    all the professional baritones who had sung in the city. It was pointed out that more substantial
                    recognition than mere praise might be accorded him. Inasmuch as he was a Hoosier and had been reared
                    in the capital of the state, his success, it was hoped, would encourage other talented Hoosiers. A
                    critic suggested that Indianians might bear testimony to their regard for Mr. Black by recalling him
                    from Europe to appear at the next May festival instead of engaging a foreign singer of less ability.

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Chorus had voted to combine with the Mendelssohn Society under the leadership of

                    dissolve. Its membership, reduced to ninety-three, paid no dues and proceeds from concerts provided
                    the only source of revenue. These concerts apparently were not financially successful, for the
                    treasury was depleted and all the officers together with the director, Ora Pearson, expressed their

                    descent, in the 1880's there was an increasing number of associate members, people who
                    appreciated the opportunity to sing with other talented musicians and joined forces with them in the
                    performance of the best music. No English-speaking singing society of any prominence was active at
                    that time; so the Maennerchor performed a useful service.<hi rend="sup">128</hi>

            <p>The progress of the Maennerchor was steady under the direction of Carl Barus. In 1886 the first
                    regular concert of the season was attended by a large and enthusiastic audience. The
                    singers' voices seemed to be at their best and the orchestra was in full accord, while the
                    genial conductor appeared "like a father with a great, happy family around
                        him."<hi rend="sup">129</hi> In 1889 the society varied its activities with a fair, the

                        money.<hi rend="sup">131</hi> Certainly no great profits at any time accrued from the concerts,
                    but neither did a deficit occur. From three concerts in the 1884–1885 season resulted a

            <p>The Lyra Society, rival of the Maennerchor, had a large membership and a fine hall. In 1883 Reinhold

                    music had sprung up so that a national music was beginning to develop which would be characteristic
                    of our national life. The city was elaborately decorated for the event and a parade a mile long

                    1888, and 1893. The first festival was conceived as a means to raise money for the
                    Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, and it was planned to make this an annual affair.
                    However, the state legislature passed a law in March, 1887, appropriating money for the Monument
                    fund; so no festival was held that year or the next. Still, the 1886 festival and similar festivals
                    in other cities had been so successful that a permanent festival association was soon formed and
                    performances were resumed in 1889.<hi rend="sup">141</hi>

                    Monument, the Grand Army of the Republic was actively interested and, to heighten the enthusiasm,
                    invited General William T. Sherman to be the special guest of the city on the second day of the
                    concerts. The chorus and orchestra, directed by Carl Barus, had been augmented with professional

                    hall, including the stone courthouse fence and the roofs of nearby buildings, was packed with the
                    curious. Many in the large audience were formally dressed. The chief difficulty encountered by one
                    observer in the rear of the auditorium was his struggle to see around the many large
                    ladies' hats that were being worn that season. No one dared to suggest that the hats be
                    removed—the ladies might feel insulted! The audience was a fine one and pleased Miss
                    Lehmann, who thought Americans very warm and appreciative in contrast to what she had been told
                    abroad. She expressed pleasure at the amount of musical appreciation and the good manners of <placeName>

                    </placeName> citizens. She thought Americans possessed good hearts for music and were much more

            <p>On June 7 and 8 the American Opera Company and the Theodore Thomas orchestra gave concerts as part of
                    the festival which helped swell the monument fund. At the close the receipts totaled ten thousand
                    dollars and of this amount it was expected that the profits would be between four and five thousand
                    dollars. The chorus of 650 voices could easily have been much larger, as not all the musicians of
                    the city had exerted themselves; but much of the success achieved was due to the efforts of Carl
                    Barus and the Maennerchor.<hi rend="sup">144</hi>

            <p>On July 4–6, 1887, a festival was held as part of the convention of the National Music
                    Teachers' Association. The first of these concerts emphasized American composers while the
                    second was devoted to European classics. The artistry of the performances surpassed the 1886
                    festival, and the audiences were highly appreciative. The number attending increased at the second
                    and third concerts so greatly that it may be assumed that local music lovers were taking advantage
                    of the events. Sallie Bingham was the only local singer mentioned on the program. Max Leckner, local
                    music teacher, was elected president of the Association. Though the receipts were six thousand
                    dollars, the committee found that a deficit of two thousand dollars existed, and it was necessary to
                    call on the guarantors for an assessment of about 30 per cent of the amount allowed.<hi rend="sup">145</hi>

            <p>Early in January, 1889, the May Festival Association was formed and a board of directors elected.
                    Nearly two hundred attended the first meeting of the chorus and by April 1 the number increased to
                    over seven hundred. In February the agent of Gilmore's Band arrived to assist in

                    conducted, Clarence Forsythe, local music teacher, directed the chorus, and Barclay Walker served as
                    organist. The railroads cooperated with the festival by offering special excursion rates.</p>
            <p>The days of the festival, May 27–29, finally arrived, and the results were gratifying in
                    all respects to the Festival Association and the city as a whole. Margaret Reid, in her first
                    appearance before a home audience since her study abroad, received an especially warm welcome and
                    pleased her friends with the excellence of her singing. Great appreciation was shown for the music
                    performed, and the large audiences indicated the public spirit behind the project. Representative
                    people made up both the chorus and the audiences, thus indicating a universal love of music which
                    was not restricted to a select group. A rule was made and strictly followed, to close the entrances
                    and exits at eight o'clock, admitting no one during a number. This aided the success of the
                    festival and contributed to the education of other <placeName>

                            influences will rally! The city, the State, take a higher stand for this music festival.
                            Their added self-respect and pride are the sincerest thanks that they can give to the ladies
                            and gentlemen, the leader and the humblest worker who have done this thing. The fullest meed
                            of praise is theirs, and with the coming of another year a widening circle of generous

            <p>In October the chorus committee of the Festival Association met to reorganize the chorus for the next
                    May festival. The enthusiasm exhibited was a favorable indication of a good season to follow.<hi rend="sup">149</hi> Successful festivals were held almost every year from 1889 to 1898, but the
                    last one was a dismal failure. Efforts to revive them in 1899 and 1900 failed, and although
                    so-called May festivals have been held since, there has been no repetition of the grand affairs of
                    the 1880's and 1890's. In 1893 Seidl and Locke broke their contract after the
                    Association refused to meet their sudden demand for a three thousand dollar increase and for a
                    day's postponement of the opening. A consolation concert was given for the benefit of the

                    her as a fine artist. A month later another concert was scheduled, but it failed because of poor
                    advertising. Taking it as a personal affront, the pianist was so affected that she experienced a
                    breakdown. From City Hospital she was later removed to a mental institution. Friends stated that she
                    had always been regarded as eccentric and that her nervous and excitable temperament was unable to

            <p>This decade might be called the age of opera, since far more opera was performed than any other type
                    of music. Most popular were the light operas, especially Gilbert and Sullivan, whose works found

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This was particularly true of <hi rend="i">The Mikado</hi> which was produced more
                    often than all the others. There was a Mikado craze; all sorts of merchandise—even
                    wallpaper—were named ofter the operetta.<hi rend="sup">162</hi>
                    <hi rend="i">The Mikado</hi> was first produced in <placeName>

                    the Grau Company to a delighted audience; the next year it was given no less than four times in the
                    city, each time well received. In addition <hi rend="i">H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of
                    Penzance</hi> were given in 1880; the latter again in 1882; and <hi rend="i">Iolanthe</hi> and <hi rend="i">Patience</hi> in 1883.<hi rend="sup">163</hi> Other light operas were given at
                    intervals by traveling companies, while still others were produced by local groups.</p>
            <p>Grand opera was also frequently performed. At least thirty appearances were noted during the decade,
                    and this by no means represented all. None was noted in 1884 and few in 1885. During this interval
                    there seems to have been little activity on the part of the local opera company. In May, 1885, it
                    was announced that the opera would close its regular season and open a summer season at popular
                    prices, ten cents and twenty cents—admittedly an experiment.<hi rend="sup">164</hi> The
                    business recession was taking its toll of the musical world.</p>
            <p>Traveling companies presented practically the entire gamut of works familiar to present-day
                    audiences, with two or more performances each of <hi rend="i">Il Trovatore, The Bohemian Girl</hi>,
                    and <hi rend="i">Fra Diavolo.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">165</hi> In 1889 a change in technique was
                    observed. The American Opera Company appearing at English's Opera House was not conducted
                    on the "star" system, but roles were assumed by artists of equal merit.<hi rend="sup">166</hi>

                    presented some difficulty in arrangement of salaries, dressing rooms, and minor details of
                    production and direction.</p>
            <p>The opera then as now was fashionable. All the "best" people attended, all dressed
                    in their best. Probably many more women attended than men, particularly at matinee performances.
                    Although well patronized in the seventies, opera grew steadily from its amateur status. Local
                    productions of high quality and of ambitious proportions indicated the extent and development of
                    musical talent in the city. Still no music school or conservatory existed to act as feeder to these
                    amateur productions, for the first conservatory was founded late in 1889 by Clarence Forsythe.<hi rend="sup">167</hi> The training came from private instruction together with the experience
                    gained from singing with the choral societies. No attempts were made to organize an opera company
                    after the 1880's, and only many years later was it possible to establish a symphony
                    orchestra. Musically speaking, 1880–1890 was the golden decade for the Inland City.</p>

            <p>There are distinct problems in giving a fully satisfactory judgment of this ninth volume in a series
                    of eleven by Professor Gipson. It will be far easier to assess its success when, in his future
                    volumes, the author deals with the question of the estrangement of Great Britain and her North
                    American colonies. Here, Professor Gipson has purposely omitted any detailed discussion of the
                    relations between Great Britain and her older American continental colonies in these years from 1763
                    to 1766. His avowed object is to present a careful analysis of developments within the territorial
                    acquisitions gained by Great Britain as a result of the Great War for Empire, and to reserve
                    consideration of the background of the Revolutionary War for a future volume. Thus the Stamp Act and
                    the subsequent American discontent are not treated in this work. In reaction to the many historians
                    who have insisted on considering this period as merely a background to the Revolutionary War,
                    Professor Gipson contents himself with a detailed treatment of the methods used by Great Britain to
                    cope with her new territorial acquisitions.</p>
            <p>After rapidly surveying the framework of the Empire and the domestic political scene, Professor
                    Gipson discusses, in turn, the different areas of concern to Great Britain in these years. The
                    second chapter of the book, on the domestic political scene, is the one section which would have
                    benefited from a more detailed treatment. Space could, perhaps, have been obtained by a more
                    rigorous pruning of the fourth chapter, on the Cherokee War of 1759–1761, which follows
                    the brief chapter summarizing the evolution of the Proclamation of 1763. After a discussion of the
                    Indian uprising of 1763, Professor Gipson proceeds to the most valuable part of the
                    book—a detailed consideration of developments in the widely scattered, and recently
                    obtained, territorial possessions of Great Britain. He presents, in turn, an invaluable <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-053-3-070"/> discussion of political and constitutional developments in

            <p>There can be no doubt of Professor Gipson's extensive knowledge of this period. In this, as
                    in his earlier volumes, he demonstrates repeatedly his vast knowledge of both the primary and the
                    secondary sources. His careful presentation of the many facets of British policy emphasizes the fact
                    that British imperial history in this period cannot be treated as pointing inevitably towards the
                    Revolutionary War. The work is invaluable in demonstrating the complexity of problems facing the
                    British government and the manner in which it dealt with them. Professor Gipson's sympathy
                    for the British point of view is most refreshing in dealing with this period, which so often leads
                    American historians into writing with a pronounced national bias. He reaches the conclusion that the
                    British record in this period is "far from discreditable," and, in surveying the
                    relations of Great Britain with the new acquisitions, he finds little to indicate the storm brewing
                    in the older colonies.</p>
            <p>The main criticisms that can be levelled at Professor Gipson's work concern its clarity. His
                    subject of political and administrative developments in widely differing areas of the globe
                    naturally presents problems of unity, which Professor Gipson in general overcomes. Yet, at times,
                    the main theme is lost in the complexity of detail. One is left with the impression that the overall
                    effect would have been enhanced, and the author's points made just as effectively, by a
                    reduction in the amount of illustrative detail. This occasional obscurity is aided by the nature of
                    Professor Gipson's style. His love for the long, multi-claused sentence slows the pace of
                    the narrative and decreases its effectiveness.</p>
            <p>Yet, even when these minor criticisms are taken into consideration, there remains no doubt that
                    Professor Gipson is doing an indispensable service in writing his multi-volumed survey of the
                    British Empire before the American Revolution. His incomparable knowledge of the innumerable
                    sources, and his careful standard of accuracy, make these volumes an invaluable reference work on
                    these years. The <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-053-3-071"/> present volume compares favorably with the
                    others of the series, and retains the excellent format, numerous maps, and fine index of the earlier
                    volumes. As he nears the completion of his Herculean task, Professor Gipson can look back with
                    satisfaction on a series of volumes distinguished for their breadth of approach and for their fine
                    scholarship. His readers can look forward with pleasure to his final volumes.</p>

            <p>Baurmeister's ninety-four letters and journals, dated from September 2, 1776, to April 23,
                    1784, provide an uninterrupted narrative of the American Revolution.</p>
            <p>Baurmeister, a shrewd observer and a professional soldier, reported to his superior, the Minister of
                    State of Hesse-Cassel, on the military and naval, social and economic aspects of the War for
                    American Independence. He was attached to Hessian headquarters and for a while to the British
                    general staff. Baurmeister was therefore in a position to report, without prejudice, most of the
                    important events of this war because he had no "patriotic ties to either side."
                    His military observations are interesting and usually reliable. He omitted none of the important
                    battles; therefore, he was able to report firsthand on the battles of <placeName>

                    impartial, but they add a quality of freshness to the issues of the time.</p>
            <p>When Lord Cornwallis carried the fight to the South in 1780, Baurmeister continued to keep his
                    superior in Europe informed of the outcome of each battle. Since much of his information was
                    received from deserters and refugees, Baurmeister's reports are not so authoritative. For
                    example, he often wrote "it is possible" (p. 413); it is
                    "claimed" (p. <pb n="312" id="VAA4025-053-3-072"/> 419); and it is
                    "rumored" (p. 547). Yet the reports are surprisingly accurate.</p>
            <p>More than one-third of the book is devoted to the maneuverings of the British, French, Spanish, and
                    Dutch fleets. Baurmeister was quite impressed with the might of the British fleet and the action of
                    the French fleet at Yorktown.</p>
            <p>Disease and epidemics brought death to thousands of European soldiers and incapacitated thousands of
                    others for indefinite periods. Baurmeister wrote:</p>
            <p>"Unfortunately … this pernicious fever will not let up. More become ill each day,
                    and the number of those recovering is small" (p. 306).</p>
            <p>"The stormy and damp, misty weather [in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>], has sent many to bed with breast fever" (p. 420).</p>
            <p>"Bilious fever and ague are very common; the hospitals are filling up, and great numbers are
                    dying" (p. 470).</p>
            <p>Desertions were large on both sides. On this subject Baurmeister reported:</p>
            <p>"On the 11th [October, 1777] we learned from deserters that General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was again approaching with his army to attack us" (p. 123).</p>
            <p>"There was no pillaging and plundering on the part of the Hessians, but it is my duty to
                    report to your Lordship that we had many deserters" (p. 185).</p>
            <p>The evacuation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the reason for these desertions from the Hessian ranks. They liked <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and many refused to leave it.</p>
            <p>Baurmeister, as a rule, spoke well of George Washington:</p>
            <p>"General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in camp at Valley Forge, received these courageous <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> women in the most cordial manner, kept them to dinner, and for the rest of the day they
                    were entertained by the General's wife. Through this lady's kindly intercession,
                    all Quakers were released [from prison] … . everyone is captivated by the
                    general" (pp. 167–168).</p>
            <p>Baurmeister, however, held Congress in contempt:</p>
            <p>"Congress is quite severe, but it has no power, except paper money" (p. 140).</p>
            <p>"Intercepted letters from Colonel Hamilton, General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first adjutant, prophesy that all American enterprises will come to a bad
                    end as long as Congress makes <pb n="313" id="VAA4025-053-3-073"/> the decisions, for they are
                    always too late and never right" (p. 393).</p>
            <p>Professor Uhlendorf has given to the reading public an excellent translation of
                    Baurmeister's confidential letters and journals. This work is also well annotated. This
                    publication is a real contribution to the history of the American Revolution.</p>

                    to the reader; but, unlike many others, there is not a bad article in this group.</p>
            <p>James R. Caldwell, Jr. deals with the religious life of backcountry <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> in the eighteenth century and delineates nicely the devoted and aggressive tactics of
                    the Baptists and Methodists so that they contrast sharply with the relatively unorganized, sporadic,
                    and ineffective efforts of the Anglicans.</p>
            <p>The essay on the <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> Whigs, 1765–1775, by Charles G. Sellers, Jr., emphasizes that the Revolution
                    was the culminating episode in a long campaign of the Carolinians to manage their own affairs and
                    that in the decade under consideration the drift toward revolution was impelled mainly by local
                    events. He concludes that the "most striking feature of the whole story is the stark
                    incongruity … between the Whigs' devotion to `liberty' and their
                    coercive tactics" (p. 46).</p>
            <p>The story of William Blount in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> politics from 1781 to 1789, as related by Alice B. Keith, is marred by some bad writing
                    and interesting editorial slips, e.g., "baited breath" (p. 58). One might also
                    question whether the "variety of his work may be taken as an indication of <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-053-3-074"/> the breadth of his ability" (p. 48), or whether Blount really
                    was a "strong blend of the statesman and the provincial" (p. 49). In the main, the
                    author is a bit too kind to Blount.</p>
            <p>Carolyn Wallace's study of David L. Swain, first Whig governor of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName>, shows clearly that the Carolina Whigs—not the Democrats—were the
                    party of change. Swain, a westerner elected governor by an eastern-controlled Assembly, generally
                    avoided national issues and neither Jackson nor Jacksonian democracy had any appeal to him. He did
                    much to vitalize the executive office, worked for a constitutional convention, served as a delegate,
                    and then moved on to the presidency of the state university.</p>
            <p>The article on Confederate literature and its publishers is primarily a useful cataloging of that
                    activity. Lawrence F. London concludes that while "certainly not of the best quality, the
                    total amount of publishing accomplished in the face of shortages of every kind and under the stress
                    of war is a tribute to the ingenuity and industry of the people of the South" (p. 96).</p>
            <p>Cornelius O. Cathey reveals that <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> generally responded favorably to appeals during the Civil War to replace cotton and
                    tobacco with provision crops, but faulty distribution led to shortages in some areas.</p>
            <p>The editor's contribution on business leaders in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> from 1865 to 1900 should help to puncture the legend that northern men and capital were
                    primarily responsible for the post-war industrialization of the South. Most of the business leaders
                    were North Carolinians, and a number of them had been engaged in industrial activity before 1860.
                    Also, contrary to popular belief, Sitterson found that only 4.2 per cent of these business leaders
                    were in the "rags to riches" group; most were from the middle class and were not
                    self-made men.</p>
            <p>"The superficial issue was the method and form of federal relief; the fundamental issue,
                    however, involved the larger question of the limits of federal activity in the economic
                    field" (p. 126)—so says Arthur Link in his discussion of the cotton crisis, the
                    South, and Anglo-American diplomacy. Wilson and his followers opposed direct federal support of the
                    cotton market or the regulation of acreage, while the southern agrarians in 1914 were among the
                    prime exponents of a program of comprehensive federal aid to <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-053-3-075"/>
                    agriculture and labor. Federal action was a total failure. The British blockade threatened to
                    destroy the "self-recovering" market, but heavy British purchases kept the price
                    up. The crisis passed in the autumn of 1915, and with it went large scale organized anti-British
                    sentiment in the South.</p>
            <p>In his analysis of Hoke Smith and the New Freedom, 1913–1917, Dewey Grantham shows that
                    Smith's progressivism was limited to measures that were primarily of benefit to the South,
                    and that he "could scarcely conceive of the government as an active force in an urbanized
                    and industrialized America." Grantham thinks that Smith was a political opportunist whose
                    vanity and innate rebelliousness undermined his good judgment.</p>
            <p>The study of Eugene Talmadge and the New Deal by Sarah McCulloch Lemmon contains <hi rend="i">ex
                        cathedra</hi> judgments on the New Deal, but it does reveal Talmadge's
                    "duplicity" in using federal funds to balance the state budget. When his request
                    for more funds was turned down, Talmadge increased his opposition to the New Deal program and soon
                    broke entirely with <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Perhaps, Gene's demagoguery could have been pointed up a bit more.</p>
            <p>As a whole this is a good volume and as such it is an appropriate tribute to Albert Ray Newsome by
                    his former students.</p>

            <p>This would be a slender volume indeed if its author had confined himself strictly to discussing
                    Woodrow Wilson and the balance of power. But Professor Buehrig has compensated for a scarcity of
                    materials bearing directly on his topic by employing freely his talent for analysis and by venturing
                    at times into peripheral matters. The result is a provocative book that will be of interest to all
                    scholars in the field of American diplomatic history.</p>
            <p>This book to a large extent deals with American foreign policy in relation to World War I during the
                    period when the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was a neutral. It describes the evolution of <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-053-3-076"/>
                    Wilson's policy from a rigid defense of neutral rights to his attempts at mediation and an
                    advocacy of a league of nations as a means to bring about a negotiated peace. Most of this is a
                    story well known to historians. But by making the most of his evidence the author has shown that
                    Wilson during the latter stages of American neutrality eventually developed an appreciation of the
                    balance of power. This is an interpretation that a few scholars have advanced in sketchy and
                    tentative form, but no one heretofore has attempted to deal with the problem as exhaustively as
                    Professor Buehrig. In fact, he goes so far as to say that "concealed in the January 22,
                    1917 address to the Senate—indeed underlying Wilson's whole policy of peace
                    without victory—was an appreciation of the balance of power point of view: namely, that
                    stability is to be found in an equilibrium of forces no less than in moral excellence" (p.
                    274). To substantiate this claim the author has to interpret the statement "There must not
                    be a balance of power, but a community of power" as an inadequate expression of what was in
                    the back of Wilson's mind. As proof of his contention Professor Buehrig points out that in
                    his "peace without victory" speech Wilson implied there should exist among major
                    antagonists a material rather than a legal equality.</p>
            <p>The chapter "The Submarine in German Policy" contains a strikingly lucid
                    description of why the German high command decided to stake so much on unrestricted submarine
                    warfare, and how Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg was persuaded that even intervention by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would not be sufficient to save <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> from the effects of a ruthless employment of the submarine by <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. Professor Buehrig seriously doubts whether unrestricted submarine warfare could have
                    been averted. He believes: "Only if the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by drastic pressure on the British blockade, could have started a substantial flow of
                    trade with <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, would the German military and naval authorities have been disposed to neglect the
                    opportunities which they believed the submarine afforded" (p. 83).</p>
            <p>The author has little patience with those who argue that the munitions manufacturers were a cause of
                    American involvement in World War I. And he sees no evidence to suggest that <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>'s resentment was a controlling factor in her action since "an absence
                    of munitions in the American <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-053-3-077"/> trade with the Allies could hardly
                    have altered the chain of circumstances," especially when the submarine was aimed at the
                    whole British economy. He takes more seriously the charge that loans to the Allies contributed to
                    the entry of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> into war but counters with the argument that "the final crystallization of the
                    American policy of neutrality in the first four months of 1916 cannot reasonably be attributed to
                    anxiety over the safety of Allied loans, which had begun to be sizable only in the autumn of
                    1915" (p. 95). Another example of the excellent analytical quality of Professor
                    Buehrig's writing is his demonstration that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> could not detect bias for the Allies in its policy because economic and political
                    factors reinforced each other and could only have been separated by <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>'s confining her unannounced submarine attacks to armed enemy merchantmen.</p>
            <p>In the chapter "Defense of Principle" the difficulties of Wilson, Bryan, and
                    Lansing in arriving at a sound foreign policy are ascribed in a large measure to their living in a
                    nation unaccustomed to dealing with the problems of security. These men are depicted as too prone to
                    "judge America's political connection with the rest of the world in terms of
                    legal, moral, and philosophical ideas, universal in application" (p. 150). In the
                    author's judgment, Wilson displayed a weakness when he based his policy on sentiment and
                    represented "German autocracy as the cause for America's embroilment and democracy
                    as the guarantee of American security" (p. 150). But this analysis does not take into
                    consideration the dynamic quality of Wilson's belief in the mission of America which

                    </placeName> should stand before the world as a champion of liberty and democratic ideals. It was
                    his devotion to the mission of America that put driving power into Wilson's policy and in
                    time gave vitality to his growing appreciation of the balance of power. The Wilson of 1916 who began
                    to define nationalism "in terms of democratic ideals, and identification of those ideals
                    with the universal interests of mankind" (p. 247) becomes more comprehensible when it is
                    recalled that this was the same man who at <placeName>

                    mankind."</p>
            <p>Despite the use of a considerable body of manuscript and secondary materials there are certain gaps
                    in Professor Buehrig's research. A notable omission is the absence <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-053-3-078"/> of any reference to Harley Notter's important book, <hi rend="i">The Origins of the Foreign Policy of Woodrow Wilson.</hi> Also there is no discussion
                    of the sinking of the "Laconia" which as Samuel S. Spencer, Jr. in his <hi rend="i">Decision for War</hi> has demonstrated, had considerable influence on both
                    Wilson's and the American people's thinking during the crisis of February and
                    March, 1917. But these deficiencies do not keep the book from being a significant and interesting
                    contribution.</p>

            <p>Professor Stover, associate professor of history at Purdue University, has produced a study of
                    interest not only to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> group of railroad historians but to economic and general historians as well. The
                    central theme of his study is suggested by the subtitle, <hi rend="i">A Study in Finance and
                        Control.</hi> He traces the shift of the railroads of the South (defined here as the eight
                    Confederate states east of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>) from being financed, managed, controlled, and owned chiefly by southerners in the
                    pre-Civil War period to the dominance of northern finance and control by 1900. In so doing, he also
                    gives an excellent sketch of construction of the southern network and of the combination and merger
                    movement of the period, 1865–1900.</p>
            <p>The introductory chapters present the background to 1865. The impact of the Civil War is described in
                    terms of attempts to fill gaps in the network, problems of equipment and maintenance, deterioration
                    in service, and military destruction. In 1865, although "the Southern railroads were in
                    ruins," the wrecks belonged to southern individuals, cities, and states. The extent to
                    which borrowed money or funded debt had been raised abroad or in the North and the extent of state
                    and local aid and assistance are portrayed in completing the background picture.</p>
            <p>The thirty-five year period, 1865–1900, is divided into four sub-periods. The first
                    period, 1865–1873, was marked by the physical rehabilitation of the roads, their
                    equipment and <pb n="319" id="VAA4025-053-3-079"/> service, and a slow rate of new construction. The
                    period was also marked by the activities of numerous carpetbaggers either taking over old lines or
                    projecting new ones. Carpetbag railroad activity was most evident in those states where construction
                    was chiefly concentrated (the two <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Carolinas</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>), but Professor Stover concludes that "there was no significant connection
                    between the presence of extraordinarily active carpetbaggers in these states and their relatively
                    rapid railroad construction. In all four of these states, with the possible exception of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, the railroads were built in spite of the carpetbagger rather than because of
                    him" (p.62.) This era resulted in few permanent railroad acquisitions by northerners or
                    their southern associates. With the return of political home rule, the carpetbag group lost control.
                    The results of the era, however, aggravated the effects of the depression following the Panic of
                    1873.</p>
            <p>The second period, 1874–1880, is described under the heading, "A Story of
                    Receivership." As a result of an increased proportion of funded debt in their capital
                    structure, less gross earnings per mile, and an average operating ratio slightly higher than the
                    national average, in addition to the aftermath of the war and reconstruction periods, the railroads
                    of the South suffered correspondingly more in the Panic of 1873 than did the northern roads.
                    Consequently, the lag in new railroad construction was especially severe in the South. "Too
                    frequently in the early 1870's northern management of southern railroads was associated
                    with uneconomical construction, unwise financing, or even outright fraud" (p. 133).</p>
            <p>The 1880's are characterized as a period of "Prosperity, Expansion, and
                    Consolidation." There were few receiverships or foreclosure sales in the South, although
                    dividends there lagged well behind the national average. Construction was slightly more rapid than
                    for the nation. Of the fifty-eight southern railroads, the three largest in 1890 (the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>

                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>), operated about ten thousand miles, over a third of the total southern mileage. This
                    extensive consolidation confirmed the shift from southern to northern financial influence and
                    control.</p>
            <p>The 1890's were "in many ways a combination of the two preceding decades."
                    The South again had a rate of new <pb n="320" id="VAA4025-053-3-080"/> rail construction slightly
                    more rapid than the national average and by 1900 had "rounded out the basic outline of its
                    ultimate railroad system." "In both reorganization and consolidation the end of
                    the century found northern money and management triumphant" (p. 274). One of the
                    interesting features of this study is the description of the variety of methods, "including
                    outright purchase, large scale new construction, and long term leases" by which working
                    financial control was achieved.</p>
            <p>Eight maps, well documented footnotes, and a good bibliography add to the value of this book. This
                    reviewer hopes that Professor Stover will utilize his knowledge in further studies of railroading in
                    relation to general economic development in the southern region.</p>

            <p>In the vernacular of today John Franklin Jameson might be called "Mr. History," not
                    because he wrote notable histories of many volumes, nor because he edited vast collections of source
                    materials, but because he played a part, usually an important part in almost every undertaking of
                    the historical profession. He was among a small group of historians who managed the American
                    Historical Association, manned its committees, and arranged its programs. From 1895 when he became
                    the first editor of the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi> until his death in 1939,
                    Jameson was one of the foremost leaders in the founding of historical agencies, the development of
                    research facilities in history, and the collection and publication of historical sources. He was
                    most significant in helping the new scientific historians become established, adopt high standards,
                    and grow to their present number and professional status. Other historians excelled in many things,
                    but it is doubtful that any equalled him in the service he rendered to the historical profession.</p>
            <p>Because he was unable to go to Europe for his graduate training, he received the first Ph.D. in
                    history from Johns <pb n="321" id="VAA4025-053-3-081"/> Hopkins University in 1882, and remained a
                    member of its teaching staff for six additional years. While connected with Johns Hopkins he made
                    friends of an important group of future leaders of the historical profession including Charles H.
                    Haskins, Woodrow Wilson, and Frederick J. Turner. He also published <hi rend="i">Introduction to the
                        Study of Constitutional and Political History of the States</hi> (1886), and "Willem
                    Usselinx" (1887).</p>
            <p>For thirteen years (1888–1901), Jameson taught at Brown University and, while so engaged,
                    was chosen chairman of the Historical Manuscripts Commission of the American Historical Association
                    as well as editor of the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review.</hi> He also published Essays in
                    Constitutional History (1889), <hi rend="i">The History of Historical Writing in America</hi>
                    (1891), the "Letters" of Phineas Bond (1896), the "Letters" of
                    Stephenson Higginson (1896), a "Guide to the Items Relating to American History in the
                    Reports of the English Manuscripts Commission" (1898), and the <hi rend="i">Correspondence
                        of John C. Calhoun</hi> (1899).</p>
            <p>He was persuaded to accept the chairmanship of the department of history of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1901, a position in which he was not completely contented. Consequently four years
                    later, when Andrew C. McLaughlin decided to return to teaching, Jameson took his place as head of
                    the Bureau of Historical Research of the Carnegie Institution of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and again became the editor of the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review,</hi> a
                    position from which he had resigned upon going to the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He remained head of the Bureau and editor of the Review until 1928. During these years
                    many important historical projects were completed and others advanced towards fulfillment.</p>
            <p>Among the significant publishing activities of this period with which Jameson was associated in one
                    way or another were <hi rend="i">The Original Narratives of Early American History</hi> (19 vols.,
                    1906–1917), of which Jameson edited two volumes and served as general editor of the
                    series; the series of <hi rend="i">Guides to the Material for American History</hi> in foreign
                    archives; <hi rend="i">Writings on American History</hi> (1904- ); and the <hi rend="i">Correspondence of Andrew Jackson</hi> (7 vols., 1926–1935), of which Jameson was
                    joint editor with John Spencer Bassett.</p>
            <p>A final period in Jameson's career occurred after the Carnegie Institution decided to retire
                    Jameson in 1929 when he reached seventy years of age and to reduce its expenditures <pb n="322" id="VAA4025-053-3-082"/> in support of history. He received, however, an offer of the chief
                    clerkship in the Manuscripts Division of the Library of Congress which he accepted in 1928. For nine
                    years he continued his historical activities, often utilizing the expert workmanship of various
                    members of the profession, his own experienced supervision, and funds from private persons, the
                    American Council of Learned Societies, or from government sources. <hi rend="i">The Dictionary of

                    Jameson's leadership. Probably his greatest contribution was his tireless labor in support
                    of the National Archives, which fortunately was rewarded with success before his death.</p>
            <p>This volume is in a sense a memorial in recognition of his service. In addition to an excellent
                    introduction prepared by Elizabeth Donnan, it contains selected letters of Jameson arranged
                    chronologically and in periods of his career. They are amply documented and indexed. Often they
                    reveal bits of information about individuals with whom Jameson worked. Sometimes the notes contain
                    short quotations from letters which Jameson was answering. The workmanship embodied in this volume
                    seems as nearly perfect as one could wish. Two features may be queried; the lack of a bibliography
                    of Jameson's publications and the awkward and forbidding size of the work. The importance
                    of Jameson's publications and his relations with many other publications would easily have
                    justified the labor of compiling a bibliography. Nevertheless, the American Philosophical Society
                    has sponsored a worthy volume. The editors who did not live to see their work published will be
                    pleasantly recalled because of the labor they expended on this work.</p>

            <p>This is another volume in the American Procession Series—a series of "Dramatic
                    non-fiction books which center around epic episodes of our history and cultural growth that have not
                        <pb n="323" id="VAA4025-053-3-083"/> been adequately told—crucial developments that
                    set the direction of our civilization." Here the story is concerned with agrarian
                    discontent as reflected in the Granger, Farmers Alliance, Populist, Nonpartisan League, and Farmers
                    Union movements. Dale Kramer is particularly well equipped by training and experience to tell this
                    story in that he has had firsthand contact with participants in these revolts, has edited two farm
                    newspapers, and at one time served as national secretary of the Farm Holiday Association.</p>
            <p>The Populist Convention of 1892 provides the stage for the opening of the story. Excitement on that
                    occasion reached a high pitch as farmers, some of whom had been exhorted "to raise less
                    corn and more hell," joined joyously in song and crusade against the evils that beset them.
                    The proceedings of the convention were participated in with all the fervor that usually accompanies
                    an old-time religious revival.</p>
            <p>From the high drama of Populist revolt Kramer turns to trace the origin, development, and demise of
                    the other farm movements from the Grangers to the Farmers Union. "Emphasis has been
                    laid," he states, "on the stirring rise of the crusades and the accomplishments of
                    the agrarian movements; the melancholy bickerings of disintegration have mostly been
                    omitted." The economic and social conditions out of which these revolts sprang are seen to
                    vary only slightly. The farmers' problems seemed to defy solution; and each revolt failed
                    to attain its immediate objectives. In each instance, the author gives less attention to the causes
                    of discontent and the accomplishments of the revolt than he does to drawing vivid pen portraits of
                    the leaders. The reader will detect a Hollywood-like style in the buildup of such leaders as Mary
                    Ellen Lease, Ignatius Donnelly, "Sockless Jerry" Simpson, Tom Watson,
                    "Pitchfork Ben" Tillman, Arthur C. Townley, and Milo Reno. The conservative press,
                    usually identified by the author as the "gold-bug" newspapers, dubbed these
                    leaders "wild jackasses."</p>
            <p>The general reader will find this book to be exciting in most parts, but will not acquire a very good
                    understanding of the conditions which spawned these recurring revolts, or of the results obtained.
                    The emphasis is centered on presenting in dramatic fashion the personalities involved in these
                    movements. This is very well done, for generally they were colorful and vociferous characters.</p>
            <pb n="324" id="VAA4025-053-3-084"/>
            <p>The more serious reader—particularly the historian—will regret that the author
                    did not use footnotes or include in the bibliography a listing of all the sources used in this
                    important study. The effectiveness of the narrative is impaired, too, by the inclusion of numerous
                    long (for example pp. 38–45) quotations. There is considerable evidence, also, that the
                    book was not proofread carefully.</p>
            <p>The author has a definite flair for dramatic storytelling and he has produced a readable study. It is
                    gratifying to note how many of the reforms proposed in these periods of agrarian revolt have later
                    come to be parts of our way of life. After reading this volume one will agree with the author that
                    "the hoofprints of the wild jackasses are on our democracy, and its configuration is the
                    better for them."</p>

               <hi rend="i">History of St. Meinrad Archabbey.</hi> By Albert Kleber, O.S.B. (St. Meinrad,
                    Indiana: Grail Publications, 1954. Pp. v, 540. Illustrations and index. $7.50.)</head>
            <p>In the Middle Ages in Western Europe Benedictine monks performed a valuable service for posterity by
                    chronicling the histories of their establishments. Because of their labors, later historians were
                    enabled to know much about the times that might otherwise have been lost. Now Father Albert Kleber
                    follows in the venerable footsteps of many a son of St. Benedict in giving us a book about
                    Indiana's Archabbey of St. Meinrad. It is not—let it be recorded—a
                    work in the modern tradition of history writing. Father Kleber, like his scholarly predecessors,
                    sees history as the working out on this earth of God's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName>. But while the secular reader may not place the same interpretation on events as the
                    Benedictine priest, he can, nevertheless, profit by studying about them. Father
                    Kleber—again like the medieval annalist—has gone far beyond the cloistered
                    walls of St. Meinrad. This book deals with early Indiana history, with the Catholic Indian missions,
                    and with the foundation of various other Benedictine abbeys and educational institutions, as well as
                    happenings within the monastery itself.</p>
            <p>It was in February of 1853 that two priests from Einsiedeln in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> arrived in Southern Indiana to found <pb n="325" id="VAA4025-053-3-085"/> a mission
                    among the European Catholic settlers, mostly German, in that area. The first years of St. Meinrad
                    were filled with difficulties, privation, and suffering. The monks were beset with malaria and
                    cholera attacks. In their first home, a wooden shack, they were much oppressed by the summer heat,
                    the more so since they had come from a land of more temperate climate than Indiana. With no screens
                    on the windows, they were forced to choose between the heat and the mosquitoes. Financial troubles
                    were endemic, and at one point the mother monastery seriously considered closing the mission. But
                    the spirit of St. Benedict prevailed, and by the end of the Civil War the monastery was on firm
                    footing. In 1871 St. Meinrad attained its independence of Einsiedeln and became an abbey.</p>
            <p>The first abbot, Martin Marty, showed great interest in Indian missions, especially among the Sioux.
                    Father Kleber has recorded the labors of the priests of St. Meinrad in the area of the Dakotas, and
                    he shows how Abbot Martin was instrumental in persuading Sitting Bull in 1881 to return from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> after that Indian chief's self exile. At the same time, St. Meinrad furnished
                    priests and built churches for many communities in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and Southern Indiana, the most northerly being as far away as <placeName>

                    </placeName>. From the beginning there was a college for the training of young men for the
                    priesthood, both secular and regular. There is an interesting account of life in <placeName>

                    </placeName> refused for ten years to visit it for Confirmation.</p>
            <p>In October of 1953 St. Meinrad became an archabbey. It was completely self-sufficient, both
                    economically and as an educational institution. It had daughter abbeys throughout the Middle West.
                    There was a fine press which had already turned out a respectable list of publications. Above all,
                    for the lay historian, the archabbey had participated in and had helped promote the growth of the
                    state of Indiana. The priests and brothers of St. Meinrad could indeed look back on a remarkable
                    century of development.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A History of American Magazines.</hi> Volume IV, <hi rend="i">1885–1905.</hi> By Frank Luther Mott. (<placeName>

                    </placeName> University Press, 1957. Pp. xvii, 858. Illustrations and index. $12.50.)</head>
            <p>In his brief preface Professor Mott emphasizes that he has merely attempted to discuss "the
                    more important periodicals in the various categories" for the two decades,
                    1885–1905. Early chapters offer an overall view of American magazines in this period,
                    along with chapters on circulation and advertising, editors and contributors, monthlies, weeklies,
                    quarterlies, as well as local and regional magazines.</p>
            <p>There are more than a dozen chapters about magazines ranging from those related to the graphic arts,
                    politics and economics, foreign affairs, education, religion and philosophy, to others concerning
                    agriculture, science and medicine, sports and recreation, activities of women, thence to humor and
                    hobbies. About four hundred well-packed pages complete this portion of the volume, a portion longer
                    than numerous published books.</p>
            <p>But Professor Mott is only half finished when these chapters are concluded. The remaining
                    thirty-four—the "Supplement"—include separate sketches of an
                    equal number of important magazines which flourished, 1885–1905. Then, for good measure,
                    there is a sixty-eight page index and dozens of interesting pictures on unnumbered pages.</p>
            <p>This comprehensive and invaluable history is written by one who can see and describe both the forest
                    and the individual trees therein. Moreover, the general development of magazines is woven into basic
                    movements and attitudes of American history. He portrays an understanding of the general impact of
                    technology, urbanization, rural free delivery, lower postage rates, industrialization and mounting
                    wealth, world trade and imperialism, expanding public education, the growth of advertising, the
                    passing of "personal" journalism, the progress of the West and the South, the
                    changing status of women, increased leisure, and other changes on magazines and American life
                    generally.</p>
            <p>Possibly magazines reached the peak of their influence during the twenty years, 1885–1905.
                    The mobility of American life which came with the automobile had not yet arrived and competition
                    with television, radio, and films was in the future. Moreover, though university extension and adult
                    education <pb n="327" id="VAA4025-053-3-087"/> "movements" had been born, their
                    mushrooming, as well as that of the trade associations, was also principally in the future. Even the
                    paperbacks, at least as they are now known, were no threat. The newspapers, especially the Sunday
                    editions, were the principal rival of the magazines. In fact, the actual difference between some
                    Sunday newspapers and some magazines was about equal to that almost imperceptible difference between
                    contemporary versions of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Democracy and Harrison Republicanism!</p>
            <p>Professor Mott writes with wit and humor. Whether the quotation from Herbert B. Adams terming infant
                    university extension " `the Salvation Army of education' " (p. 263)
                    represents perception, wit, or bias is one on which this reviewer prefers to plead the Fifth
                    Amendment. There is a wholesome-ness about the manner in which Mott tells his story, acting like a
                    good umpire who calls things as he sees them without waiting for the echo from the crowd.
                    Incidentally, there may be much significance in the concluding part of the opening paragraph which
                    states that "there was no time in those twenty years [1885–1905] when the cry of
                    protest was not almost as loud as the shout of success."</p>
            <p>In a work on such a grand scale there are sins of omission and commission, and a few other kinds as
                    well. The use of numerous quotations without traceable citations is unfortunate and disturbing, but
                    there is so much useful information in this huge volume that it would be distasteful to pull Old
                    Betsy from the mantle and shoot at miscellaneous targets. Presumably budding journalists and young
                    scholars can now win some of their spurs by proving Professor Mott to be fallible, but, if so, they
                    are likely to be much indebted to him and to add a bit to his stature as a historian of American
                    magazines.</p>

            <p>This impressive addition to existing biographical information about American artists makes available
                    to historians, research scholars, and collectors a mine of information <pb n="328" id="VAA4025-053-3-088"/> not hitherto available. As its title makes clear, it includes artists
                    who were active in this country from the first years of colonization to the Civil War.</p>
            <p>The scope of the work is astounding. Between ten and eleven thousand names are included, together
                    with documental biographical information, and the word "artist" is used to
                    designate painters (ranging from sign and panorama painters to portraitists), engravers,
                    lithographers, draftsmen, silhouette-cutters, wax modelers, woodcarvers, cameo-cutters, medalists,
                    and sculptors.</p>
            <p>Many historians who are active in the field of American art have been aware of the slow and laborious
                    work that has gone into the preparation of this book for the past two decades, from the time of its
                    first inception as a project of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Research Survey of the Works Progress Administration, through the period

                    </placeName> Art Project and Historical Records Survey, to the time when it was taken over by the
                    New-York Historical Society. During those years, George C. Groce was the tireless guiding spirit. In
                    the final stages, Charles E. Baker and David H. Wallace shared with Dr. Groce the work of
                    compilation and editing.</p>
            <p>But this does not mean that these three men have done it alone. Numerous people throughout the
                    country, some connected with museums, libraries or historical societies, others free-lance
                    historians, have contributed what they could. The acknowledgements in the foreword fill seven pages,
                    citing individuals and institutions from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In itself, this list of
                    contributors serves as a "who's who" of men and women who have taken a
                    real interest in the roots of American culture—so far as the arts are
                    concerned—not only in ferreting out facts about our early limners and craftsmen, but in
                    their willingness to share their findings with others.</p>
            <p>As one leafs through the book, one recognizes here and there some well-known names, but most of the
                    entries are unfamiliar. Thousands of artists who, with the passing of time, have slipped into
                    obscurity, are now a part of recorded history; and the biographical notes which follow their names
                    have been so carefully screened and documented by the editors that the reader feels no hesitancy in
                    accepting the data as valid.</p>
            <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-053-3-089"/>
            <p>To the body of the work the authors have appended a "Key of Sources" which is in
                    all probability the most complete bibliography of books, journals, and catalogs on American art yet
                    published—a very useful tool in itself.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to say who will find the volume most helpful: research scholars, collectors, or
                    owners of family heirlooms. Obviously, they will all find it of value; and it will be a surprise
                    (and a disappointment) to this reviewer if the book does not soon appear on thousands of
                    bookshelves, private and public, throughout the land.</p>

            <p>Two introductory chapters deal with "The Communities and Storytellers" and
                    "The Art of Negro Storytelling." The first chapter possibly shows an error in
                    emphasis: except for James D. Suggs, the five people who contribute two-thirds of all the stories
                    are given three lines each, whereas some minor contributors have six or seven lines of biography.
                    Furthermore, the rascally William Brown Lee, who enjoys the distinction of having his photograph on
                    the dust-jacket, actually contributed but one tale, whereas James D. Suggs (equally photogenic)
                    supplied fifty-nine (or 35 per cent of the total). Finally, although four of the five most important
                    contributors were born in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Suggs also lived in thirty-eight other states while pursuing a score of different
                    occupations, three of which involved travel—work on a boat, as a minstrel, as a
                    professional ball player. While it is true that the Deep South tended to be the natal region of the
                    most responsive informants, other factors — such as age, ruralism, leisure,
                    travel—were not controlled. John Blackamore, highly praised for the quality of his

                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. Although described as "my second best," Blackamore has only ten
                    stories included.</p>
            <p>Editing by initial selection explains the vitality and appeal of the majority of the stories. As
                    reported in "Bibliography and Notes," frequently many different informants told
                    their particular version of a tale. By choosing the best <hi rend="i">variant</hi> among many, the
                    collector had no temptation to bowdlerize or otherwise to edit away from <hi rend="i">the original
                        purity.</hi> As mentioned in the text, Blackamore dictated for seven or eight hours at a sitting
                    and Suggs supplied a total of nearly two hundred stories; obviously only the best stories from even
                    these master tellers survived the scrutiny of the meticulous editor.</p>
            <p>Lively language includes such samples: the cow "could kick the sweetening out of a
                    gingersnap"; the turkey gobbler "strut walking"; the weather
                    "going to fair up"; the speaker who must "buck prick my ears to get every
                    word"; the man who will "steal his own hat off his hoe to keep in
                    practice."</p>
            <p>A vigorous attack on Joel Chandler Harris (p. 131) has caused the reviewer to examine with extra care
                    the thesis which Professor Dorson states on page 187. Since Harris was not concerned with being a
                    folklore scholar, even though he earned the highest praise from the folklorists of his time, the
                    attack on his animal stories written in dialect is unduly severe. In the pre-tape-recording,
                    pre-grants-for-research days, Harris performed the arduous task of recording with verbal symbols a
                    distinctive type of speech for his time and area. Scholars have long utilized his excellent
                    contribution to original language. (True, to facilitate reading, periodically since his day his
                    stories have been rewritten to minimize or to remove the dialect.)</p>
            <p>Examination of Negro lore from other countries in six comparatively recent published collections
                    (Mary Gould Davis, Harold Courlander, Philip Sherlock) reveals that the preponderant emphasis is on
                    animal tales. Is it not possible that antipathy toward the animal tale as an important type among
                    Negroes inadvertently caused Professor Dorson to discourage the reporting of animal stories?</p>
            <p>On page 187 this interesting thesis is given: "<placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Negro tales form a distinctive repertoire, separate from the narratives of West Africa,
                    the West Indies, Europe, the British Isles, and white America. Southern Negroes <pb n="331" id="VAA4025-053-3-091"/> have drawn upon all these lores, and added materials from their own
                    environment and experience to produce a richly diversified and culturally independent folk
                    tradition."</p>
            <p>This thesis wisely takes cognizance of the commonly held viewpoint that American Indians and American
                    Negroes have interchange of folk materials, especially stories. But it ignores similar interchange
                    of material with other peoples. The monumental research on folk motifs indicates that a
                    comparatively small number of patterns are used in forming the folktales of the world. For instance,
                    the sticky effigy (as found in "The Tar Baby") has been identified in no less than
                    three hundred world tales. The scholarly thoroughness with which Professor Dorson has indicated
                    parallels between his collection and the work of other researchers would, it seems to this reviewer,
                    discourage him from describing localization of borrowings (by means of small changes in place,
                    character, custom, language) as "culturally independent folk tradition."</p>

                    </placeName>: Indiana University Press, 1957. Pp. xiv, 318. Illustrations, appendix, notes, and
                    index. $6.75.)</head>
            <p>It is fortunate that the late George Sarton, who spent most of his life in the study of ancient and
                    medieval science, should extend the area of study to include the period of the Renaissance. This
                    book is all the more remarkable since it was written by one who in 1929 felt that "from the
                    scientific point of view, the Renaissance was <hi rend="i">not</hi> a renaissance" and who
                    wrote of the Renaissance as a period of "instinctive resistance to any kind of scientific
                    enlightment" (J. W. Thompson, <hi rend="i">et al., The Civilization of the
                    Renaissance,</hi> pp. 75, 93).</p>
            <p>The title of this work, originally delivered as the Patten Lectures at Indiana University in 1955, is
                    derived from the six wings of the seraphim (Isaiah 6:2) and the six wings, or chapters, of the
                    famous astronomical tables compiled by Immanuel Bonfils of Tarascon in the middle of the fourteenth
                    century. The six chapters of Sarton's work are: The Frame of the Renaissance; Exploration
                    and Education; Mathematics and Astronomy; Physics, Chemistry, Technology; <pb n="332" id="VAA4025-053-3-092"/> Natural History; Anatomy and Medicine; Leonardo da Vinci: Art and
                    Science. In this book the word Renaissance, "a kind of weasel," refers to the
                    period 1450 to about 1600; i.e., from the Western discovery of printing to the death of Giordano
                    Bruno.</p>
            <p>Since the whole of science during this century and a half is a subject of tremendous magnitude, the
                    author has endeavored to sketch the contributions of some thirty men of science, with the hope that
                    by knowing these well one could "imagine all the others." His selection, while
                    somewhat artificial, succeeds well in showing the gigantic and revolutionary novelties of
                    Renaissance science. One can "hardly speak of a rebirth; it was a real birth, a new
                    beginning."</p>
            <p>Dr. Sarton always considered himself "a man deeply interested in all the humanities of
                    science, and above all, in the personalities of scientific investigators" (p. vii). This
                    trait is well displayed in the present work. Biographical facts, while necessarily limited, are
                    sufficiently detailed to relate the complex and elusive personalities of the men of science to the
                    exciting and troubled period of the Renaissance. Some thirty authentic portraits by contemporary
                    artists contribute to the delineation of these scientific personalities.</p>
            <p>The international character of the scientific discoveries of the period is clearly demonstrated as
                    well as the relationship of Renaissance science to that of the preceding periods. Also amply brought
                    out is the dualism of the period. The Renaissance was an age of scientific fact and superstition,
                    the rediscovery of classical knowledge and the unveiling of new facts, the use of Latin and the
                    vernacular, the moderns vs. the ancients, astronomy and astrology, chemistry and alchemy, truth and
                    nonsense, correct ideas and fantasies, and the genius and the charlatan. The Renaissance was a
                    golden age of letters and arts, but it was also an age of intolerance and cruelty.</p>
            <p>An appendix on Leonardo Chronology, seventy pages of notes, and an index complete the work. Professor
                    Sarton was prevented by his death on March 22, 1956, from reading the proof and preparing the index.
                    Had he lived the latter undoubtedly would have been more adequate and complete and the few errors in
                    dates corrected: Ficino died in 1499 not 1497 (p. 101); Constantinople fell in 1453 not 1543 (p.
                    107); and the Italian text of Dioscorides was first published <pb n="333" id="VAA4025-053-3-093"/>
                    in 1544 not 1944 (p. 285). One shortcoming, if it may be called so in a survey of this type, is the
                    relatively little attention given to the role of philosophy in the scientific thought of the period.
                    Aristotelianism, Platonism, and Pythagoreanism were all important in the early development of modern
                    science.</p>

                    Butterfield. (<placeName>

            <p>Books about history writers can be of very different kinds. There is, for example, the dry, dreary
                    list of historical authors, with summaries of their work, which is the bane of the graduate student
                    getting ready for his general examinations. At the other end of the scale there can be penetrating
                    and detailed studies of individual historians and the ways their minds work. Professor
                    Butterfield's work belongs to the latter category. It is an extended version of a series of
                    six lectures given at Queen's University, Belfast, in 1954 and later broadcast on the
                    B.B.C.'s Third Program.</p>
            <p>The fact that this could be broadcast over a national radio program—even the Third
                    Program—is a striking commentary on the difference between British and American ideas of
                    what listeners are entitled to hear. It is almost inconceivable that anything like this series of
                    talks—which probably not one person in ten thousand would understand, at least in our
                    country—could be broadcast in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, even over a radio station belonging to a university, to say nothing of a nationwide
                    hook-up.</p>
            <p>Professor Butterfield's book is not for the newcomer to the study of history. The reader
                    must be familiar with the course and some of the main events of European history, and must have read
                    some of the great historians—at least Ranke and Acton, with whom the author deals most
                    extensively. The person thus prepared will find in Professor Butterfield's discussions
                    ample material for reflection, and will probably be so impressed by the keen analyses and criticisms
                    that he will get out his Ranke and Acton again and refresh his acquaintance.</p>
            <p>No single limited theme ties the six lectures together. In general, though the author dips into
                    historiography as far <pb n="334" id="VAA4025-053-3-094"/> back as the sixteenth century, they are
                    concerned with the great century in which the modern historical method was
                    established—between the latter half of the eighteenth century and the latter half of the
                    nineteenth. "It is not at all my object, now," says Professor Butterfield,
                    "to insist that we should make an attempt to bring our useless predecessors back to life; I
                    wish rather to see whether some advantage cannot be achieved—some fertile interaction
                    produced, perhaps — by a more disrespectful treatment of their remains. Their books are
                    to be handled rather in the way that the economic historian might handle the stale records of a
                    defunct business house: so that we may learn whether there is not a history to be wrung out of them
                    totally unlike anything that the writers of them ever had in mind."</p>
            <p>Professor Butterfield's treatment of the past authors is by no means so
                    "disrespectful" as this quotation would indicate. He tries to see, for the most
                    part sympathetically, what various historians had in mind when they approached their tasks; and he
                    is generous in indicating what he thinks they achieved.</p>
            <p>The first lectures, on "The History of Historiography," describe the attempts of
                    eighteenth-century writers to produce a critical and analytical body of general history and to look
                    at historiography itself as an historical phenomenon and the historian as a product and symbol of
                    his time. Professor Butterfield thereupon defines the subject matter and scope of analytical history
                    of historiography and points out the contributions made by the nineteenth century to the development
                    of a scientific method in history writing. Then he discusses the "more general
                    significance" of a study of historiography, and remarks: "The problems of
                    historiography are at certain points closely connected with the problems of life. They touch the
                    question of the way in which human beings are to take their vicissitudes on the earth—the
                    way in which nations are to reflect on their corporate experience …. The framework which
                    people give to the their general history—the notion they have of man in time and the
                    processes of time— may do much to determine the rest their outlook."</p>
            <p>The second chapter deals with "The Rise of the German Historical School" in the
                    eighteenth century; the third with "Lord Acton and the Nineteenth-Century Historical
                    Movement," and the fourth with "Ranke and the Conception of "General
                    History.'" The fifth chapter is a fascinating case-study <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-053-3-095"/> in the vagaries of historians in dealing with a specific problem, and a
                    rather merciless analysis of the way some of them went astray for years by using less instead of
                    more important evidence. It is entitled: "The Reconstruction of an Historical Episode: The
                    history of the enquiry into the origins of the Seven Years War." The sixth and last chapter
                    is another case-study of the vicissitudes in the treatment of a particular historical episode; but
                    this time the discussion deals not only with the episode itself, the Massacre of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName>, and with the ways in which its mysteries have been tackled by various historians and
                    schools of interpretation, but also with what Butterfield considers the failure of Acton, in his
                    writings on the subject, to give adequate weight to evidence contradicting his views.</p>
            <p>Some college teachers may be tempted to use <hi rend="i">Man on His Past</hi> as a sort of <hi rend="i">pons asinorum</hi> for graduate students specializing in European history. If one can
                    understand this book and discuss it intelligently, it may safely be assumed that he has done some
                    reading in the field, and is able to reflect maturely upon what he has read.</p>

            <p>In the welter of writing about World War II there is relatively little in English about its
                    northernmost phases. Professor Lundin's welcome book attempts not to provide a definitive
                    history of these phases, but by making available additional materials to call attention to
                    "certain problems, particularly in the fields of politics and international
                    relations" (p. 7) which previous books in English leave unmentioned or unsettled. He has
                    utilized many memoirs, chiefly in Finnish, Swedish, and German. Of "the writers who
                    enlighten or mislead us" (chap. 2) he finds especially important among Finns Marshal

            <p>As background material the ambitions of Finnish nationalists previous to 1939 are presented. The
                    anti-Soviet Lapua movement threatening to set up a Fascist dictatorship and the Suur-Suomi (Greater <placeName>

                    </placeName>) agitation looking toward the inclusion of Karelians, Estonians, and others under
                    Finnish rule were only outstanding examples of agitation which made <placeName>
                        <country reg="fi">Finland</country>
                    </placeName> seem to the Russian bear a "rather gruff little lamb" (chap. 3). Such
                    movements had, however, subsided by 1939, and Lundin believes that in spite of mistakes made by the
                    Finnish government in its dealings with the U.S.S.R., there was no real threat from <placeName>
                        <country reg="fi">Finland</country>
                    </placeName> which could have justified the Soviet attack.</p>
            <p>In the Winter War (December 1939 to March 1940) <placeName>
                        <country reg="fi">Finland</country>
                    </placeName> fought heroically, but was forced to give up by her shortage of manpower and the

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. The territorial cessions which the U.S.S.R. exacted from the Finns and their fear that
                    they might be brought completely under Soviet control led them to look to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> for help. Even before the German attack on Russia in June 1941, Finnish reservists were
                    mobilized along the Russian frontier, and the Finns, "reluctant or eager" (p.
                    113), became "brothers-in-arms," or rather "stepbrothers-in
                    arms" (p. 145) of the Germans after the attack.</p>
            <p>Memoirs of the Finnish and German leaders show sharp disagreement between the
                    "stepbrothers-in-arms" from the very beginning of the Continuation War
                    (1941–1944), especially as the Finns refused to make the attacks on Leningrad in the
                    south and the Murmansk Railroad in the north which the Germans urged. As the tide of battle
                    gradually turned against <placeName>
                  <country reg="gw">Germany</country>, <country reg="fi">Finland</country>
               </placeName> increasingly resisted German demands for continued co-operation,
                    and by September, 1944, had "floundered" out of the war and was compelled once
                    again to accept severe terms imposed by the U.S.S.R. But even yet the tortuous road was not ended.
                    It was not until April, 1945, that Hitler's warriors were completely expelled from the
                    Lapland region, where on their retreat they carried out extensive devastation.</p>
            <p>All of these Finnish misfortunes Professor Lundin recounts from the standpoints of both Finnish and
                    German participants and observers, frequently leaving widely divergent interpretations unreconciled,
                    the divergencies being <pb n="337" id="VAA4025-053-3-097"/> not merely between Finnish and German
                    writers, but also between Finns themselves and Germans themselves. His attempt at meticulous
                    accuracy appears successful, except when he makes Stalin prime minister a year and a half too soon
                    (p. 53). In attempting to be meticulously fair he hesitates to pass judgment on the
                    "Mannerheim Legend" as perpetuated in the Marshal's memoirs and on most
                    questions of right and wrong, but against Nazi <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> he does not hesitate to use such strong, though doubtless justified, language as
                    "the madmen in the Wilhelmstrasse" and the "monstrous regime" in
                    Berlin (pp. 49, 256). The book has no illustrations, and the one small closely packed map is
                    inadequate.</p>
            <p>The author occasionally allows himself a suggestive <hi rend="i">obiter dictum,</hi> such as
                    "Romanticism, unhampered by cold reality, can be a blessing for the arts, but it is almost
                    always disastrous in politics" (p. 118), that "once a war has begun and military
                    victory seems possible, even a nation which at the outset has regarded itself as fighting a
                    defensive war … wishes to impose a peace which will give it advantages not previously
                    enjoyed" (p. 136), and that "the corrosion of free institutions … often
                    takes place in the guise of intemperate and violent anti-Communism" (p. 256).</p>
            <p>Professor Lundin finds a happy ending to the tale of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fi">Finland</country>
                    </placeName>'s unhappy years. Unlike many countries to her south, <placeName>
                        <country reg="fi">Finland</country>
                    </placeName> has not fallen entirely under Soviet control, the U.S.S.R. having learned that she
                    "is poor material for a satellite state" (p. 252). With the decline of both the
                    Rightist and Leftist groups which had been influential before 1939, he believes that Finnish
                    democracy has "emerged from the war stronger than it had ever been," and that
                    Finnish achievements in housing and social services since 1944 have been "amazing"
                    (pp. 256, 257).</p>

            <p>Building on an earlier book about the office of governor in the South and traveling to twenty-five
                    states for observations <pb n="338" id="VAA4025-053-3-098"/> and interviews, the author has written
                    the "first descriptive and analytical study of the gubernatorial office on a nation-wide
                    basis." As a political scientist, Mr. Ransone is interested in the current status of the
                    governor rather than in the role of that official throughout American history. His research is
                    translated into an analysis of statistical materials, and on that basis he recommends improvements
                    in the executive branch of state government.</p>
            <p>One section describes "gubernatorial politics." The elections of 1930 to 1950 are
                    consulted to discover patterns of party politics, especially as they affect the governors. The Union
                    is divided into three categories: fourteen one-party states (all southern except two); twenty
                    "normally" Democratic or Republican states; and fourteen
                    "two-party" states (including Indiana, though the author did not travel to
                    Hoos-ierdom). In most states, consequently, the nominating process is more significant than the
                    election. Factionalism within parties is a filter through which an aspirant to the governorship must
                    pass. Not only must he campaign within this environment, but, if he is elected, he must somehow
                    maintain a working coalition of factions in order to be effective.</p>
            <p>Another section discusses the "executive function." An important ingredient in a
                    mass of responsibilities is the formation of policy, hampered by the political and constitutional
                    position of the average governor. In the absence of a genuine two-party situation, according to Mr.
                    Ransone, legislative-executive relations are frequently unsatisfactory. Furthermore, in devising a
                    budget, the key to any program, the governor is severely handicapped by constitutional provisions.
                    Closely associated with policy, management is a major duty and yet productive of gubernatorial
                    headaches. More often than not, the governor is simply the "first among equals,"
                    since the heads of departments and agencies are themselves usually elected, independent officers.
                    Thus the problem is persuasion as well as administration. The author would repose more power in the
                    governor's hands so as to achieve unified, efficient government. Naturally the adoption of
                    this proposal is not imminent, as he well knows, and he would accomplish a good deal through
                    remodeling the governor's staff organization. His discussion of this aspect is interesting
                    and valuable. Finally, the governor must devote much energy to public relations. In order to
                    eliminate excessive <pb n="339" id="VAA4025-053-3-099"/> demands upon the chief executive's
                    time, delegation of many of these tasks to the staff is urged.</p>
            <p>The work, as a whole, would have been better if the author had combined some history with his
                    analytical description. Selecting the method that he did, he can only assert, without demonstration,
                    that variations from state to state are explainable in terms of the "ecology" of
                    local conditions. Should objections on this ground be generously repressed, it is difficult to
                    approve the paucity of annotations. Lacking adequate footnotes, the book should certainly have
                    contained a bibliography. Readers tolerant of these faults will protest the fat of repetitious words
                    surrounding the muscle of ideas, convincing as they may be.</p>

            <p>This needed volume in many respects is well executed, but on the whole is deficient as a scholarly
                    publication. Here are the texts of major party platforms from 1840 through 1956 and likewise for a
                    significant number of lesser parties. Brief editorial notes are given for each presidential campaign
                    and the unabridged platforms are allowed to speak for themselves. The format—two columns
                    on large pages— makes the platforms readable and a concise table of contents makes them
                    easy to locate. Much research was obviously required to obtain and edit these national platforms.</p>
            <p>But there is a debit side of the ledger. The dates on which the platforms were adopted are not
                    indicated, nor the places where they were adopted. This is most unfortunate. Since the platforms in
                    particular campaigns are much influenced in their framing by whether they precede or follow rival
                    platforms, chronology is important and the accidents of location are also significant.</p>
            <p>Far worse than this, however, citations to the sources are lacking. In the preface the editors state
                    that varied sources have been used and "that sometimes there is variation in copies of a
                    platform obtained from the same party headquarters." They add that at times platforms
                    "obviously have been altered, edited, or corrected before being published <pb n="340" id="VAA4025-053-3-100"/> in party literature or pamphlets, and official records may be literally
                    non-existent." Under such circumstances neither the editors nor the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Press should have tolerated publication of so potentially useful a volume minus
                    citations to the sources used. So desirable, however, is this collection that this defect could be
                    remedied by the preparation of a brief guide to the sources for distribution to purchasers.</p>
            <p>The reviewer is reminded of a story the late Professor William 0. Lynch told students about a
                    manufacturer of blankets. This manufacturer claimed that his blankets were larger, but no more
                    expensive, than those of his competitors so that "it is the part that hangs over that keeps
                    you warm, but costs no more, which makes the difference." And so it is with the volume
                    under review. The editors presumably used particular sources in making transcripts and in proofing,
                    so that the citing of exact sources would have required but little additional effort and almost no
                    extra space or cost in publication. But in its existing state this volume will doubtless leave
                    reputable scholars skeptical and even cold unless they are detectives enough to find the sources or
                    able to persuade the editors to give them guidance through correspondence.</p>

                    </placeName> since the turn of the century. It is not so much a review of the struggle between the
                    parties as it is a study of the struggle among the factions within each party. This story of
                    factional struggles is largely a relation of their attempts to dominate the state party conventions,
                    to win the direct primary nominations, and to name delegates to the national convention. To tell
                    this story, the Sarasohns have taken each party separately and outlined the major features of
                    intraparty strife during the last fifty years. This strife has, of course, been affected <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-053-3-101"/> by the changing political strength and policies of the two parties. The
                    Republican party in <placeName>

                    the time of the Great Depression has suffered a general decline in its fortunes and in its voter
                    strength, while the Democratic party, poverty-ridden and hopeful only for the patronage to be gained
                    from national victories until sudden prosperity descended upon it after the Democratic landslide of
                    1932, and after a chaotic grab by many hands for control, developed a party organization and has
                    advanced in strength and in the number of Democratic voters. Much of the story is, of course, the
                    story of the entry of strong labor unions and automobile manufacturers into the controlling
                    positions in the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively.</p>

                    short to be of any great help to the general reader. Though not designed as a textbook, the book
                    suffers from the normal textbook complaints but will no doubt serve as an excellent starting point

                    the liberties of the citizens. It was greatly strengthened in later years so that it could perform
                        <pb n="342" id="VAA4025-053-3-102"/> the services which the citizens increasingly demanded of
                    the state government. This was a slow development and it was not until the twentieth century that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s governor was given the veto power.</p>
            <p>Very significant is the change in the educational picture. At the beginning most public schools were
                    of the one-room, isolated variety, administered and financed by the local school districts, but
                    since the passage in 1935 of the School Foundation Law and of the School Aid Law of 1955 the costs
                    of public education have been largely met out of state funds, and there has been a greatly increased
                    state supervisory role over the expenditure of these funds. To implement this supervisory function
                    more effectively a State Board of Education was established in 1955.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that the State Highway Patrol, in view of the lack of a state constabulary,
                    performs many of the functions which a constabulary would be expected to perform. In addition to its
                    main duty to enforce highway laws, it also maintains a communication network and keeps a fingerprint
                    file, a bogus check file, a rogue's gallery, and a "crime laboratory,"
                    which includes a lie-detector and other such equipment. All this is done under its authority to
                    patrol the highways.</p>
            <p>Because of the nature of the book—it is a summary of what the law is—the
                    general impression left is of achievement, of good intentions. This is a record of laws adopted by
                    the legislature and the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and not of the failures of legislation and enforcement. In general, therefore, there is
                    a tendency to feel a sense of pride in the accomplishments of the state and in the general evidence
                    of enlightenment and of intelligence shown in the handling of increasingly complex and difficult
                    economic, social, and political problems. However, the authors do recognize some shortcomings and
                    failures in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> government and administration. They admit that the two-man bipartisan Civil Service
                    Commission tends to produce, under certain circumstances, a kind of "covert spoils
                    system." The merit system is not effectively maintained at the county and municipal level,
                    partly because of inadequate appropriations by the legislature for local administration. Of course,
                    the simplest way to hamstring state agencies is to eliminate or reduce state appropriations for
                    financing such agencies. Such reductions <pb n="343" id="VAA4025-053-3-103"/> can always be
                    justified on the ground of economy. The extreme crowding and general inadequacy of state prisons and
                    mental hospitals are not overlooked, but attention is called to the attempts to do something to
                    improve these conditions. Admitted too is the so-called constitutional gerrymander by means of which
                    cities are kept in a kind of rotten-borough status.</p>
            <p>In general, the reviewer has little negative criticism of this book. At one point the authors refer
                    to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The somewhat confused statement of land claims toward the beginning of this book could
                    have been considerably clarified by the inclusion of a single map. There are a few minor misprints
                    and mechanical errors.</p>
            <p>On the whole, however, this is an enlightening book, which this reviewer recommends to legislators,
                    to the League of Women Voters, to other intelligent citizens of <placeName>

                    libraries, and to visitors from abroad who would understand the complexities, difficulties, and
                    advantages of the American federal system.</p>

                    </placeName>, a reviewer in this magazine, doubtless its editor Logan Esarey, wrote: "It is
                    a pleasure to turn from the deluge of historical trash thrown on the market at present to the work

                    employed in governmental duties for near a half century. Besides thus understanding his state and
                    his people and besides having a personal acquaintance with the geography of his state, he writes in
                    a pleasing style. The volume under review covers the territorial period, from the appearance of
                    Radisson and Groseilliers, about 1660, down to the constitutional convention in 1857."</p>

                    </placeName>'s centennial of statehood (1958) is doubly appropriate. Often episodical and
                    much prone to generalization and broad interpretations, it has numerous insights and shrewd
                    evaluations. In this reissue "no attempt has been made to incorporate newly discovered
                    sources or to bring Folwell's interpretations up to date in the light of subsequent
                    research. Only minor errors have been corrected, and new maps and illustrations have been
                    added" (p. vii).</p>
            <p>As indicated in the introduction, "recent scholarship has illustrated wide avenues in the
                    history of exploration and the fur trade—two fields in which this volume is perhaps
                    especially vulnerable to re-examination" (p. ix). Moreover, the last three to four decades
                    have brought augmented knowledge about the Indians, early settlements, and the like, but neither
                    foreknowledge nor hindsight are gifts which Clio bestows on even her most capable disciples!</p>

                    </placeName> State University which constituted a systematic analysis of the organization and
                    operation of the TVA.</p>
            <p>Although a half-dozen significant books have been published since 1950 on TVA, this volume is the
                    most readable study yet presented. Because of the careful editing, the work does not suffer from the
                    lack of continuity which often plagues a study of this kind. The topical organization is well done,
                    making the book's 282 pages a mine of information on the background, operation, and
                    accomplishments of the program. The chapter on "The Meaning of TVA" written by
                    Gordon R. Clapp, former Chairman of the Board of Directors, is probably the best concise description
                    of the Valley and its peoples, TVA workways, and the public issues concerned with its operation. In
                    each of the seventeen chapters the reader is reminded of the two most significant aspects of the
                    TVA—the broad scope of its work and the method employed to accomplish it.</p>
            <p>For the reader whose concept of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> Valley Authority ends with the production of hydro-electric power, the authors provide
                    a mild shock in their illuminating discussions of such topics as the river control system, the power
                    program, river transportation, reservoir land management, fertilizer-munitions and agriculture,
                    forestry, health, recreation, and economic development. The scope of the program is indeed broad. It
                    will be remembered that the TVA Act of 1933 set a precedent in its unique regional character. One of
                    the principal objections to the program was the fear that in the conduct of its business it would
                    become a Goliath for the state and local governments. Twenty years have proved this fear unfounded.
                    The TVA has in no way superseded the responsibilities of the state and local governments in their
                    respective areas. These governments have had the same legal rights since 1933 as before, with TVA
                    responsibilities superimposed on those of existing governments. <pb n="346" id="VAA4025-053-3-106"/>
                    "The most interesting thing about this arrangement and the most significant for
                    TVA's method of operation, is that the Authority has no coercive power whatever with regard
                    to the long-established governments of the region." Much of the government in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> Valley is accomplished by a system of co-operative administration which is based upon a
                    complex network of agreements encompassing all kinds of units, agencies, and groups. Interesting is
                    the observation that "the lessons of co-operative administration in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> Valley may be especially significant in these times of renewed public discussion of
                    states' rights and federal-state relations. The TVA, a distinctly American creation, may
                    yet be found to have pointed a middle course for those who would avoid the extremes of the apoplexy
                    of centralization and the anarchy of disunion" (p. 10). A treatment of the broader
                    implications of TVA, i.e. the TVA in state and local government and in its national and
                    international setting, is concluded with a review of the past policy decisions which have shaped the
                    organization. Also included is a timely presentation of the problems which lie ahead for the
                    Authority.</p>
            <p>To make any pretense that the contributors to this report are unbiased would be absurd. The nature of
                    the book is candidly declared in the introduction. "Here is no impartial
                    on-the-one-hand-but-then-again-on-the-other account of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> Valley Authority. Here, on the contrary, is an analysis by a devoted group of men who
                    participated responsibly in the forging of TVA." Although the book provides a helpful index
                    and informative charts and graphs, it does suffer from too little footnoting. The greatest
                    disappointment is the lack of any bibliography. This proves to be its only serious defect since the
                    volume otherwise represents an authoritative and comprehensive description of TVA. Perhaps the
                    decision not to include a bibliography was taken because of the 1953 publication by the TVA
                    Technical Library of a rather extensive one. However, the most helpful and up-to-date publication of
                    annotated references appears in Gordon R. Clapp's 1955 work, <hi rend="i">The TVA, An

                    that was a way of life. During two centuries and a half the Amish have kept this way of life with

                    country" recipes; plowing and planting without benefit of modern machinery; trading with
                    the same shrewdness; listening to the old-time, long-drawn-out sermons; and driving to town, church,
                    or making neighborly visits in the same kind of family wagons and bachelors' buggies to
                    which their ninth and tenth generation ancestors had been accustomed. Only the materials would be
                    machine made instead of homespun, men's and women's clothes to a certain extent
                    would be factory made, food would be more varied, possibly, and more plentiful, and surroundings
                    somewhat changed.</p>
            <p>With enormously increased funds to purchase any heart's desire, the Amish remain untempted
                    by electric or gasoline-powered luxuries. They prefer to avoid utility bills and bank
                    charges—at the same time eschewing the advantages of interest and dividend income, for
                    they are always prepared to dig up the bucket with $30,000 or $50,000 from the
                    corner of the hogpen to invest in another farm of black gold on which to produce more corn, tobacco,
                    or clover to sell for more gold.</p>

                    Even the few young people who are temporarily lured away by modern gadgets and customs usually
                    return to the fold of their ancestors after they assume the responsibilities of married life.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Bluegrass Cavalcade</hi> is an anthology of selected writings over the past two
                    centuries of various distinguished and not-so-distinguished authors who have dealt with the famed
                    Bluegrass region of central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Literary style as such has not been the criterion for inclusion: "A bit of
                    writing is considered good because it gives a sense of the immediate present in a particular period
                    in the Bluegrass story" (p. xiv). Yet Professor Clark has managed to include a large number
                    of excellent writers, both natives to the region and outsiders. History and fiction, tall tale and
                    romance, humor and pathos are here, ranging in mood from William Townsend's touching story
                    of the sale of Eliza to Allan Trout's eulogy of ham gravy.</p>
            <p>Here are writings exemplifying the "Promised Land" motif, including selections from
                    early historians such as John Filson and Gilbert Imlay, and descriptions of the Blue-grass of Henry
                    Clay (by Bernard Mayo) and of James Lane Allen (by Grant C. Knight). Here are the men who have made
                    the Bluegrass—adventurers, scoundrels, crude pioneers, and polished gentlemen. Found
                    together are such unlikely companions as Colonel David Meade of "Chaumière du <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName>"; Mr. Shelby of <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom's Cabin;</hi> Riley Grannan,
                    enterprising gambler; the drunken well-digger, John Robert Shaw; the Bluegrass gentleman-farmer, J.
                    Winston Coleman, <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-053-3-109"/> Jr.; and "Happy" Chandler,

                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> correspondent. Women also have their place in this portrait of the
                    Blue-grass—such women as the courageous Jane Todd Crawford; Irvin S. Cobb's Miss
                    Tessie, the "unreconstructed rebel"; the flirtatious "Belle of the
                    Yukon"; and the female relatives whom Cassius Clay so unflatteringly portrayed.</p>
            <p>One section of this book is devoted to the problems faced by Kentuckians throughout their
                    history—religious problems, epidemics, court trials, the Civil War. Professor Clark has
                    collected vivid accounts of the Cane Ridge Revival of 1801 and of the Beauchamp and Wickliffe
                    trials; Joseph Hergesheimer's and John Fox's portrayals of the plight of the
                    Bluegrass people during the Civil War; Joe <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> on a near-lynching; and Henry Watterson on Reconstruction.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the high point of the book is the section entitled "The Sports of
                    Gentlemen," for here are described the varied and lively diversions of Bluegrass
                    Kentuckians for generations: politics, horses, rifles, whiskey, and burgoo. Quarter racing has been
                    a Bluegrass pastime, too, as well as that undercover sport which even today is carried on beyond
                    closed farm gates—cockfighting.</p>
            <p>It would not be difficult to criticize an anthology for its omissions. But <hi rend="i">Bluegrass
                        Cavalcade</hi> is not pretentious nor does it claim authority. It is a charming collection of
                    writings about a unique region and it is aimed at the general reader. Professor Clark, through the
                    impartiality and balance of his selections, has succeeded to some extent in dissipating the aura of
                    romance which has long surrounded the Bluegrass region, a region which to many people has meant only
                    white columns and fences, sleek horses, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Colonels. He has combined flattering with unflattering descriptions of the Bluegrass;
                    he has painted a picture of a region and its people, conscious of their individuality, proud of
                    their past, hesitant to admit outside influence; and he has treated this Bluegrass pride and its
                    attendant capacity for misdeeds with considerable fairness. The result is "a taste of the
                    rich regional flavor" for the mature reader and for the youthful reader an introduction to <placeName>

            <p>Within the last two decades an increasing number of professional historians have been directing their
                    attention to medical history. Dean of these is Richard H. Shryock, director of the John Hopkins
                    Institute of the History of Medicine. Thomas N. Bonner is a talented newcomer to this group. He
                    first attracted notice from the medical profession in 1952–1953, while he was dean of
                    William Woods College, through his articles "Dr. Nathan Smith Davis and Growth of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Medicine 1850–1900" and "The Social and Political
                    Attitudes of Midwestern Physicians 1840–1940: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a Case History." He is now associate professor of history and chairman of
                    the department of social sciences at the University of Omaha.</p>
            <p>The present volume was prepared under a special fellowship provided by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Medical Society. The studies just mentioned together with one on Dr. Bayard Holmes made
                    the selection of Dr. Bonner as writer for "a history of medicine in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> area in its geographic, social, racial, and economic environment" the logical
                    one. The editing of the manuscript was done by Miss Gayle Thornbrough of the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau. Appropriately, the foreword is by Dr. Shryock.</p>

                        </placeName>
               </hi> is essentially a social history. It deals with the origin and development of
                    the city's medical schools and hospitals, the story of its professional societies and
                    publications, its emergence as a force in twentieth century medicine, the expansion of medical
                    education, the progress of public health work, the interrelation of the medical profession and the
                    public, etc. This perspective represents a departure from most medico-historical treatises which
                    focus attention on outstanding personalities, their ideas and deeds, rather than on the social
                    implications of medicine. In spite of this perspective, however, the individual lives of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s medically great are by no means neglected; but such biographic material as
                    is incorporated will be found to be deftly interwoven with the greater story "of how <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> grew from a small disease-ridden settlement—and became <pb n="351" id="VAA4025-053-3-111"/> the great medical center it is today." The study is a solid
                    one, fully documented, constituting in Dr. Shryock's opinion the most thorough analysis of
                    the medical experience of an American city that has thus far been made.</p>
            <p>That a degree of discord between the writer and the sponsoring group came to exist may be presumed
                    from the "Statement" introduced by the Committee on Medical History of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Medical Society. After averring that the author was given freedom to tell the story in
                    his own way, the members proceed to say: "Frankly, this Committee disagrees with some of
                    Dr. Bonner's conclusions and his appraisal of some of the personalities and events that
                    made medical history in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>." "A layman," they explain, "may not always
                    appreciate the power that some esoteric factors such as the Code of Medical Ethics have on the lives
                    of members of the medical profession."</p>
            <p>This is the difference of viewpoint to be expected between those seeing medicine from the inside and
                    those viewing it from without. The great merit of the work lies in the very circumstance that by
                    playing down the personal aspects of medical history a record is achieved which turns out to be more
                    or less typical of the course of medical development in the metropolitan center. The illustrations
                    are few and in two instances none too happily chosen. The style is that commonly found in factual
                    exposition, neither particularly pedestrian nor especially stimulating.</p>

                    the study has significance as a notable contribution to the socio-cultural and medical development
                    of the Midwest.</p>

                    sub-assemblies, and partially processed materials. Studies of urban geographers are cited to show
                    that <placeName>

                    </placeName> is located within the area of highest potential manufacturing sales and the belt of
                    lowest transportation costs. This favorable location is cited as the primary basis for potential
                    industrial growth.</p>
            <p>Also discussed are the physical pattern of urban growth; the locational pattern of manufacturing
                    areas; the major <pb n="353" id="VAA4025-053-3-113"/> types of economic activities furnishing
                    employment; the major types of manufacturing activity by census categories; the ownership of firms;
                    the markets served; estimates of labor productivity; the seasonality of production and employment;
                    the age, sex, and skill of the population and the labor force; transportation agencies used; the
                    sources of supplies and raw materials; and the extent of union organization and labor problems for
                    the last ten years. Special attention is given to the degree of specialization or
                    non-diversification within manufacturing employment and its economic consequences and to the role of
                    the eight major manufacturers who together used 80 per cent of the area's manufacturing
                    employment. The final chapter describes efforts currently being made to plan community development
                    and industrial growth in the area in terms of both expansion and diversification.</p>
