                    on which he printed handbills, legal notices, songs, and poems expressing his
                    political and temperance views. Occasionally he published a newspaper variously

                    Harrison, the Whig candidate for the presidency in 1840, and his songs and poems
                    were distributed to many newspapers in the state. During the campaign he took

                    one of the most widely read weeklies in the region. Bowser kept a sharp eye on
                    local and regional events and developments which were faithfully reported to the
                        <hi rend="i">Tribune's</hi> readers. The local news was fully

            <p>Although Chesterton and Porter were less than a mile apart, Bowser in July, 1894,
                    demonstrated his faith in the latter's industrial potential by

                    Smith's connection with the paper immediately brought favors from the

                    sausage-makers. As a large number came directly from the old country and could

            <p>Porter B. Towle founded the <hi rend="i">Western Indiana Tribune</hi>, a
                    Republican paper, at Hammond in December, 1880. The paper was sold to Alfred A.
                    Winslow in July, 1881, under whom it became the <hi rend="i">Hammond
                    Tribune.</hi> The <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> ran as a weekly until 1883 when
                    Winslow commenced the first daily in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Winslow may rightfully be called the father
                    of the English-language press in Hammond. The success of the <hi rend="i">Hammond Tribune</hi> was due largely to its support of Marcus M. Towle,
                    mayor of Hammond from 1884 to 1888. The paper's mission was largely
                    political and it was said that it "went strong during campaign years
                    and slumped terribly between fights."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Winslow
                    sold the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> in 1893 to W. J. Maxwell when he entered the

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Hammond Tribune</hi> changed hands frequently after Winslow left
                    the city. Thomas J. Hyman of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> bought the paper in 1894 and sold it to James G. and Henry Davidson
                    of Whiting, who in turn disposed of it to Allison A. Bibler, the publisher of

               <hi rend="sup">48</hi> Winslow returned to
                    Hammond newspaper circles for a short time when he purchased the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> from Bibler in July, 1904. But in September, 1905, Winslow
                    sold the paper back to Bibler, who immediately disposed of it to a syndicate of
                    local men headed by Ralph B. Bradford.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>James B. Woods, postmaster and also city clerk, founded the <hi rend="i">Hammond

                    incumbent, Marcus M. Towle, in the elections of that year. Hammond's
                    victory apparently convinced Woods that the <hi rend="i">Hammond
                    Independent</hi> had achieved its objective and the paper was discontinued.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> In 1890 Mr. and Mrs. Silas E. Swaim started the <hi rend="i">

                    Winslow as one of the brightest figures in Hammond's journalistic
                    history. The Democratic party's ability to compete on fairly equal
                    terms with the Republicans in the city was due largely to Swaim's
                    paper. In 1891 Swaim bought the <list type="footnotes">

                    wealthy <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> grain and stockbroker, marked the beginning of a new era in the
                    newspaper history of the region. Until that time most of the publishers in the
                    area had been men of limited means and their papers, on the whole, led a
                    hand-to-mouth existence. McHie possessed the business genius, energy, and
                    capital to publish a newspaper on a scale never before attempted in the Calumet
                    Region. He had already demonstrated his confidence that Hammond was destined to
                    be an important industrial city by building both the Hammond Building, at Hohman
                    and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> streets, and the Hammond grain elevator, and by making heavy
                    investments in local real estate. The capitalist reasoned that a good newspaper
                    was needed to advertise the city and that in time such a project would also be
                        profitable.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>McHie changed the name of the <hi rend="i">Hammond Tribune</hi> to the <hi rend="i">

                    limit its circulation to Hammond alone. The first issue of the <hi rend="i">Times</hi>, a Republican paper, was published June 18, 1906. The proprietor
                    brought his brothers into the publishing organization, William A. McHie as

                    C. Oliver Holmes. Holmes, the first town clerk of Gary and a member of its first

                    in which Knotts had an interest, accused the McHies of being hostile to Knotts

            <p>Whiting was a fertile field for weekly newspapers from its early years. The city
                    dates from 1889 when the Standard Oil Company started the construction of its
                    refinery there. Its population was 3,983 in 1900 and 10,880 in 1930.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> Although Whiting's population was small compared
                    with neighboring cities, the community was from its inception the most
                    prosperous and stable in the region. The refinery, around which the city was
                    built, provided steady employment for its workers in periods of depression as
                    well as in boom times. The reading public of Whiting was unusually numerous for
                    a city of its size because the refinery employed a larger number of skilled
                    workers than did most industries.</p>
            <p>Whiting's earliest newspaper was founded about a year after the
                    construction of the refinery began. In November, 1890, David A. Holman, pastor
                    of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Congregational Church, started the <hi rend="i">Congregationalist</hi> for circulation among the members of his flock. The
                    publication was so well received that Holman expanded its scope and in January,
                    1891, changed its name to the <hi rend="i">Whiting News.</hi> As such, it was
                    the purveyor of local news and gossip. When ministerial duties called him
                    elsewhere, Holman sold the paper to James G. Davidson, a young real estate
                    dealer who intended to use it to advertise his business. The new publisher made
                    a big splurge and printed ten thousand copies each week to circulate in a
                    Whiting that then boasted less than three thousand people. The magnitude of
                    these operations was such a drain on the young realtor's pocketbook
                    that he sold the <hi rend="i">News</hi> to his brother, Henry S. Davidson, in

                    Pullman strike. The trains stopped running and with them the flow of food and

                    that if the editor had any other duty to perform on print day the paper simply
                    did not appear.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> James G. Davidson had a talent for
                    writing, and his pungent articles published under the name of

                    The Freemans opposed such a step, pointing out that a large segment of the

                    intention to support the Independent party, Republican leaders felt desperately
                    the need of a daily paper. They adopted the slogan, "We want a
                    daily," and turned to the Freemans for such a paper. The Freemans were
                    repeatedly promised unlimited moral and financial support if they would convert
                    their paper to a daily. Sincere in their belief that the Republicans had the
                    best candidate for mayor and encouraged by such offers of support, the Freemans
                    began to issue the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> as a daily a few months before the

                    to maintain law and order.<hi rend="sup">90</hi> The Independent party was
                    victorious in the election. In the course of the excitement that occurred when
                    the results were known, a number of the more exuberant supporters of the winning

                    regardless of which side won, never dreaming however of what was really in
                    store. Before midnight it was evident that Callahan was the victor but the
                    shouting was in full swing until long past that hour and we stayed on until 3
                    a.m. A taxi stopped across the street and believing it to be the one we had
                    ordered, Joe locked the door and we started across. But just as we reached it,
                    it pulled out, the driver muttering: 'No more fares tonight.'
                    We stood there expecting our own taxi momentarily. While we waited, another car,
                    not however a taxi, drove up and stopped in front of the shop. A number of men
                    piled out of it at once, but immediately piled in again, one of them remarking
                    loudly as he glanced our way: 'This isn't the place, its a
                    block down'. Joe thought he recognized the car but in the dim light
                    that filtered through the window it was impossible to recognize the faces of the
                    passengers. As it drove off our taxi appeared from the opposite direction,
                    stopped to pick us up, and we were driven to our home.</p>
            <p>"In view of what happened shortly afterwards we later became convinced
                    that the car we had been watching contained the men responsible for the wrecking
                    of our plant. Our belief was confirmed later. We learned that the same car
                    returned very shortly after we took our departure, and its occupants went into
                    action. Albert, the porter, an old derelict who slept on the premises had been a
                    witness to everything. He related that shortly after 3 o'clock hearing
                    a racket he rose from his bed which was at the back of the shop and ran out to
                    see what was doing. He encountered six or eight well-dressed men wearing masks
                    who after threatening him with revolvers into silence went to work on the
                    machinery. They smashed and hacked at everything in sight, not only the presses
                    and linotype machines but the furniture, telegraph instruments, typewriters and
                    even an umbrella had been attacked with sledge hammers and other damage-dealing
                    implements. … It was not long before Joe learned the identity of
                    those who participated in the raid; and I knew from him at the time who they
                    were. But at this late date I have forgotten most of them and of those I do
                    recall hazily I have forgotten the first names, or their initials."<hi rend="sup">91</hi>

                    company in the management of Gary's affairs. While Armanis F. Knotts
                    denied that he had any connection with the paper, he and his brother apparently
                    encouraged and favored it in various ways.<hi rend="sup">103</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Northern Indianian's</hi> failure within three years of
                    its establishment was apparently caused by a combination of circumstances. The
                    steel company, which supplied the young community with electricity, gas, and
                    water, also sought the franchise to build and operate the street railway system,
                    but the town board, largely through the influence of Thomas E. Knotts, granted
                    the concession to the privately owned Gary and Interurban Traction Company. When
                    the <hi rend="i">Northern Indianian</hi> went out of business, the claim was
                    made that its demise was due to the failure of the Gary and Interurban Traction
                    Company to keep its promise to pay for the presses and other equipment of the
                    paper, but no proof was ever offered that such was the case.<hi rend="sup">104</hi> Other factors apparently affected the fortunes of the <hi rend="i">Indianian.</hi> For instance, Costello's aggressive and vitriolic
                    editorials were resented by the steel company's officials and also by
                    the conservative segment of Gary's citizens. The editor's
                    favorite target was Horace S. Norton, the steel company's most
                    prominent official at that time, whom he persistently called "Turkey
                        Neck."<hi rend="sup">105</hi> Norton was the founder and president
                    of the Gary Commercial Club, an association of merchants and professional men,
                    which functioned as a sort of chamber of commerce. A study showed that the
                    leading merchants favored the <hi rend="i">Gary Daily Tribune</hi> for
                    advertising while the <hi rend="i">Northern Indianian</hi> depended upon the
                    uncertain support of small scale realtors. This situation may have been due to
                    Norton's influence. Costello's associate Benthal was thought
                    to be a Socialist and such a rumor may have been a liability to the paper.<hi rend="sup">106</hi> The <hi rend="i">Northern Indianian</hi> closed its
                    doors in March, 1909. Costello left a bewildered foreman in charge of the
                    offices and equipment and returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The paper's creditors petitioned the circuit court to
                    determine its ownership. There were rumors that Thomas E. Knotts would assume
                    control of the establishment when the matter was settled in the courts.<hi rend="sup">107</hi> When that time came, as shall be seen, Knotts and his
                    brother, Armanis F., did buy the equipment and began the publication of the <hi rend="i">Gary Evening Post.</hi>

            <p>The founding of the <hi rend="i">Gary Weekly Tribune</hi> in June, 1907, by Homer
                    J. Carr and George R. Scott was an important event in Gary's
                    journalistic history. Carr was editor and Scott was in charge of its business
                    office. Both were veteran newspapermen who had worked together in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> for some years. In 1891 Carr had been hired by the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName> Tribune</hi> to organize a telegraphic marine news service for
                    some forty newspapers in the lower Great Lakes region. Scott became assistant
                    manager of this news bureau. Carr was marine correspondent for the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName> Tribune</hi> when he came to Gary. Because Carr had long been
                    connected with the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName> Tribune</hi>, he and Scott chose the name of <hi rend="i">Gary
                        Weekly Tribune</hi> for the new journal.<hi rend="sup">108</hi> The office
                    of the paper was first located in a rude shack on what was then Euclid Avenue,
                    just west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Later it was moved across <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> to where the Union Railway Station now stands. For some months the
                    local news and advertisements were collected by Mark Goodnow and Fred Carr and
                    mailed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the editor and business manager had the type set and the
                    papers printed. They were then sent back to Gary for distribution on Saturday
                    mornings. This procedure was followed until the spring of 1908, when Carr and
                    Scott built a plant at 670 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> and installed modern equipment. By 1912 the paper had outgrown its
                    quarters and moved to its second home at Fifth and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">109</hi> On Labor Day, September 7, 1908, the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> became a daily, the first to be printed in Gary,
                    though the weekly edition was continued for several years. Carl O. Dennewitz,
                    another prominent figure in the city's newspaper circles, joined the
                    staff of the <hi rend="i">Weekly Tribune</hi> as a cub reporter. He later became
                    managing editor of the <hi rend="i">Gary Daily Tribune</hi> and remained in that
                    position until he joined the army in 1917.<hi rend="sup">110</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Carr and Scott were Republicans and, except for the elections of 1912 when they
                    supported the Bull Moose ticket, their papers were the partisan spokesmen of the
                    Republican party in local politics. The <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> papers were
                    also the spokesmen of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Steel Corporation in civic affairs, and Carr was an intimate friend
                    of William P. Gleason, superintendent of the steel works. Nevertheless, a few
                    Democrats were connected with the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> papers. Arthur P.

            <p>The great real estate boom, which provided profitable advertising, coupled with
                    the unsettled state of political affairs during Gary's early years,
                    attracted other newspapers to the city. The <hi rend="i">Gary Daily News</hi>,
                    edited by Carl J. Cooper and Alfred Jones, was started in November, 1907. This
                    paper, printed in <placeName>

                    launched in December, 1908, with a piano as the grand prize. Several of the
                    city's most prominent young ladies entered the contest, and numerous
                    people were persuaded to pay for subscriptions six years in advance, but the
                    paper failed in March, 1909. The subscribers lost their money and the winner of
                    the contest never saw the piano.<hi rend="sup">113</hi> Next came the <hi rend="i">

                    mayor in the city elections of that year. Alfred Jones was one of its editors,
                    and John F. Dorman was one of its founders.<hi rend="sup">114</hi> The success
                    of Knotts in the election caused the demise of the paper early in 1910.</p>
            <p>Gary became a fifth class city in October, 1909. Thomas E. Knotts, president of
                    the town board since 1906, was eager to be the city's first mayor. A
                    strong and controversial figure, he was opposed not only by the Republicans but
                    also by an insurgent faction in the Democratic party. Since the <hi rend="i">Northern Indianian</hi> had closed its doors in March, 1909, none of the
                    newspapers in Gary was friendly to him. Both the <hi rend="i">Gary Daily

                    from getting the Democratic nomination. Therefore in August, 1909, Knotts and
                    his brother, Armanis F., bought the equipment of the defunct <hi rend="i">Northern Indianian</hi> at a mortgage sale and established the <hi rend="i">Gary Evening Post.</hi>

                    $15,000 but could find few purchasers in the lull that followed the
                    election. In later years Cannon recalled their troubles: "We were

                    election the <hi rend="i">Post</hi> announced that henceforth it would be a free
                    lance in public matters, <hi rend="sup">125</hi> yet for some years the Snyders
                    showed a tendency to support the Democratic party. In 1915 Henry Burgess Snyder
                    was appointed postmaster of Gary by President Wilson and held that position
                    until late in 1920. The <hi rend="i">Post</hi> urged the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to join the League of Nations after World War I and was a
                    consistent advocate of closer co-operation between the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and other nations of the world. It also agreed with the Democrats
                    that the tariff should be kept at a low level, while it went down the line in
                    support of the Democratic tickets, both national and local, in the elections of
                        1920.<hi rend="sup">126</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Snyders again announced in January, 1921, that in the future their paper
                    would be independent in politics. They denied that the decision to retire as
                    spokesman for a particular party was due to any political disappointments. The
                        <hi rend="i">Gary Evening Post</hi>, they said, had been Democratic because
                    it believed in the principles of Woodrow Wilson. It would support the Democratic
                    party in the future whenever that party stood by the interests of men, women,
                    and children everywhere. But the political situation was different in the state,
                    county, and city, particularly in the last two. These, the announcement
                    continued, were business institutions that should be conducted on business
                    principles, and that in the city and county there was no inherent reason why
                    anyone should vote either the Republican or Democratic ticket. In conclusion the
                    opinion was expressed that "without a party we believe we can stand for
                    the best interests of the community in a way that the public will understand and
                    appreciate." The Snyders went on to praise the administration of Mayor
                    William F. Hodges of Gary, a Republican, but declared that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName>, also with a Republican administration, was not so fortunate.<hi rend="sup">127</hi> The Snyders probably realized the futility of supporting
                    the Democratic party in the city and county, which were consistently Republican
                    before the depression which began in 1929. Thomas E. Knotts, whose victory in
                    1909 was largely a personal one, was the only Democratic mayor of Gary until
                        1935.<hi rend="sup">128</hi> In view of this political situation, one can
                    understand the reasoning on the part of the Snyders that they could be a greater
                    influence for good in local affairs if they were independent rather than on the
                    "outside" as Democrats. Whether their course <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The depression that followed World War I, combined with an increase in the cost
                    of newspaper publication, brought financial difficulties to the <hi rend="i">Gary Daily Tribune</hi> and to the <hi rend="i">Gary Evening Post.</hi>
                    Their incomes were further diminished because merchants could not afford to
                    advertise in both papers. As a result, the two papers were hardly more than
                    breaking even.<hi rend="sup">129</hi> Under existing conditions it was doubtful
                    that Gary was large enough to support two daily newspapers. Of the two, the <hi rend="i">Gary Evening Post</hi> presented the more sprightly appearance and
                    was also in a better financial condition.</p>
            <p>Early in May, 1921, Carr sold the controlling interest in the <hi rend="i">Gary
                        Daily Tribune</hi> to Dennewitz and Charles Emley. A short time later, on
                    May 21, they sold it to Edward C. Toner, publisher of the <hi rend="i">Anderson
                        Herald</hi> at Anderson, Indiana.<hi rend="sup">130</hi> Robert B. Phillips,
                    also of the <hi rend="i">Anderson Herald</hi>, who had had five years of
                    newspaper experience in Gary, became editor while Emley remained on its staff as
                    business manager. The paper was to be independent in politics. Toner was soon
                    beset with the same financial problems that had troubled the previous owners of
                    the <hi rend="i">Tribune.</hi> On July 9, 1921, he sold the paper to the Snyders
                    and returned to Anderson.<hi rend="sup">131</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Snyders combined the <hi rend="i">Post</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>
                    into the <hi rend="i">Gary Evening Post and Daily Tribune.</hi> The new paper,
                    which was housed in the old <hi rend="i">Gary Daily Tribune</hi> Building at
                    Fifth and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was put into circulation on Monday, July 11, 1921. Its officials
                    were Henry Burgess Snyder, editor; Henry Richard Snyder, associate editor; J.
                    Ralph Snyder, business manager; and Herbert R. Snyder, in charge of commercial
                    printing. George R. Scott, one of the founders of the <hi rend="i">Gary Daily
                        Tribune</hi> who had retained a financial interest in the paper, was
                    secretary of the new organization. The Snyders began the publication of the <hi rend="i">Gary Sunday Post</hi> in the same month only to discover within a
                    short time that Gary was not yet ready for a local Sunday paper.<hi rend="sup">132</hi> In August, 1922, the name of the Snyder's paper was
                    simplified to the <hi rend="i">Gary Post-Tribune.</hi> Although officially

            <p>Any history of the region's newspapers would be incomplete without the
                    story of Thomas H. Cannon, one of its very able working newspapermen. Cannon
                    started his newspaper career in 1874 and for more than fifteen years worked as a
                    reporter and editor in <placeName>

                    with the area before coming to Gary. At the time Thomas E. Knotts engaged him

                    strike of 1919 was his last bit of heavy newspaper reporting. Feeling the weight
                    of the years, Cannon devoted most of his time after that to editorial duties and
                    to his daily columns. To quote his own words: "The end of the trail had

                    features of those papers for many years. The title "Flue Dust"
                    was no doubt inspired by the smoke and dust which poured constantly from the
                    flues and stacks of the great steel mills and which, when the atmosphere was
                    heavy and the wind came from off the lake, moved like a fog over the city.
                    Cannon started the "Flue Dust" column in 1913 and conducted it
                    until shortly before his death. The column consisted at first of verse and prose
                    written by Cannon in which he interspersed satirical and humorous comments about
                    current events, both local and national. In 1915 contributions were received
                    from his readers and from members of the newspaper staff. The first contributor
                    was Margaret K. Hanlan, society editor of the paper, who as
                    "Pandora" sent in exceptionally fine poems and sprightly
                    skits. As time went on, poems, jokes, and timely bits of wisdom came from the
                    pens of contributors with such names as "The Grey Courier,"
                    "Merely Gene," "Uncle Spud,"
                    "Shoe-Shine Socrates," "Rhoda Dendron,"
                    "Oh Hek," and numerous others. Contributions came not only
                    from Gary's citizens but from people in nearby states. For some years
                    Cannon published the best of the "Flue Dust" material annually
                    in a booklet called "The Log Book." Cannon also created
                    "Lud Wrangler," whose letters and musings were daily features
                    of the newspaper's editorial page.<hi rend="sup">136</hi> He also

                    </placeName> were not very well informed about the weather they would find, they
                    do seem to have been forewarned of the sicknesses to be endured while they
                    became acclimated: it was as much a part of the undertaking as the fatigues and
                    dangers of the journey. Like explorers of every period, most of them brought
                    their own medicaments with them, such as laudanum or quinine, called
                    "barks"; but many considered dogwood bark, plentiful in the
                    vicinity, as efficacious as Peruvian. Sometimes they collected and brewed their
                    own herb remedies. On the flyleaf of Jones and Stockwell's ledger for
                    1822, the "year of the terrible sickness," when Governor
                    Jonathan Jennings ordered a day set aside for special prayer and fasting because
                    of the statewide illness, was written "A recpt for curing the Ague and
                    fever. Take one third Reubarb and two thirds best Barks, mix them with Brandy or
                    old whisky until they are about as thin as rich cream.—take a
                    wineglass full 4 or 5 times a day. If it gripes too severely, dilute it with
                        water."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Of these ingredients perhaps the
                    brandy was considered the most important and the most potent; it was readily
                    obtainable, since it was manufactured locally by the barrelful.</p>
            <p>Although they had no clear theory of the causes of the inevitable sickness that
                    all newcomers had to undergo, the early settlers were positive that it was
                    related to the air and that the air was different in different localities. They
                    thought that hills on a dry soil were healthful, provided they were not near the
                    woods; on the other hand, the neighborhood of overflowing streams and all wet,
                    marshy soils were supposed to produce fevers and agues in the autumn. But the
                    weather was also to blame, for even if all the conditions of the locality were
                    propitious, heat and rain could bring the sickness. Timothy Flint, for instance,
                    commented, "In point of salubrity, we can do no more than repeat the
                    remarks, which <list type="footnotes">

                    and rot, and impregnate the air with pestilence." He also commented,

                    attracted by the fine land, on one of the prairie creeks, where no American
                    would live on any terms, all fell sick, one died, and the farmer and his wife
                    both lay unable to help themselves, or get help, except from one of their little

                    of disease. My shepherd and his family came, bringing a few choice sheep and an
                    English highbred cow. His whole family, in a few days, all fell sick, lying in a
                    small cabin just built about a hundred yards from my own. Mr. White, carpenter,

                    sons were speedily taken with fever and ague, to us then a new disease. Miss
                    [Maria] Fordham, who shared our cabin, was attacked with the same disease. My
                    constitution, strong and good, yielding from exposure to heat and rain, took
                    another form of disease. Boils and irritable sores broke out on both my legs,
                    from knee to ankle, incapacitating me, for a time, from walking."
                    Flower's new baby died and his young brother William, the favorite of

                    over the body, crusting and festering the hands and other parts, and is not to
                    be cured by the common treatment for the itch, which has been tried without
                    effect, and one instance has been known, where the sulphur and grease killed the

                    constantly supplying me with corn meal gruel and chicken broth prevented me from
                    sinking under the violence of my disorder. The fever soon became a regular

                    suffer a change of constitution, and that this change will be produced or

            <p>Sometimes there was no illness that could be traced, but there was a period of

            <p>Nobody explained to these critics that they were observing the poisonous
                    aftereffects of malarial infection. Though most of them complained of the
                    fearful swellings caused by bites of all kinds, mosquitoes among them, nobody of
                    course understood the real nature of malaria or the method of its transmission.
                    Faux described the annoyance caused by mosquitoes but had no idea of their real
                    significance: "Through the summer, both night and day, but mostly in

                    typhoid. Camp sanitation was something to which no one paid much attention; the

            <p>The sale of medicine proceeded at an even rate during the ensuing years. To the
                    nostrums given above were added as time went on various others such as Blue Mass
                    Pills, Bateman's drops, castor oil, paregoric, laudanum, oil of
                    worm-seed, spirits of turpentine, hartshorn, calomel, Harlem oil, calomel and
                    jalop, opodeldoc, extract of peppermint, mercurial ointment, red
                    "percepitate," Epsom salts, "strengthening
                    plarsters," and endless amounts of wine, brandy, and cordials, reputed
                    the very best medicine of all. The quantities sold varied with the season but
                    reached a peak in fall and winter. In 1822, "the year of the terrible
                    sickness," and in 1823, almost as bad locally, every customer who came
                    into the store bought at least one kind of medicine and sometimes several. Even
                    if nothing were known from other sources, these records alone would make plain
                    the fact that something catastrophic was happening.</p>

                    practised medicine but to have sold drugs in wholesale quantities. In March,
                    1816, he received a credit of $272.00 by his bill of medicine, less
                    $2.78 for transportation of 139 pounds from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> at 2¢ a pound. Two broken bottles of Balm of Iberia cost
                    him $4.00; two bottles of toothache drops and one bottle of eyewater,
                    also broken, cost him $1.50. In 1822 he owed $7.49 for

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>

                    next few years, he bought from the store various medicines for his patients,
                    among whom were Colonel John I. Neely, General Robert M. Evans, and Charles

                    month and ended on February 18, 1823. On February 22 Fullerton took over. In
                    August, 1823, Fullerton bought from Stockwell four dozen vials and a bottle of
                    castor oil, sending a boy on this errand; presumably he retailed the oil in the
                    small vials. This pattern was repeated at intervals during several years. In
                    1824 his bill for medicine was $114.13, which with cost of
                    transportation amounted to $122.28. He was married: his account shows
                    purchases "per lady" of 6 yards of Irish linen,
                    $4.50, and a pair of silk gloves, $1.00. In 1823 Fullerton
                    bought a hat from Jones and Stockwell for $6.00, charged to Charles
                    La Serre, who had married Maria Fordham. Fullerton's name appears for a

            <p>Dr. Walter and Dr. Foster were business partners for a long time, beginning in
                    1819. Since they dealt in general merchandise as well as drugs, it is natural
                    that their names do not appear among the customers of Jones and Stockwell, but
                    both are on the tavern accounts. Walter's (sometimes spelled Waters)
                    bill there started in January, 1819, with the sum of $10.54 1/2
                    brought down from 1818. He continued to buy breakfasts and horse feed, wine,
                    dinner, his man's dinner, sangaree, and board for twenty days. He went
                    to every ball: December, 1818, "to ball club, 3.00"; January
                    1, 1819, "To Ball club for self and brother, 2.00"; February
                    26, "To ball bill, 1.00"; March 10, "To ball club for
                    S. Browning, 1.00"; March 12, "To club at ball per ditto
                    1.00." His total bill at this time came to $46.29 1/2,
                    against which he received a credit by bill rendered of $34.29 1/2. On
                    June 9, 1821, he was one of the fifty-five who dined at the tavern with General
                    Harrison at $1.25 a plate. Walter's bill at the end of the
                    summer came to $81.64, carried to Ledger D. Fordham paid
                    "Dr. Waters" $23.75 and Birkbeck paid him
                    $8.00, this being the third doctor Birkbeck called in.</p>
            <p>Foster began boarding at the tavern on March 20, 1820. He went to several balls,
                    had various drinks, sangaree, punch, a glass of "todda," owed
                    for horsekeep, and on July 8 owed the tavern $58.41. He continued
                    along the same lines until in October the amount was $119.50. Against
                    this sum are credits by cash paid, $50.00, and by account rendered to

            <p>Dr. Joel F. Casey was a conspicuous figure in the community after his arrival in
                    1816 until his untimely death in 1828. One of the group of young professional
                    men who boarded at the tavern, he went to all the balls and stopped in nearly

                            early days the name Jerauld was always accented on the last syllable as

            <p>An itemized list of entries relating to him at Stockwell's and the
                    tavern would be long, for he was a frequent and rather extravagant purchaser,
                    many of his things being labeled "fancy" or
                    "fine" and above average in cost. On at least one occasion his

                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>

                    bought expensive vest patterns, one after the other, down the page. Casey had
                    big bills at the balls too, and his liquor bills often specified "bowl
                    of punch," "part in egg-nog," "two glasses
                    wine," "club at egg-nog," "domestic wine

                    liked to entertain his friends. He paid $8.00 for two
                    "scholers" at whatever lessons it was that Mrs. Lora Chandler
                    gave in the ballroom at the tavern, and he bought two small books for Christmas
                    gifts—the only time the word "Christmas" is used in
                    these pages.</p>
            <p>As was customary at this time when hard money was scarce, many patients paid
                    their doctor's bills by placing credits to his accounts at the store or
                    tavern—a very convenient way for the historian to find out what they
                    were: Andrew Ralston, $5.50; Henry Hopkins, $13.00; James
                    McGarrah, $2.00; James McClure, $3.00; Alexander Nicoll,
                    $15.00; Jacob Braselton, $8.00; James Evans,
                    $10.75; <placeName>

                    $12.00; B. Armistead, $4.00. Some of these were paid by
                    note, some in cash; and Casey made a good many cash deposits himself without
                    specifying the source. His total for the year was $995.003/4 which is
                    marked "settled Jan. 22, 1820."</p>
            <p>Casey sold a horse for $40.00 and a note is made that on February 15,

                        <p>Pappy thought that he would write his little boy a little letter.
                                    I am in a little house made of little logs, this little house
                                    has a little fire place in it, and this cold day pappy keeps a
                                    big fire. I just got done browning some rye for to make coffee,
                                    the men does not give us quite coffee enough to do us here.
                                    Pappy gets his own dinner, and supper and breakfast. I cook meat
                                    make coffee and good gravy and sometimes bake corn cakes, we
                                    pound our coffee in a tin instead of grinding it on a coffee
                                    mill.</p>
                        <p>never mind wait till pappy gets home and we will show mother how
                                    to cook and make gravy.</p>
                        <p>Elliott dont you think the men wanted me to go away off with my
                                    mule team through the mud and rain and cold, and there was
                                    another man went in my place and let me stay in my little house
                                    by the fire, dont you think that he was a good man for going in
                                    my place.</p>
                        <p>there is a great big river here lots wider than clear across
                                    grandmothers orchard</p>
                        <p>pappy washed his shirt and drawers today.</p>
                        <p>Elliott you must be a good boy. pappy will come home after a
                                    while.</p>

                        <p>"Tis sabbath, yes 'tis sabbath, But how little
                                    it is appreciated as sabbath here. Indeed few know that it is
                                    sabbath. The regular duties change but little for sabbath. No
                                    especial cleaning up for the Lords day No one says that we will
                                    go up to the sanctuary of the Lord today, to make prayer before
                                    the throne. No church bell ringing to invite us thither. The old
                                    clock does not stand on the mantle to tell us that the hour has
                                    come for worship. No little ones to <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-052-2-052"/> dress and put on their winter garb
                                    in order to show their little feet the way to the Lords house.
                                    None of Zions familiar songs are sung to put our minds in frame
                                    for the day, but filthy wicked songs are heard throughout the
                                    camp, profanity floats from nearly every breath. Nearly every
                                    one is doing something diverse from the honor of the Lord, or
                                    keeping his day holy. Alas! for the people of these united
                                    states! this war is raging with telling effect on their morals.
                                    I will now change the subject a little I am ceartain if I had to
                                    live here in the south, even if there was no war, and had my
                                    family with in the bargain, that I should pine away and die for
                                    want of a contented mind. The people here do not seam like
                                    people, they are shamefully ignorant, their children grow up a
                                    great deal like their horses, they are learned to help raise a
                                    little something to eat and to go to mill, and that is about
                                    all. One of their justices of the peace decided that it took 20
                                    rods and three grains, (barly corn grains he called it) to make
                                    an acre of ground when it takes 160 rod to make an acre.</p>
                        <p>I have a very nice little shanty to stay in here, and am very
                                    comfortable now but it may not last long.</p>
                        <p>For three days we have had settled cold weather., much like
                                    winter in Indiana. Oh how I would like to know where my little
                                    family is today and what they are doing, but I expect they are
                                    in the old cabin around a warm stove. My health is good except I
                                    do not feel so stout on account of having the diarrhoea by
                                    spells.</p>
                        <p>I do not expect to get entirely shut of it while I am in the
                                    service. I have to be exposed too much, and eat too much fat
                                    bacon.</p>
                        <p>Well I had but little to write when I commenced and I guess I had
                                    better quit.</p>

                        <p>I have just come back from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. I was there with the team for rations. I thought
                                    that I would write some more in this letter before I sent it, as
                                    I forgot to send it befor I left, which was four days ago.
                                    Daniel Walter was to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName> with me. we had a very cold trip of it. but got
                                    back all safe.</p>
                        <p>My health is still good.</p>
                        <p>Driving team is very hard work a little harder than I like <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-052-2-053"/> to do for 13 dollars per.
                                    month. I received a letter from you yesterday and am sorry that
                                    you are sad on account of not getting any letters from me for so
                                    long a time I could not write while we were coming from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> was the trouble. Be assured that you have my

                        <p>The talk is that we will leave here soon the company is to go on
                                    courier duty I think a few miles up the river.</p>
                        <p>It might not be out of place to tell you what a courier line is.
                                    Well ther is a courier line from Bridgeport, to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> (and further for any thing that I know.) That is,
                                    there are cavalry or mounted infantry stationed at posts within,
                                    from four to six miles of eachother, and about six men at each
                                    post, for the purpose of carrying dispatches or letters from one
                                    place to another. For instance, suppose that a dispach is to go
                                    from Bridgport to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. the first courier post sends it to the next post,
                                    that post sends it to the next and so on untill it gets to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. You will excuse me for writing nothing very
                                    important, as there is nothing of that kind to write.</p>
                        <p>Let me know whether you find any thing in this letter. </p>

                        <p>Yours of the 28th. <hi rend="i">ult.</hi> came yesterday, a most
                                    welcome visitor indeed, and, as does all of your letters, it
                                    rendered me no small amount of satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>You spoke of time passing unenjoyed. Now I cannot say that I
                                    enjoy the time as it passes, yet I am not down hearted, time
                                    passes swiftly here, a day seemingly, but appears untill it is
                                    gone. If no misfortune befalls us, and I get out of the service
                                    next fall, it will not be long until that time comes. Whether I
                                    will have to stay three years or not I can not tell. If I do
                                    have to stay we will have to take it as easy as possible, for it
                                    will be only a little over a year after the <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-052-2-054"/> ballance are out. my time counts
                                    from the 12th. of last <hi rend="i">Oct.</hi> one yeare ago. but
                                    I think that I will not have to stay three years. You speak of
                                    some getting scart about the draft. Well they need not be scart,
                                    for they are no better than the ballance of us. and are just as

                                    from 5 to 10 cents a peice. besides there are a number of other
                                    papers come around, but not so regular. The boys that were out
                                    on the scout have had some pretty tight skirmishing a few have
                                    been taken prisoners. We have commenced moving camp to Ringold,
                                    a distance of about ten miles, only part of our wagons were here
                                    and they could not take all of the camp equipage, so some of us
                                    are here yet waiting for the waggons to come back to haul the
                                    ballance of the things.</p>
                        <p>The weather here is nice except it look some like rain just now.
                                    I am having a nice time now probably the main reason is that I
                                    am enjoying better health now than I have for more than six
                                    month past. I have just cooked a pot of beans for supper, which
                                    would not eat so bad even at home. This war is makeing a great
                                    many good cooks, quite a number of the boys can bake just as

                        <p>I have just received two letters from you. The first dated March
                                    2 which contained a needle and one of Elliott's teeth.
                                    Oh it done me good, simple as it was.</p>
                        <p>We are now at camp at Ringgold <placeName>

                                    Chickamauga Creek. The veterans are to start home next Sunday,
                                    and it is said that then the ballance of us will move to some
                                    other place. The veterans <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-052-2-055"/>
                                    so that it will not run. If you wish, and have money enough you
                                    may send it off and get it fixed, it will cost about
                                    $2.50. It has been quite cold here for a couple days.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Amanda—.</salute>
                        <p>This is Sabbath, and is very pleasant excepting there are some
                                    appearances of rain. We are not yet paid, but will be today or
                                    tomorrow I will tell you in this letter what I did not like to
                                    in my other ones When I got to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> I found that some one had taken all my blankets I
                                    had one gum, and two woolen blankets. So I had to sleep without
                                    any blankets untill last night. We drew new ones yesterday. I
                                    would have told you this in my first letter but I did not want
                                    you to know it untill I was better off. I am well and cheerful
                                    so far as the surrounding circumstances can make me But it would
                                    be the most extreeme vainty for me to try to fill up that empty
                                    void in my heart, caused by the absence of my family, with
                                    earth's brightest pleasures, or her most lovely
                                    objects.</p>
                        <p>All those things which engage the attention of the mirthful
                                    around me, are to me but vain and empty things.</p>
                        <p>My comfort is derived from the religion which I enjoy, and the
                                    comfortable hope which I entertain of shortly realizing my
                                    hearts best wishes,—the enjoyments of my family and
                                    friends.</p>

                        <p>Well Amanda We are in camp abut two and a half miles south of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, in a very nice open piece of woods. The weather is
                                    quite warm through the day, but cool at night, peaches are as
                                    large as a full grown plumb, every green and nice. I have washed
                                    up nice and blackened my boots, and now my heart's best
                                    joys would be complete, if I could by your side, and in company
                                    with our little girl and boy walk to the house of the Lord and
                                    spend a season in praising his great name. I expect we will stay
                                    here untill we get horses, but how that will be I cannot tell.</p>
                        <p>My health and the health of the reg't is very good. I am
                                    buncking with S. Hilton, D. Towle, and Henry Barbar.</p>
                        <p>I have not received a letter from you since I came back, but I am
                                    looking for one every day. for I know that you will not forget
                                    me … I will close expecting soon to hear from you</p>

                        <p>I have just been relieved from picket guard, after having been on
                                    for two nights and nearly two days.</p>
                        <p>The weather is very pleasant here now, it having rained a few
                                    small Showers and thereby made the weather a little cooler
                                    through the day</p>
                        <p>I forgot to say in the connection that our reg't has to
                                    furnish guards for picket all around the city of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, besides two out of each company for to guard the
                                    trains of cars going to different points from here, neither one
                                    is very hard, at least on picket there is no danger of rebels
                                    and each one only has to stand two hours in twelve. The prospect
                                    seams good to stay here a while, but orders may come to leave
                                    any day.</p>

                        <p>I am seated this morning to write you a few lines. We are all
                                    tore up All the reg't has gone but the sick and the two
                                    new companies (L. &amp; M.) Our Co is all gone but a few. I
                                    was on guard in town and they went off and left me. I am glad to
                                    tell you that I am well again.</p>
                        <p>It is very warm here yet.</p>
                        <p>It is supposed that the reg't has gone to Decature <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. They went on the cars without horses, no one knows
                                    what the object is. It seams awful lonesome since the boys are
                                    gone Serg't Bosworth is with us. D Towle is still
                                    getting better but he is not able to be out of the Hospittle
                                    yet.</p>
                        <p>… I have to start to go where the reg't has
                                    gone in a few minutes. …</p>

                        <p>I am seated this morning again to give you a little different
                                    information from what I gave you yesterday. I started yesterday
                                    morning as I told you I would after some bundleing and fixing up
                                    I had a pretty good load to carry I assure you. I got pretty
                                    neart to the depot when I met H. Blowers, and he told me that
                                    they were all gone, and that I need go no further so I came back
                                    to camp, but the joke is as I came back I got into an orchard
                                    and got three apples, in which I thought there was no harm, and
                                    which I had done more than once before. There was a camp of
                                    hundred days men about 200 yards from there and as I started on
                                    to camp here came one of them with his gun and bayonet hollowing
                                    halt to me I was surprised, I halted and went to him he said he
                                    had orders to take me to his Colonel. Well I went with him to
                                    the Colonel and the Colonel set me at liberty, and I came on to
                                    camp.</p>
                        <p>This is a beautiful morning but it is lonesome here. My health is
                                    very good now. Papere is scarce and I have to write half sheets.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Wife—.</salute>
                        <p>I think it would be much better for you if you would get the Idea
                                    of hospitle nurse out of your head While that preacher and his
                                    wife was here that I have allready told you about, she was
                                    around the chaplains tent a goodeal and, and the boys would talk
                                    about her and the chaplain wheather there was any cause or not,
                                    but the way the chaplain has conducted himself heretofore, one
                                    can not tell what may have been done.</p>
                        <p>It seams to be my luck to wait on the sick. I have been waiting
                                    on J. Miller for a week now, he bunks with me, and is a great
                                    deal better now.</p>
                        <p>Dear Amanda. I expect we will not be paid off now for two months
                                    more but when we do get pay it will be a little more than common
                                    we will get 16 dollars per month instead of 13. If I am
                                    discharged with the reg't I do not expect any more pay
                                    until I am discharged. I have just picked a fine lot of
                                    blackberries. My health is excellent and I hope this will find
                                    you all well. I am as ever your true Husband.</p>

                                    then it would not start out till tomorrow. My health was hardly
                                    ever better than it is now. My appetite is too craving. I can
                                    eat untill I am in misery, and then my <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-052-2-060"/> appetite craves for more. This is
                                    the first morning for a week that I have not went to hunt
                                    blackberries. I am out of sugar, is the reason, but we will draw
                                    again tomorrow. It just take a whole cabbage head to make me a
                                    mess now let me know how your wheat is holding out, if it is
                                    likely to fail soon I must write to pap to let you have some
                                    wheat.</p>

                                    </placeName>, with Sherman. It is very dry here. Rosting ears
                                    are plenty but they do us but little good, for we have no money
                                    to buy, and we dare not take them without buying, some are got
                                    however by the process of stealing. The same may be said of
                                    apples and potatoes.</p>

                        <salute>Dearest One—.</salute>
                        <p>I am in receipt, of a most welcome and interesting letter, from
                                    you. dated just one week ago. Such a letter amounts to an
                                    extreem satisfaction for me. I am sorry to hear of your garden
                                    being so missused, and torn up. I can call the leaving of the
                                    fence down, nothing but extreem carelessness. I wish I had got
                                    that middle fence built before I came away. Next are the letters
                                    from the hands of my little dear ones, though they do not speak
                                    a do other letters, yet they are more significant than words,
                                        <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-052-2-061"/> Tell my little ones
                                    that papy often thinks of them, and often dreams of them in his
                                    sleep. Tell them that I have a nice bed, it is boards with hay
                                    on them, instead of a straw-tic.</p>
                        <p>Amanda I am sorry that I cannot get you to understand by hints
                                    that the Hospital is no place for you, but I shall be still more
                                    sorry if I shall have to use harsh word to get you out of the
                                    notion of nursing in the hospital. I speak this way because I
                                    know of them, and you dont. If you knew as much of hospitals as
                                    I do, you would never once think of being a nurse. I hope you
                                    will be satisfied on that point when you read this.</p>
                        <p>You say the home guards are going to have a dinner in
                                    Westchester. What have they ever done that they deserve a public
                                    dinner. The home guards and their exploits are one of the
                                    things, that the soldiers in the field, make sport over, and
                                    laugh about. What! make dinners for home guards, when a soldier
                                    who has spent his time in front fighting the enemy face to face,
                                    comes home on furlough, has to trudge back and forth through the
                                    mud on foot, and no one offers him assistance, but it may be
                                    that folks at home, have fell in love with the home guards,
                                    being continually with! the P<hi rend="sc">RECIOUS</hi> F<hi rend="sc">ELLOWS</hi>!</p>
                        <p>My health is excelent, no news of importance. All are well that
                                    you you are acquainted with. I have got my Jacob Miller about
                                    well. He says that he went to school to liber the same time you
                                    did.</p>
                        <p>Potatoes, Aples, Cabbage, corn, and Water melons are brought into
                                    use by the boys here, by the strategic move move of stealing. I
                                    close most earnestly praying for your good, and assureing you of
                                    the constant love of your.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Wife—.</salute>
                        <p>I am seated to reply to yours of the 27 ult. While you are glad
                                    of my good health, it is also a matter of no little satisfaction
                                    to me. You ceartainly have a very correct idea of the hapy
                                    meeting of <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                                    </placeName> and his wife after an absence of three days. Poor
                                    folks I expect that their hearts were allmost broken over the
                                    fearful length of their separation. Dear Amanda, it does hurt me
                                    to know that you have <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-052-2-062"/> to
                                    work so hard. It seams like an abuse of your good nature, and if
                                    I had any grounds to go on, I would scould you a little. You say
                                    that your health is tollerable. but I fear that your courage is
                                    all that keeps you going. Oh how much better I would feel if
                                    your circumstances were so that you need not work out of the
                                    house. …</p>
                        <p>We are in the same camp, without any changes particularly, the
                                    health of the boys that are here is pretty good. We have been
                                    having very heavy rains here, well the corporal says that it is
                                    time for me to go on guard, it is only to guard the well here in
                                    camp to keep the boys from making the water dirty</p>
                        <p>I am off guard again, and am seated to finish my letter.</p>
                        <p>Amanda it is hardly any use to send me thes little envelopes; it
                                    is very unhandy doing up a sheet of paper to go in them. I can
                                    get plenty of envelopes while I am here.</p>
                        <p>While I am writing, there is a young man scarcely 21, at the
                                    sutler shop so drunk as hardly to be able to stand on his feet:
                                    but this is only one instance of the many, which is almost a
                                    daily occurance here.</p>
                        <p>This leaves me in excelent health, I hope it may find you the
                                    same.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Companion—.</salute>
                        <p>The time has again come, to write you a letter. I aim to write
                                    every sunday, and once through the week. This is thursday. I
                                    spoke in my last of the reported capture of the reg't.
                                    It turnes out however not a capture but a severe raid, had it
                                    not been for the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                                    </placeName> rifles I suppose they would have been captured.
                                    They were entirely surrounded by a heavy force, and had to cut
                                    their way out. There were some other regiments that threw away
                                    their guns, and were so confused that they scarcely knew what
                                    they were doing, and when they found that our reg't
                                    were going out, they fell in behind, and come out with them.
                                    There were about 1500 came out at that time, none had guns but
                                    our <hi rend="i">reg't.</hi> and there were only about
                                    four or five hundred of them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="i">Col.</hi> Harrison, was captured, but he is reported
                                    upon good authority in our lines again we have have not learnt
                                    how he got back.</p>

                        <p>An order has come to the reg't settling the matter that
                                    the recruits will have to stay three years, It is possible that
                                    Congress will do something for us hereafter, but not <hi rend="i">probable.</hi> Well if the Lord spares me to get
                                    out of the service which will only be a little over a year more
                                    any how. they will never get me into it again. Gov Morton is
                                    trying to get as many of the soldiers home to vote as he can,
                                    but if he should get me home I would not vote for him, for he is
                                    the man that got me into this, and now him and the men that are
                                    running the government are practicing this fraud on us, It is
                                    nothing less than defrauding the recruits out of, some one, and
                                    some two years time. It would be no worse to defraud a man out
                                    of so much money, which would be a crime in civil law, yet the
                                    government calling itself the best the sun ever shone on is
                                    practicing just such a crime on thousands of Soldiers, and they
                                    cannot help them selves. It is enough to tempt one to be a
                                    butternut, but Dear wife we will have to bear it, but I will
                                    never go in the service again if I have to leave home till the
                                    war is over to keep rid of the draft.</p>
                        <p>And I am going to play out of duty whenever I can if I have to go
                                    in the guard house for it.</p>
                        <p>It makes me mad to think of it. I was drafted only for nine
                                    months, but thought that I would do even more for the government
                                    than it asked of me, and therefore enlisted for nearly two
                                    years, and they fraudulently put it down on the muster rolls 3
                                    years, as they did all other recruits, and now they say they
                                    cannot discharge us because the muster rolls are for three
                                    years. We have to grin and bear it just because the fraud was
                                    practiced by the leading men of the nation and we underlings are
                                    to be the tools with which they are to work out for them selves
                                    a great name in the world, do you not think I am out of humor?
                                    Amanda do not read what I said about it to any one.</p>
                        <p>I forgot to say that my health is very good.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Companion—.</salute>
                        <p>I thought I would commence a letter today and finish it tomorrow.
                                    You will notice by the heading of this letter that we have moved
                                    since I last wrote. The above named camp which we are now in is
                                    situated on the Cumberland river, two <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-052-2-064"/> or three miles from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. It is on a hill, and a nice place to camp, only it
                                    is a little hard carrying water up the hill.</p>
                        <p>It is now Sunday morning, but what is best yesterday's
                                    mail brought me a letter from you, dated the 15th inst. You
                                    speak of its being very dry there we have had rain nearly every
                                    day this month here. There are some things about Harrisons
                                    enlisting that look queare. He will enlist for one year if they
                                    can raise a company, that is if he can be captain of that
                                    company, I suppose. You say that none of his company enlisted,
                                    that seams to speak against him. Him being a soldier once for a
                                    year, and half of that time at home, has sort of played out. It
                                    is generally thought here that he played off to get a discharge,
                                    and you know whether he did or not, and so do I.</p>
                        <p>You next speak of the nights of the golden circle resisting the
                                    draft, so far as contentions are concerned, I expect one is
                                    better off down here than at home, for here every thing goes one
                                    way, but dont understand that I had rather be here than at home
                                    with you.</p>
                        <p>Sunday as it is, we are ordered to cut down the weeds and sprouts
                                    and to make a general cleaning up about our quarters. Well this
                                    is only a little thing and only one of the many little things
                                    done in the army, which ceartainly is wicked, now is it any
                                    wonder that this dreadful war is allowed to be prolonged as it
                                    is. Amanda I always was in favor of the administration and the
                                    war, and am yet, but there is a great evil right at the heart of
                                    the whole thing, that evil is, the war is carried on and led,
                                    principally by wicked and God dareing men. Indeed when we
                                    consider that war within itself is wicked, and the awful henious
                                    wickedness, of the army, we must conclude that it is only the
                                    amazeing and unlimited mercy of God, in favor of right, that
                                    will give us victory over our enemies.</p>
                        <p>Towle and Barber is still puny. Barber has gone to the hospitle
                                    at town, The boys say when Jackson took barber as a recruit that
                                    he robbed the grave yeard. sometimes they call him a living
                                    grave yard. Towl looks like a walking skeleton. They eat a great
                                    deal of green corn and apples and any thing else they can get.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Wife—.</salute>
                        <p>I was down to the city today to negro Sunday school. There were
                                    nearly 400 darkies there. All seeme to be interested in the
                                    school. I next went to one of the fashionable churches of the
                                    city, and heard portion of a lifeless sermon, it was a
                                    magnifficent house, with a grand pulpit, splendid walls and
                                    cushioned seats.</p>
                        <p>This is the 29th. I felt so little like writing yesterday that I
                                    put off writing till today. I am on guard at the head quarters
                                    of this camp, with 17 others of our reg't. We are
                                    likely to stay here on guard as long as the reg't stays
                                    about <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. We are quartered in the guard house, and have a
                                    very nice place to stay, much better than in a tent. We are on
                                    guard every-other day, and do not have to stand at night at all.
                                    some of our squad goes out into the country every day to pick up
                                    soldiers who are in mischief, and while we are out, we get all
                                    the apples and peaches that we can eat.</p>
                        <p>I was out this forenoon and brought in a few very nice apples and
                                    cooked them for dinner.</p>
                        <p>This is the 30th and it is a shame that I should be so long
                                    writing this letter, so I will try to close it now.</p>
                        <p>This is a beautiful morning. I have just had my breakfast, and am
                                    well and hearty. If I just knew that your health was good I
                                    would be much happier.</p>
                        <p>It may be that we will remain a permanent detail here, if the
                                    ballance of the reg't does leave. I will stay if I can.
                                    But this is only a supposition of my own.</p>

                        <p>I am sorry that your condition is such, that you have to be both
                                    man and wife, to dig and toil, untill I fear you will be broke
                                    down, and bear marks of age, though young. Dear Amanda I wish it
                                    could be otherwise, but the dark threatening future seems to
                                    forbid a hope for better things, for a <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-052-2-066"/> time. Who can know what those dark
                                    freaks, in the political heavens in the north, portend.</p>
                        <p>Your request to send you some old cloths, is beyond my power at
                                    present to perform. You ought to make up my infantry overcoat,
                                    into cloths for Elliott. The rebel <hi rend="i">Gen.</hi>
                                    Wheeler is making some show between here and Murfreesboro, with
                                    a few thousand cavalry. They have been fighting with him last
                                    night and this morning, no telling what it will amount to yet.</p>
                        <p>I told you in my last that I was on guard at the headquarters of
                                    this camp. How long I will stay here I cannot tell but I will
                                    stay here just as long as they will let me.</p>
                        <p>We have our victuals cooked for us now, we have a very good cook.
                                    We have a very nice thing of it here.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Companion—.</salute>
                        <p>I received yours of the 27th <hi rend="i">ult.</hi> yesterday. It
                                    is truly a great satisfaction to learn that you are well again.
                                    And now if I only had it in my power to send you what money you
                                    need how much happier I would be. I do not know when we will
                                    draw any money, for most of our boys that were here, have gone
                                    out after Wheeler, and the main part of them is in the front. I
                                    expect you had better get some money of <placeName>

                        <p>You speak of the reg't coming to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to muster out the non-veterans. Now let me tell you
                                    that any persons, who may be feeding themselves on that notion,
                                    is sucking at a dry <hi rend="i">tit.</hi> Such a thing as the
                                    reg't coming home to vote may be, and only may be.
                                    Sirus Hanley need not hitch up to go yet for a few days.</p>
                        <p>Well J. Miller and I are now in the cook tent, that is we are
                                    cooking for our squad, 19 in number, that are doing provost duty
                                    here at head quarters, We have just had breakfast, and washed
                                    the dishes, and feel as comfortable as we can under the
                                    circumstances. We have good news again, John Morgan is killed
                                    his staff captured, with a number of his men.</p>
                        <p>The war seems to be progressing finely, and if it does not run in
                                    the ground too soon, it will find its point of destination in
                                    the gulf of Mexico, or the Atlantic Ocean,</p>
                        <p>If I can get to stay here I shall be pretty well satisfied,
                                    especially if I can heare once in a while that you are well at
                                    home, and have plenty to eat. Well dear Wife it does appear that
                                    the Lord intends to favor us I know that he has favored me since
                                    I have been in the service. When the reg't went to the
                                    front some time ago it hapened that I was at town on duty, is
                                    all that saved me from going with them, and it was the first
                                    that I had been from camp, for two weeks before that. It is very
                                    likely that I would have had to go with the boys after Wheeler
                                    if I had not have been here at head quarters.</p>
                        <p>I firmly believe that the Lord is laying out a work for me to do,
                                    and that it was necessary to give me a lesson of three years
                                    from my family, in the army, first probably to learn me to love
                                    my family, and second to learn me human nature, for no better
                                    chance is afforded one, than in the army to learn human nature
                                    It seams that I never felt such a fullness of soul to be about
                                    my masters business as I now do.</p>
                        <p>I have the best of health, and pray that the blessing may be
                                    yours also.</p>

                        <p>I received a letter from Abe a few days ago. he wants to come
                                    home to vote for Lincoln and Morton. He says that pap wrote to
                                    him that he hoped that the people of the north would not resist
                                    the draft. Abe thinks that is a sign that pap is getting over
                                    his copperhead democracy</p>

                        <salute>Dear Wife—.</salute>
                        <p>I have just returned from the raid, have only been here long
                                    enough to unsaddle my horse and wash myself. I find three
                                    letters here from you and cannot wait longer to answer them. We
                                    have been on the raid just 20 days, and in all that time had not
                                    a chance to write to you. I know that you will be very anxious
                                    about me until you get this letter. I stood the raid very well,
                                    was not sick at all. but several of the boys took sick and had
                                    to be sent back. We fought the reb's nearly one whole
                                    day. had several horses killed and about 30 men killed and
                                    wounded.</p>
                        <p>I heard the song of several bulletts, and the ugly buzing of of a
                                    few shells while I was on the raid.</p>
                        <p>Sunday morning 16th. I thought I would write a few more words
                                    this morning. I have just got done washing my cloths, you may
                                    think it strange that I should wash on Sunday. My cloth was so
                                    dirty and lousy that I could not wait till another day. I had to
                                    borrow cloths to put on, till mine gets dry. This is a beautiful
                                    Sabbath I am well and hearty, and would be tollerably contented,
                                    if I could only know that my little family was well and doing
                                    well I must close and mail my letter</p>

                        <p>I received yours of the 11th. inst. yesterday. I am sad, and how
                                    can I help it. To know your condition makes me sad. <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-052-2-070"/> While I write I can allmost see you
                                    and the children suffering with acheing heads and fevered forms,
                                    with scarcely any one to ask you how you feel. This is hard,
                                    these are some of lifes heaviest sorrows, and darkest billows.
                                    Oh the wreched cruelties of this war! Who can estimate them.
                                    Look at the tears of the orphan! hear the deep lamentation and
                                    groans of the innumerable sufferers, Mark the depressed
                                    countenance of the widow, which speaks in sorrows language the
                                    deep, keen anguish of a broken heart; and then tell how cruil
                                    war is.</p>
                        <p>Was there any just cause for war, there might be an excuse for
                                    its cruelties, But when we remember that it is all to satisfy
                                    the wicked and fiendish ambition of man, it then assumes the
                                    horrible nature, next to the dredful realities of eternal
                                    despair. Great God when will this dredful calamity end. When
                                    will the sacrifice of blood and tears, and groans, atone for the
                                    sin of the nation, and restore thy smiles. … I would
                                    liked very much to have went home to vote, but that has played
                                    out. so that we may rest easy on that score. The order is now
                                    that we start to the reg't tomorrow morning, I will
                                    write again the next opporunity. I am well and hearty. I am as

                        <salute>Dear Companion.</salute>
                        <p>After 11 days unavoidable delay I seat myself to write you a few
                                    lines. We left <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> the 20 inst, and arrived here yesterday Although we
                                    traveled ten days we only made 150 miles.</p>
                        <p>We are now awaiting orders, we may leave tomorrow morning, and we
                                    may not leave for a week. We have just drawn five days rations,
                                    my breakfast consisted, this morning of coffee sugar and parched
                                    corn.</p>
                        <p>I expect that we will go to the reg't. from here. We do
                                    not know just where the regt. is now.</p>
                        <p>There are a great many rumors about the rebel army. It is said
                                    that the rebel army is divided, and one part is coming in
                                    northwest of here on the Tenn. river, again report says that our
                                    forces down there have whipped him, or the rebs and are driveing
                                    them a northwest direction. I suppose that there is something of
                                    it, for the fourth army corpse that just <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-052-2-071"/> passed through here on their way
                                    down that direction. The weather is very nice here now, it is
                                    warm today and has the appearance of rain. My health is
                                    excellent at this time, and has been all summer and fall, and
                                    what is some comfort, is that every day that passes now is
                                    wearing away the last year in the service for me, and the next
                                    time they get me to enlist in an old reg't for the
                                    unexpired time, will be the second time, which will never be
                                    untill this government comes up to its promises. Whether that
                                    time will ever come or not is only known by the <hi rend="i">All

                        <p>I tell you Amanda whenever I get to thinking how they lied to me
                                    to get me in the service for three years, I feel vexed, yes I
                                    get mad. I love the government but such a gulling operation
                                    makes one nearly hate it. Dear Wife pardon me for writing

                        <p>We have communications with our fleet and get provision in that

                        <p>We had a long trip down here, and a very pleasant one except that
                                    we had to shoot a few times at the rebs. We always had plenty of
                                    fresh meet and ham, and honey and butter when we could get it,
                                    and sweet potatoes without end. and chickens much the same. It
                                    have been the richest time in the service for me. We burned
                                    cotton enough, to nearly buy the state of Indiana.</p>
                        <p>It was rich to se the negros flock to the road to see us pass.
                                    and still richer to see the boys make them pull off their hats
                                    and coats and dance while we were passing.</p>
                        <p>If you want an Idea of the face of this country just think of the

                                    a few days that it froze some It is quite pleasant to go in our

                        <salute>Dear Wife—.</salute>
                        <p>Well we have moved camp again about ten miles nearer Savannah. I
                                    was in Savannah yesterday. It is quite a large place but
                                    awkwardly built. I took a look over into <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                                    </placeName> but have not been there yet. Savannah is a strongly
                                    fortified place, but a few nights ago the rebels left about
                                    ninety siege guns and a great many small canon in their works,
                                    and crossed the river into <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, bound, it is supposed, for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                                    </placeName> in all possible haste: but Sherman was awake and at
                                    their heels, and has taken a number of prisoners.</p>
                        <p>We have had a few days of right cool weather, cold enough to
                                    freeze ice, but it is now right pleasant again.</p>
                        <p>My health is good, it certainly never was better.</p>
                        <p>You have the best wishes and ardent love of your unworthy
                                    Husband.</p>

                        <salute> Dear Companion—</salute>
                        <p>It has been over one week since I wrote you last. I generally
                                    made it a rule to write to you twice a week, but there is
                                    nothing here now to write about, and paper costs three cents a
                                    sheet and envelopes about the same; and scarce at that,
                                    therefore I do not write so often.</p>
                        <p>We get but very little mail here the last letter I got from you
                                    was written on the 20th day of last November. It is a sad thing
                                    to be so long without hearing from you. but I am in hopes that
                                    all things are going well with you. …</p>
                        <p>Would you think that a soldier in the army loved his wife at
                                    home, if he had undue communication with negro wenches down
                                    here? Such is positively the case in this Company. …</p>
                        <p>I was at Savannah yesterday yesterday on General review; The
                                    military meaning of review is for the commanding General to see
                                    wheather his troups are in good fighting trim. It may be useful
                                    to an army but I <hi rend="i">can't see it.</hi>

                        <salute>Dear Wife—</salute>
                        <p>Amanda my heart aches when I look over the dreadful picture which
                                    the army presents. I am most heartily sick of this kind of life.
                                    Oh what a pleasant retreete from the repulsive, scenes of this
                                    man slaughtering life, would be the society of my family in some
                                    secluded spot, shut out from the calamities of war.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that I am in the midst of a great Ocean, whose mad
                                    billows roll around and beneath, while the heavens are hid by
                                    dark and frightful clouds, which hurl their black massive forms
                                    in confusion through the air; and forked lightenings flash,
                                    streaming through and lighting up the convulsed mass of nature,
                                    only to make it look more horifying. In this state of terific
                                    horror I look out byond the fierce commotion of the elements,
                                    and my eye catches a sight, that for the time being, causes me
                                    to forget all that is around me. It is three bright loving forms
                                    in their little quiet home, longing for the storm to subside and
                                    the return of a husband and father. Will they hear me if I
                                    hollow to them that I am coming. Dear wife I am coming, nine
                                    months from today will release me from the army, and then I am
                                    coming to stay with you.</p>
                        <p>The weather has turned out very wet for two or three days past,
                                    and it is quite mudy and nasty getting about.</p>
                        <p>We are to leave here in a short time but I know not just how
                                    soon, and I do not know where we are going some think that we
                                    are going further north.</p>
                        <p>It is strange that I get not letters from you; I cannot make
                                    myself believe that you have not written, and if you have why do
                                    they not come. Is my wife lying sick unable to write or is she
                                    gone to the better land, or has she forgotten me. such
                                    reflections harrass my mind. I will wait patiently to know the
                                    truth of it all. let you be where you may, my heart still
                                    lingers there. I cannot forget you. Oh may God pitty and
                                    preserve us and grant us, a happy meeting soon, is the prayre of
                                    your Husband.</p>

                        <p>Two days ago I wrote you a hasty letter, today I have the
                                    privilege of writing another. We have been marching since the
                                    25th. of Jan. and are not through yet. I do not know where we
                                    will go to from here. We have had but little fighting on this
                                    trip. The rebel cavalry have been watching us very close, we
                                    have marched side by side with them nearly all the time, but
                                    they have not seamed anxious to fight, neither have we. We have
                                    nice weather now, but we have had very disagreeable weather. Our
                                    march over the country has been like the blighting pestilence,
                                    for we have taken or turned upsidedown every thing before us. I
                                    have a great many things in store to tell you. …</p>

                        <p>Another Sabbath has come. … I look just without the
                                    tent and see a half dozen or more, running, bending, and
                                    jabbering over a game of marble. And just a little further over
                                    four more are in a sitting posture, breathing out threats, and
                                    heinous oaths over a game of cards. While in different parts of
                                    camp may be found those, who after a night of drunken revelry,
                                    at houses of ill fame, feel much like the domestic <hi rend="i">curr</hi> which has been whiped and beaten home and is
                                    lying in some corner, to allow nature to repare the bruises
                                    received in some infamous haunt. …</p>
                        <p>This is a beautiful day. we are having very nice weather for corn
                                    planting. The wounded of our company are doing very well. I saw
                                    Basset [?] yesterday his arm will get well as soon as such a
                                    wound can.</p>
                        <p>Andrew Jackson is commanding our company, he is a splendid
                                    officer Such men as him will be loved when we all get home, he
                                    is going to see Harrison some of these days and he says that I
                                    may go with him.</p>
                        <p>We have plenty to eat here. We have considerable duty to do but
                                    not hard duty. We have nice plank houses and nice weather, so
                                    that if soldiering is pleasant at all, it is pleasant here. But
                                    then I never saw any thing nice about soldiering.</p>

                                    every day, so that you will not be so uneasy about me as you
                                    was.</p>
                        <p>Well I must close and go to the telegraph office.</p>

                        <p>I am seated with yours of the 16th. ult. [?] before me,
                                    attempting to answer it.</p>
                        <p>You state that your health is not so good I am thankful however
                                    that it is nothing worse than a cold. I deeply regret that you
                                    have to expose yourself as you do. but it seams that there is no
                                    help at present. I expect to return this fall, and I hope to be
                                    able to help you soon, save your self all you can. As you say,
                                    the death of Mr. Lincoln is a sad affair to the nation, but it
                                    is still worse for the rebels and the infamous wretches who
                                    plotted his death; for it leaves in his stead a man who will
                                    deal out to them the stern realities of the law.</p>

                        <p>A man who will punish treason, and not pardon it, who will hang

                        <p>You say you were weaving. Now I do not want you to do much of
                                    that for it is a woman killing business.</p>
                        <p>You speak of Heviland wanting to take things out of the shop. I
                                    will mash his head for him when I come home if he goes to
                                    figuring so fresh [?] around there while I am gone. Tell him or
                                    read this to him, that if he takes a single brick out of that
                                    chimney, that it will be a dear brick to him.</p>
                        <p>I wonder if he thinks that I am going to serve in the army for
                                    three years, as much for his good as mine, while he is at home
                                    to make a living for his family, while mine has to rake and
                                    scrape for themselves, and then allow him to take my wifes
                                    property, and run over her because she is a woman, and cant help
                                    it, <hi rend="i">never!</hi> while I have the muscular strength
                                    that I have now, let him or any other man try it, and I will
                                    prepare him for a place where they wont need blacksmiths, or
                                    brick either. I want it understood that the man is not well off,
                                    who insults you while I am gone.</p>
                        <p>If he wants the work bench or tool rack and will make a fuss if
                                    he does not get them, let him take them, but them brick in that
                                    chimney must be left there, why he had as well want the shingles
                                    off the roof, or the weatherboarding, as the chimney. You bought
                                    every thing but his tools, and his tools is all that he has a
                                    right to. I wish I was there I would settle it with him.</p>

                                    yesterday. The first was written while you was at Hank

                                    meeting. I am rejoiced at the glowing account you give of the

                                    becoming religious. I suppose that Hank is sailing high, but I
                                    cannot suppress my doubts, for no one can trust a horse that has
                                    been in the habit of running away, But I am <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-052-2-078"/> surprised when you tell me that
                                    Jessee McCollum has come back to Jay. That beautiful <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                                    </placeName> is played out.</p>
                        <p>You state that Elista weighs 44 pounds. I guess that is heavy
                                    enough for a girl four years old. but her pappy weighs some
                                    more. I weigh 182. pounds, and certainly am as healthy as I ever
                                    was.</p>
                        <p>H. Finkbone says if I will write to him he will answer me. Well
                                    he will not have to write any answers. If I had no one to write
                                    to but him, I would not write any. You may think this is pretty
                                    rough to write about my cousin, but how did he talk to me when I
                                    was at home. I will not forget that soon. If he ever talks to me
                                    that way again I would rather mash his pretty face, than to
                                    write to him. A man cannot be a butternut and a Christian too.
                                    The war is over now. and the rebels badly whipped, something
                                    that the butternuts said could not be done, and now I expect
                                    that the lying scoundrells will say that they were allways good
                                    union men. I know of several here who were hard rebels, who are
                                    now fixing to go north to live, and I will venture that they
                                    will deny ever being southern men <hi rend="i">at all.</hi>

                                    perfectly astonished! he had never seen such sights, he declared
                                    that there were so many nice things that he did not know what to
                                    buy first.</p>
                        <p>Amanda no mans heart ever loved a woman more than my heart loves
                                    now. but when I turn my thought to the Fink-bones and some who
                                    call me <hi rend="i">cousin</hi>, I look on them as mean
                                    sneaking rebels, for while I have been in the army trying to
                                    build up the government, they have stayed at home, trying to
                                    tear it down. It makes me mad I do not want anything to do with
                                    them. I expect some of them are now secretly rejoicing that
                                    President Lincoln was killed. I thought that I would never fight
                                    a man under any circumstances, but I never want to be tempted by
                                    any one speaking disrespectful of Lincoln. A better man never
                                    lived on earth than Abraham Lincoln, and I will never hear him
                                    abused. And such is the resolution of the soldiers allmost to a
                                    man.</p>
                        <p>Money would be a poor remuneration for what I have endured here
                                    in the army, but having restored peace and set liberty for my
                                    children, liberty for all, on a firm foundation! the society of
                                    my Wife and children with their ardent love, will be full
                                    satisfaction. You say that the woods are so nice, well we will
                                    take many a ramble in the woods yet: be patient I am coming
                                    after a while.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Wife—.</salute>
                        <p>I was awakened this morning by the unwelcome peals of belching
                                    cannon, as they were devoting their coarse melody to the honor
                                    of the independace of this great nation. This day very naturally
                                    directs our minds back to the day when, the representatives in
                                    congress assembled, called into being that most noble document;
                                        <hi rend="i">The declaration of Independance</hi> Doubtless
                                    our revolutionary Fathers little thought that, that very same
                                    document would be to maintain by a most fearful and gigantic
                                    war, at no later day than this. Many hearts, this day, in the
                                    citties and towns of the north, will beat with heroic pride,
                                    while many more will swell with patriotic joy. But alas for poor
                                    me, the day has a vastly different meaning; and produces a
                                    vastly different effect upon my heart. While to some it will be
                                    all joy, and in recounting the blessings which attach to it,
                                    they will be jubilant and hapy; to me it is a sad memorial of
                                    wrongs, of privations, of afflictions of mind allmost
                                    unedurable.</p>
                        <p>Those who have stayed at home with their wives, and children and,
                                    friends, may well rejoice on independence day, because they have
                                    suffered no loss. But the very same service which I performed
                                    for their good, to secure their liberties, has resulted in my
                                    inestimable loss, the loss of my wifes health, if not her dear
                                    life. My very time and service for the last three years enabled
                                    those men to stay at home and take care <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-052-2-080"/> of their wives and children, and to
                                    make money while not only I myself have been endureing
                                    heardships, and exposing myself to dangers; and death: but my
                                    wife, the companion of my bosom, the one nearest of all to my
                                    heart; has had to battle alone with grim <hi rend="i">toil</hi>
                                    and waisting <hi rend="i">care.</hi> And now my return will be,
                                    not to a companion flushing in health and vigor, but to a
                                    faithful and true wife, who to show that faithfulness in my
                                    absence, has well nigh worn out her life. Dear Amanda, these
                                    reflections are as unendurable as theyare true. My heart
                                    reccedes from the scene, overwhelmed, and subdued with sorrow. I
                                    would yield to despair, if God had not said, that all things
                                    shall work togather for good to them that love God. If a glory
                                    as bright, as overwhelming, shall be given us at the close of
                                    our disasters, as our disasters have been sad and fearful, to
                                    what a world of glory and grandure we must be tending. I say if,
                                    when this storm is over, our joys shall be as complete, as our
                                    sorrows have been depressive, what unfathomable delights, and
                                    immeasureable bliss must await us. Well God has said that eye
                                    hath not seen neither hath it entered into the heart of man to
                                    conceive, what is in reserve for the faithful.</p>
                        <p>This is the morning of the fifth.</p>
                        <p>The negros for miles around were all in town yesterday. enjoying
                                    their jubilee of freedom.</p>
                        <p>This is Sunday the 9th. and I would have sent my letter sooner

                                    </placeName> about 30 miles from here, so that I could not send
                                    letters without paying postage.</p>
                        <p>Well I have good news for you this time, but I am allmost affraid
                                    to tell you what it is, lest it might not be true; It is that
                                    the reg't has orders to be mustered out of the service,
                                    but do not look for us too soon, for it will be some time before
                                    we can get there. Captain Schmucks regt expects to start for
                                    home in two or three days.</p>
                        <p>Now do not stop writing on account of what I send you this time,
                                    for I am very anxious to hear from, especially because your
                                    health is so poor.</p>
                        <p>I will let you know when we go to start home. I have nothing more
                                    to write this time.</p>
                        <p>My health is exceedingly good</p>
                        <p>May God bless you and the Children, is the earnest prayer of your

                    index. $5.00.)</head>
            <p>An impressive demonstration of the objective approach in biography has been made
                    during the past decade by the late James Garfield Randall and Ruth Painter
                    Randall. The concluding number of Randall's four-volume set, <hi rend="i">Lincoln the President</hi>, is recently from the press and Mrs.
                    Randall's <hi rend="i">Lincoln's Sons</hi> is now in print.
                    This last work and its companion volume, <hi rend="i">Mary Lincoln. Biography of
                        a Marriage</hi>, published in 1953, cover the domestic life of the Lincolns.</p>
            <p>It seems incredible that within a period of ten years, by the use of authentic
                    sources, these two writers have been able to completely nullify the generally
                    accepted stories of the Lincoln home life. For sixty years or more William
                    Herndon was considered the outstanding authority in this phase of Lincolniana.
                    However, the place of distinction which Professor Randall occupied among trained
                    historians allowed him to successfully challenge, where others had failed, the
                    validity of Herndon's widely used compilation of folklore and
                    traditions relating to the Lincoln family.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Randall's first book brought to the attention of the reading public
                    the great injustice done to the widow of Abraham Lincoln by the one-time law
                    partner of her husband. Now in the author's second volume she comes to
                    the defense of another member of the Lincoln household, Robert Todd Lincoln, who
                    was also greatly misrepresented by Herndon. While the casual reader will be
                    entertained by the escapades of Willie and Tad, serious students of the
                    Emancipator will be especially interested in the first objective biographical
                    study of Robert, the only one of the four Lincoln boys to reach maturity.</p>
            <p>The introductory paragraphs to the book, however, make it clear that the author
                    is to confine herself to Robert's personality and to purposely avoid
                    his public and business career. His relation to his parents, especially his
                    mother, is of great interest. His attempt to protect her from Herndon's
                    vicious attacks is praiseworthy. Those who have charged Robert with mercenary
                    incentives in relation to his mother's confinement in a sanatorium for
                    a season will do well to observe new evidence on the question introduced by the
                    author. Some students will have difficulty in following <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-052-2-090"/> Mrs. Randall's argument that a barrier was
                    built up between father and son. However, the author's explanation of
                    Robert's attitude towards the memory of his father in later years seems
                    to be well presented.</p>
            <p>The fact that Robert Lincoln on his first attempt failed to pass the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> entrance examinations placed somewhat of a stigma on his early
                    efforts in the field of learning. Undoubtedly it was the inadequate system of
                    education in the schools of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, rather than the deficiency of the student, that was responsible
                    for the necessity of a preparatory course at Exeter Academy. Mrs. Randall
                    exhibits an excerpt from a letter that Amos Tuck of Exeter, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName>, sent on August 24, 1860, to the President's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> friend, Judge David Davis, that should remove any suspicion of
                    Robert's mental ability as a youth. Tuck wrote, Robert "
                    'stands at the top of the ladder as a scholar, and is a singularly
                    discreet, well behaved, brilliant and promising young man' "
                    (p. 70).</p>
            <p>Why Robert Lincoln failed to enter the army while at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> University has always been a pointed question. His desire to enlist
                    when the war first broke is accepted generally. One would infer that parental
                    objection was responsible for the lateness of his entry into the service. Mrs.
                    Randall seems to be in agreement with those who feel Mrs. Lincoln's
                    neurotic condition and fear for a complete mental collapse in case of
                    Robert's enlistment were the primary factors which retarded him.
                    However, a letter which Robert wrote to Winfield M. Thompson throws new light on
                    the situation. Referring to his father, Robert observed:</p>
            <p>"After my graduation from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, I said to him that as he did not wish me to go into the army (his
                    reason having been that something might happen to me that would cause him more
                    official embarrassment than could be offset by any possible value of my military
                    service) I was going back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName> and enlist in Law School. … His letter afterward to
                    General Grant was the result of my renewed appeal to him." (Robert T.
                    Lincoln to Winfield M. Thompson, March 2, 1915, copy in Lincoln National Life
                    Foundation files.)</p>
            <p>While the reviewer was living at Hodgenville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, the birthplace of Lincoln, he often heard the story repeated that
                    claimed Robert Lincoln was intoxicated upon the occasion of his visit there on
                    May 31 in 1909. The occasion of his presence was the dedication of a bronze
                    statue of his father located on the courthouse square. Mrs. Randall makes it <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-052-2-091"/> quite clear that Robert had been in very
                    poor health at the time, and his collapse during the dedicatory service was due
                    to "the combination of emotion and heat exhaustion. … it was
                    thought he narrowly escaped a paralytic stroke" (p. 335).</p>
            <p>One would expect to find some reference by the author to the widely publicized
                    Lincoln manuscripts that Robert is said to have destroyed at his home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>. It is likely that many of Robert's own personal papers
                    and probably some of the personal letters which his father wrote to his mother
                    may have been burned. Mrs. Randall is in agreement with others who can speak
                    with some authority that the famous presidential papers are now intact at the
                    Library of Congress and were carefully preserved by Robert.</p>
            <p>The new picture of Robert drawn by Mrs. Randall makes one feel that he

            <p>The basic problem that permeated the Reconstruction Era—how to absorb
                    the Negro into the American body politic—is today more pertinent than
                    at any time since 1877 when a North, weary of radicalism and sympathetic to the
                    plight of the white southerner, agreed to drop the whole unpleasant mess in
                    exchange for acquiescence in the election of Hayes. Since then, the Negro has
                    made monumental gains in all parts of the nation, many of them through his own
                    efforts, and many through federal government intervention on his behalf. But the
                    Supreme Court rulings on school segregation rekindled deep prejudices and
                    created situations that are alarming thinking people everywhere.</p>
            <p>George R. Bentley's calm, straightforward account of the
                    Freedman's Bureau is especially welcome, therefore, as it illuminates
                    the working of an organization that was of central importance in the initial
                    period of adjustment after <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-052-2-092"/> emancipation.
                    This is by no means a simple task, for the bureau became immeshed in much of the
                    sordid politics of the day and served as a tool of the radical carpetbag
                    interests who hoped thereby to insure Republican political supremacy, and even
                    to revolutionize the social and economic bases of society in the South. It was
                    idealistic, humanitarian, eminently practical, and also partisan, irresponsible,
                    and corrupt at the same time.</p>
            <p>The author begins with the issue of "contraband" as it arose in
                    the early part of the war and traces the increasing need for centralized
                    government control as abolitionist sentiment and military necessity combined to
                    destroy the South's peculiar institution. Organized under General
                    Oliver O. Howard in 1865, the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands
                    had an almost impossible task from the start: limited funds, local officials too
                    few in number and often inexperienced and unsympathetic, a hostile white
                    population, a hostile President, to say nothing of serious doubts as to the
                    constitutionality of the entire undertaking. Yet it was supposed to protect
                    Negro rights, cultivate friendly relations between the races, encourage good
                    work habits, assist in organizing schools, give rations and medicines, operate a
                    bank, and supervise settlement of its wards on confiscated lands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">A History of the Freedmen's Bureau</hi> is a valuable
                    addition to the literature of the Civil War period and the only thorough study
                    of this aspect since Paul S. Peirce in 1904. It is regrettable that Bentley did
                    not provide a clear picture of General Howard himself, who remains a shadowy
                    figure throughout. The same could be said for other members of the bureau, no
                    one of whom is given anything beyond the briefest possible appraisal. Otherwise,
                    the documentation is excellent, and the delineation of the narrative flows
                    smoothly despite the intricate nature of the various issues involved. Even those
                    most familiar with the main problem will find new insights; and for the general
                    reader, this will prove a book both timely and rewarding.</p>

            <p>The editor of <hi rend="i">The Library of American Biography</hi> has made a wise
                    choice in singling out William Lloyd Garrison as the leader whose life and
                    activities were to represent the reform movement of the mid-nineteenth century.
                    This relationship has been portrayed by Professor Nye in a vivid narrative of
                    Garrison's active life and in a careful analysis of his position in
                    American history. With this work the excellent standard of this series of
                    biographical studies is maintained, and the author's reputation as a
                    Pulitzer-prize winning biographer is enhanced.</p>
            <p>The heritage of the rationalism of Thomas Jefferson and the active influence of a
                    religious revival and frontier democracy had merged to give the generation
                    before the Civil War confidence in the perfectability of mankind and in
                    man's capacity to remake society in terms of his own blueprints. Of the
                    many reform efforts of the era, Garrison's name is normally associated
                    with the dominant cause, abolitionism, but the fiery editor also took up his pen
                    in behalf of women's rights, pacifism, temperance, Utopian communism,
                    and anti-Sabbatarianism. Thus the complexity of this period of ferment, with its
                    sound as well as fanatic facets, is clearly represented in the life of this
                    zealous reformer, who, interestingly, could preach temperance but yet in his
                    obsession over his health, could imbibe generously of nostrums high in alcoholic
                    content, and who, despite his militant approach to the slavery issue, could
                    support non-resistance.</p>
            <p>Among Garrison's contemporaries, opinions as to his role in the
                    abolition movement varied between the conclusion of admirers such as Wendell
                    Phillips that Garrison created and largely controlled the movement and the
                    evaluation of a critic such as Henry Ward Beecher, who stated that the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> reformer was "no more than a blister on the anti-slavery
                    movement." Professor Nye cuts through this conflict of opinion and
                    carefully supports the conclusion that Garrison neither began the movement nor
                    contributed to its organization and extension as decisively as such men as
                    Theodore Dwight Weld and Arthur and Lewis Tappan. Even though abolitionism
                    "passed through him, not from him," the author notes that the
                    editor of the <hi rend="i">Liberator</hi> drove the slavery evil deep into the
                    country's conscience. In the South he became the symbol of all that was
                    dangerous to its society, and in the North he broke the "conspiracy of
                    silence" and <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-052-2-094"/> revealed slavery as
                    the moral problem that it was. Because of his relentless condemnation of the
                    evil, the vehemence of the language he employed, and his criticism of the
                    Constitution for the protection it afforded slavery, he was hated and abused.
                    But public reaction was to turn into respect when the cause he symbolized was
                    eventually vindicated.</p>
            <p>In the epilogue of the volume, Professor Nye reveals the mind of the reformer as
                    one that was consistent in its judgment of all things on standards of moral
                    right. The standards he employed were those of natural law as expressed in the
                    Declaration of Independence and of Christian ethics as revealed in the Bible.
                    Following a conscience to which God spoke directly, he opposed all man-made
                    authority, in church as well as in state, and devoted his life to the freedom of
                    the individual. With the integrity of his soul maintained before God, he could
                    enjoy the jeers of the crowd. This self-righteous independence, a characteristic
                    of the seventeenth century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName>, alienated many but also inspired confidence in others.</p>
            <p>The author has not neglected calling attention to Garrison's failings,
                    but, generally, his portrayal is a sympathetic one. In a vivid manner he has
                    also related the bitter factional controversies that took place within the
                    abolition crusade. And for the student of the period he has contributed a
                    clearer understanding of the major role played by the moral controversy
                    surrounding slavery in the coming of the Civil War.</p>

            <p>It is perhaps a coincidence that a life of Matthew Simpson should appear at a
                    time when great sectional issues are again stirring. For Bishop Simpson became
                    an ardent crusader for emancipation; he was a friend of President Lincoln during
                    the clash between North and South; and he was a staunch Republican even to the
                    extent of becoming one of the closest adherents of the Radicals in their war
                    against President Johnson. Robert D. Clark, who is chairman of the Speech
                    Department and acting Dean of the College of Liberal Arts in the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>, has undertaken to play the role of biographer of one of the
                    preeminent leaders of the Methodist church. His book follows <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-052-2-095"/> Simpson's early life, education, and
                    ministry, his presidency of Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University)
                    when he warred with Presbyterians over educational issues, his brief career as
                    an editor, and the manifold services he performed as a bishop of the Methodist
                    Episcopal church.</p>
            <p>Clark has prepared himself for this task by visiting and absorbing atmosphere in
                    the various localities in which Simpson lived as educator and clergyman. In the
                    main he has drawn on contemporary sources, of which the most extensively used
                    are the Simpson Papers in the Library of Congress. References are also made to
                    George R. Crooks' <hi rend="i">The Life of Bishop Matthew Simpson</hi>
                    (1890), published six years after the bishop's death and containing
                    Simpson's Diary and his Autobiography. More use might have been made of
                    William W. Sweet's <hi rend="i">The Methodist Episcopal Church and the
                        Civil War</hi> (1912) and <hi rend="i">Indiana Asbury-DePauw University,
                        1837–1987</hi> (1937). A very wide use of newspapers and
                    periodicals is to the author's credit.</p>
            <p>Not only has Clark succeeded in portraying the personality and character of
                    Bishop Simpson, but he has brought out with proper sympathy and a sense of
                    objectivity his accomplishments. For Simpson was a man of great stature. Clark
                    has done an excellent thing in showing the breadth of his interests and
                    activities—his attempt to co-ordinate science and religion in the
                    belief that evolution meant progress; and his sincere belief in education, a
                    role in which he did much to raise the intellectual level of the Methodist
                    church in its rivalry with the Presbyterians. Clearly delineated are his efforts
                    to have more bishops to carry the increasing burden of the expanding church, to
                    secure lay representation in its conferences, to improve its ecclesiastical
                    architecture, and to broaden its social tolerance. Incidentally, he was a warm
                    advocate of woman suffrage.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Clark frankly describes the man who put pressure on Lincoln
                    for more jobs for Methodists, worked closely with Stanton, and aggressively set
                    out to get property of the southern Methodists into the hands of the northern
                    church. Embittered by President Johnson's attitude toward this church
                    property question, he joined ranks with the Radical Republicans and used his
                    persuasive powers as an orator to get through the General Conference of the
                    Methodist Episcopal church a resolution endorsing the attempted conviction of
                    that much abused president. His intolerant attitude toward Johnson is in
                    contrast to his stirring funeral oration over Lincoln's grave.</p>
            <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-052-2-096"/>
            <p>In estimating this biography there are some adverse comments. The style is broken
                    by too frequent quotations, sometimes of one or two words, which make reading a
                    bit difficult. And, scholarly as Clark has been in the use of sources, one or
                    two glaring errors indicate a lack of historical knowledge which the friendly
                    critics of his manuscript failed to correct. In the index on p. 338 there is an
                    item on the "impeachment attempt" on President Johnson; as a
                    matter of fact the president was impeached, though not convicted. On p. 259 is
                    the statement that the Radical Republicans not only carried the congressional
                    election of 1866 but "seized control of the Electoral
                    College," a misleading statement in view of the fact that the Electoral
                    College exists only in presidential election years. The author seems able only
                    in his treatment of war and reconstruction problems to see much beyond his
                    immediate subject. Indiana Asbury University, in fact higher education
                    generally, is picked up suddenly and dropped with equal abruptness. Visits to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the homeland of the Methodist movement, are treated almost solely
                    from an antiquarian point of view; perhaps this is how the bishop himself
                    regarded his tours. In some instances the titles of chapters express a strained
                    effort at literary novelty.</p>
            <p>In conclusion it is accurate to state that the work is fundamentally biography,
                    not history. Yet it makes some contribution of an objective nature to our
                    knowledge of one of the most powerful ecclesiastical organizations in the <placeName>

            <p>In his life of Brooks Adams (1848–1927), Beringause has undertaken the
                    study of an unusual man, son of Charles Francis Adams, and brother of Henry
                    Adams, the historian. The career of Brooks Adams was confined to that of the
                    publicist and prophet of doom, although he longed for a powerful, active role in
                    public life which he never achieved. Even so, his influence touched some
                    important people: perhaps Henry Adams felt it most; Theodore Roosevelt finally
                    accepted Brooks Adams as an unofficial advisor; Henry Cabot Lodge found many of
                    his own views confirmed by <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-052-2-097"/> Brooks Adams,
                    his brother-in-law; and on the subject of legal education Dean Melville M.
                    Bigelow echoed the opinions of his colleague in the Law School at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> University.</p>
            <p>Brooks Adams set for himself a lofty objective: to discover the laws governing
                    human society. Strictly speaking he was not a historian. His method was to
                    arrive at some generalization or "scientific law" by a mystic
                    process. Then he sought to prove his intuitions by the evidence of the past.
                    Also he seriously posed as prophet of the future. Beringause is occasionally
                    impressed by the accuracy of the forecasts (p. 111 and p. 358).</p>
            <p>Adams demands a biographer who can trace his subject's thought through
                    book after book, article after article. Beringause shoulders this task, but
                    Adams frequently repeated himself, creating an almost insurmountable problem for
                    his biographer. He confronts it manfully by repeating where Adams repeated. The
                    result is an honest portrayal which gives the reader the impression of seeing
                    the same image in a dozen mirrors; and at places the repetition in full
                    quotations seems unnecessary. For example, on pp. 244–245 and p. 274
                    the same letter is quoted at length, albeit for different reasons. And the
                    quotations on p. 255 and p. 347 are confusing; the date for one of these is
                    wrong or else Adams repeated verbatim his letter of 1903.</p>
            <p>Beringause gives the reader a brief pen portrait of Brooks Adams about 1905. He
                    "was an imposing figure. … Although comparatively short of
                    stature, he had broad shoulders. His nose was Roman, and the stiffness with
                    which he held his patrician head gave him the tight stare and stark majesty of
                    the bald eagle" (p. 259).</p>
            <p>Beringause suggests that Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., may have started Adams on
                    his search for a philosophic system. Holmes lectured on the common law at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>
                    </placeName> Institute (1880) and traced its growth in line with a series of
                    master ideas and evolutionary principles. Adams later tried to do the same for
                    all human society.</p>
            <p>Beginning with an analysis of <hi rend="i">The Emancipation of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1887), the author moves on to <hi rend="i">The Law of
                        Civilization and Decay</hi> (1895), a basic work from which Adams dredged
                    material for years. One by one Beringause discusses the ideas of Adams on
                    bimetallism, the cyclical theory of civilizations, international Jewish bankers,
                    the Yellow Peril, the master race, military preparedness, imperialism, the need
                    for an isthmian canal, the need for strong national administration, and
                    dictatorship, unhampered by <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-052-2-098"/> the courts.
                    Adams, the conservative, went so far as to advocate state socialism to prevent
                    the collapse of civilization.</p>
            <p>Beringause gives the reader a clear view of Adams' method of
                    investigation. In 1894 he wrote to Henry that he was studying the thirteenth
                    century, but complained that in Venice "you can get nothing
                    … except archives. … By a process peculiar to myself, I
                    have by dint of watching here, arrived at my conclusions and I am about ready to
                    go" (p. 112). He informed Theodore Roosevelt in 1896 that <hi rend="i">The Law of Civilization and Decay</hi> was a piece of automatic writing,
                    "the work of some second self—a self who must be very
                    active, but who does not come to the surface" (pp. 131–132).</p>
            <p>Brooks and Henry Adams delighted in pseudo-scientific terminology. When writing
                    about society the brothers used such words as: "velocity,"
                    "energy," "mass,"
                    "momentum," "center of force," and
                    "equilibrium." But this practice could result in
                    Brooks' writing, in <hi rend="i">The New Empire</hi> (1902), that
                    " 'the core of Russia, revolving on Novgorod as on a pivot,
                    passed the segment of a circle' " (p. 240). Beringause wisely
                    does not try to explain that one.</p>
            <p>Adams always depended on correspondence or conversation with a few close friends
                    to bring into order his intuitions, opinions, and facts. Henry was his best
                    critic and coach, but Brooks repaid his debt by showering Henry with stimulating
                    letters and suggestive interpretations of history and current events. The
                    interaction between these two men forms a constant theme. Correspondence went
                    more smoothly than conversation in which the two brothers often
                    "excited, then irritated, and finally enraged each other" (p.
                    111).</p>
            <p>Beringause avoids the biographer's peril of hero-worship. In fact, one
                    could wish that his clear analyses of Adams' writings were matched by a
                    little more understanding of Adams as a man. Perhaps Beringause prefers to let
                    the reader draw his own conclusions, but obviously Brooks Adams was a tragic
                    figure; a man of great gifts of mind, possessing energy, wealth, leisure, social
                    position, a small but interesting circle of friends, and the desire to be
                    "useful." Nevertheless he failed to join these potentialities
                    to any responsible position save for a few happy years after 1903 when he
                    lectured at the Law School of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> University. Throughout his life he was vain, pompous, and
                    hypersensitive, but as he grew older he became more darkly pessimistic, more
                    savage and violent in expression, more <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-052-2-099"/>
                    eccentric, and "unusable" in diplomacy or politics.
                    "Kill Wilson!" he yelled to Lodge. Herbert Hoover he attacked
                    as a "chief Bolshevik."</p>
            <p>Perhaps Beringause takes too literally the thunderings of Adams, but what else
                    could Beringause do? Adams was apparently a lonely, desperate man, homesick for
                    the world of his father, Charles Francis, and grandfather, John Quincy Adams.
                    Perhaps much that Adams said and wrote was uttered irresponsibly—when
                    he was seriously challenged, for example, while advocating state socialism in
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Constitutional Convention (1917) he backed down and spoke for
                    retaining capitalism. And many of his savage writings are not the words of a
                    truly revolutionary character prepared to act on them. They seem, rather, a
                    strange lament for a lost imagined world—Arnold's "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dover</settlement>
                    </placeName> Beach" reworked into fantastic "laws of
                    society." The man sensing Adams' predicament most clearly was
                    probably the Benedictine monk who wrote that Adams was "
                    'groping blindly and longing pathetically for a <hi rend="i">patria</hi>' " (p. 386).</p>
            <p>The chapter titles and sub-heads of this book may have a literary charm for some
                    readers. They are a comment on Adams' life in themselves. But as guides
                    to the materials of the book, the chapter titles are only confusing. The text is
                    smoothly written with few mistakes. But surely Brooks Adams did not write:
                        "<hi rend="i">panim et circensis</hi>" (p. 189) or
                    attribute to Christ the words of the importunate father in Mark 9:24 (p. 360).
                    And surely Henry Adams had taught Brooks enough medieval history to keep him
                    from thinking that the medieval state "forced conformity on all ranks
                    of society" (p. 374). But these are obvious mechanical flaws. The book
                    has the merit of resting solidly on the previously inaccessible Adams Papers so
                    that it now stands as the best available treatment of Brooks Adams.</p>

            <p>In 1918, an article concerning the Nonpartisan League entitled "A <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Fire" appeared in the <hi rend="i">Country Gentleman.</hi>
                    It seems reasonable to surmise that this phrase suggested the title for the book
                    under review. The bright orange and black binding seems designed to re-enforce
                    the holocaustic <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-052-2-100"/> impression created by the
                    title. The chapter headings, almost sensational in some instances, contribute to
                    the central motif. The author's lively style which carries the
                    fast-moving action through sixteen fact-laden chapters adds the final
                    pyrotechnic touch. After seeming to equate an objective account of a
                    controversial issue with one that would give universal satisfaction, Professor
                    Morlan states his purpose in the following sentence: "This study is
                    … an effort to chronicle with fairness and accuracy the dramatic and
                    swift-moving story of this unique political movement" (p. viii).</p>
            <p>According to a sentence in the preface, "representative
                    newspapers" were the principal source of data. Although no newspapers
                    are listed in the bibliography, the abundant citations to newspapers in the
                    footnotes, especially to the <hi rend="i">Non-partisan Leader</hi>, confirm this
                    statement. Of the rather small number of collections of papers and manuscripts
                    that were used the collection of National Nonpartisan League Papers is the most
                    important. A large group of pamphlets issued by the Nonpartisan League
                    constitutes the other major portion of the bibliography. It is difficult to
                    escape the conclusion that the author has relied to a disproportionate degree
                    upon official league publications and materials which must come logically under
                    his own judgment that, "Virtually all writing pertaining to the League
                    published during its ascendancy reflects extremely biased points of
                    view" (p. viii). The reviewer finds it difficult to understand how a
                    fair and accurate "chronicle" can be the product of excessive
                    reliance upon data derived from writers on one side of a controversial issue.
                    This is all the more difficult when much of the anti-league material was used by
                    way of quotations from the opposition press that appeared in the columns of the
                        <hi rend="i">Non-partisan Leader.</hi> There are at least two illustrations
                    of the basic principle that the student of history should go to the sources
                    rather than rely upon secondary accounts. The reviewer cannot reconcile the data
                    derived from the <hi rend="i">Leader's</hi> summary of an address made
                    by John S. Williams, <placeName>

                    material contained in the annual report of the comptroller of the currency which
                    was used as the basis of the address. At the least, the comptroller's
                    figures do not clearly support the conclusion that "no less than two
                    thirds (96) of the national banks in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ndu">North Dakota</country>
                    </placeName> were charging usurious rates" (p. 17). A careful reading
                    of the speech of Congressman Patrick <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-052-2-101"/> D.
                    Norton as it appears in the <hi rend="i">Congressional Record</hi> does not lead
                    to the same conclusions that the author reached on the basis of the report
                    contained in the <hi rend="i">Leader.</hi> The speech was prompted by an
                    editorial contained in the <hi rend="i">Des Moines Capital</hi>, not by items

                        </placeName> Fire</hi> toward the Nonpartisan League may be described as
                    sympathetic. This is apparent not only in the selection of materials, but also
                    in the explanations that are given for the failure of some of the business
                    projects of the league, such as the Consumers' United Stores Company
                    and the Home Building Association, and the different treatment accorded to
                    similar acts depending upon whether they were performed by the friends or the
                    foes of the league. Thus the opposition "screamed" its
                    sentiments, whereas the <hi rend="i">Leader</hi> "expressed its
                    hopes," "carefully and repeatedly warned," or
                    "set the matter straight" as the occasion required. There are
                    several examples of the author's resort to heavy irony in describing
                    the arguments of the opposition. The "tirade" of an
                    over-zealous local official is referred to as "the reasoned view of a
                    dispassionate and unprejudiced law enforcement official" (p. 168) and

                    included in a list of "flaming radical publications."</p>
            <p>The book presents in considerable detail the political history of the Nonpartisan
                    League with the emphasis quite naturally upon the states of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ndu">North Dakota</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> . It is entirely reasonable that Arthur C. Townley should be the
                    central figure, but some will question the degree to which attention is focused
                    upon him to the almost complete exclusion of other prominent leaders of the
                    movement. The principal result of this emphasis is to leave the reader with
                    quite a clear impression of Townley, but only a slight acquaintanceship with the
                    other men. The description of the techniques' employed by Townley
                    should be of special value to those who have a particular interest in group
                    dynamics, especially the, organizations and direction of grass-roots political
                    movements of the protesting variety. The rather detailed description of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> phases of the "red-baiting" and
                    "witch-hunting" activities that characterized the closing
                    years of the second Wilson administration has value quite apart from its

                    delineation of the origins of political co-operation <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-052-2-102"/> between farming and laboring groups. The inadequate
                    attention given by American historians to the role of the urban community is
                    illustrated in this volume by the superficial analysis of the dominance by the

                    freight rates, and usurious interest rates are listed among the developments

                    the growing tendency to look to the federal government for help instead of to
                    the state capital are proposed as some of the causes which led to the decline of
                    the movement. The greatest value of the book lies in its detailed treatment of a

                    several illustrations which are the product of the distaff side of the

                    </placeName> life in the eighteen-eighties and early nineties. There are
                    occasional throwbacks to earlier years, and glimpses ahead of World War I. Its
                    greatest appeal is to old residents and their children, many of them now living
                    afar. However, students everywhere will find it of value because statements are
                    founded on fact, many of the persons and events described are of national
                    importance, and the period surveyed is one of extraordinary local and national
                    expansion, both economic and cultural.</p>
            <p>The book is divided into four parts: "Places,"
                    "People," "Events," and "I
                    Remember." Of the first three parts, Mrs. Briney writes in the
                    Foreword, "More than to any other person, I am indebted to my father,
                    John D. Otter, who before his death in 1950 told me many entrancing stories of
                    the people, places and events depicted in this book. If I have been able to
                    recapture to any degree the flavor and charm of the city of his youth, it is
                    because of him." She has succeeded in this endeavor as she presents
                    with vividness, accuracy, and humor, vanishing or changed buildings, streets and
                    neighborhoods; prominent characters, including world-famous authors, actors, and
                    eccentrics; and significant and unusual happenings of a former generation.</p>
            <p>In the fourth part Mrs. Briney portrays her own childhood and youth, and again
                    "recaptures the flavor and charm of the city." Her account of
                    home life in St. James Court, a beautiful residential section, is delightful.
                    Young and old will appreciate the descriptions of clubs and parties, of dancing
                    school with closing exhibition at the famous old Macauley's Theatre and
                    of a notable Christmas when Santa brought the little girl an ermine muff. The
                    final chapter is a poignant account of activities connected with World War I and
                    the departure of one's boy friends for "over there."</p>

            <p>Fort Owen was established in 1850 as a trading post by "Major"
                    John Owen, a frontier sutler. It was located in the Bitter Root Valley in what
                    is now western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>
                    </placeName>. The post was well situated on land bought from Jesuit
                    missionaries, among peaceful Flathead Indians, and in an area undergoing a shift
                    from fur-trading to agricultural operations. The post was commodious, fortified,
                    and well stocked with trading goods. Owen's annual business
                    transactions varied considerably and ranged in amount from less than
                    $1,000 to nearly $10,000. One surprising and decidedly
                    esoteric feature of Fort Owen was its library. Owen not only liked to read books
                    but he was discriminating in his library selections, which included Charles
                    Darwin's <hi rend="i">Journal of Researches into the Natural History,
                        The Writings of Thomas Jefferson</hi>, John Milton's <hi rend="i">Poetical Works</hi>, and John Locke's <hi rend="i">Essay
                        Concerning Human Understanding.</hi> Lieutenant John Mullan, who examined
                    this library, declared it was " 'the finest library I have
                    seen on the north Pacific coast'" (p. 247). Due to
                    Owen's mental failure, the post was sold in 1872, and changing
                    conditions thereafter caused Fort Owen to join the list of frontier
                    institutional relics.</p>
            <p>As indicated in the title, the core of this volume is the Fort Owen Ledger.
                    Entries into this ledger were made by Owen from the time of the beginning of the
                    post in 1850 and for a decade thereafter. In presenting the material of this
                    book, the editor has, in addition to his introduction and notes, reproduced
                    major portions of the ledger and provided brief biographical sketches of those
                    carried on account. The book as presented has the obvious value of providing the
                    specialist with information on persons or customers in the area, variety of
                    livestock, merchandise bought and sold, and at what prices. And out of this
                    ledger one may likewise glean interesting tidbits of social history, such as
                    amounts paid "woman" for making shoes, amounts paid to find
                    lost or stolen livestock, kinds of cloth available for sale, amounts carried on
                    credit (whites, as compared with Indians), who bought liquor and who did not.</p>
            <p>Much effort has been expended by the editor to make this volume useful in the
                    ways indicated. There are minor <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-052-2-105"/>
                    inconsistencies in the spelling of place names, especially between those

            <p>Many of the studies of the Iroquois nation stress the role of these Indians in
                    the Anglo-French struggle for supremacy in America. The questions of the
                    allegiance of the Iroquois to the English or of their relations with the French
                    have received much attention. As a result the relationship of the Iroquois to
                    the various English colonies has often been slighted. It is the contention of
                    the editor of <hi rend="i">The Livingston Indian Records</hi> that these
                    documents will help to restore "some balance to Iroquois
                    history" and that they will throw additional light upon their relations
                    with the English colonies. In the opinion of the reviewer the documents by
                    themselves are often disappointing in this respect.</p>
            <p>Robert Livingston who served as secretary of Rensselaerswyck, town clerk of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and secretary for Indian affairs had the task of transcribing the
                    conference minutes and documents concerning the Indian relations into the
                    permanent record book. <hi rend="i">The Livingston Indian Records</hi> consist
                    of the drafts and copies of these conference minutes and documents which
                    Livingston retained for his personal file. He also retained material inherited
                    from his predecessor as secretary of Rensselaerswyck. Since the first two
                    volumes of the permanent record books have disappeared, the Livingston documents
                    now on deposit in the <placeName>

            <p>One series of documents deals with the concern of <placeName>

                    tie of the Iroquois with the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                    </placeName>-Iroquois problems over land, trade, and the French question. So the
                    question of the French-English struggle and of the position of the Iroquois
                    appears again and again. Scattered throughout the records <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-052-2-106"/> one may find additional information concerning
                    trade, land control, and intertribal relations and movements on the <placeName>

            <p>Two introductory articles precede the records. Leder has written a brief sketch
                    of the career of Robert Livingston and an explanation of the disposition of the
                    Livingston records. Paul A. W. Wallace in a second article gives a brief outline
                    of the history of the Iroquois. Both articles, while brief, are adequate for
                    introductory purposes.</p>
            <p>The documents themselves are arranged in chronological order with italicized
                    introductions giving the name of the speaker and date. This arrangement is
                    sometimes confusing to the general reader who may be following a particular
                    topic. There is no index, and while there are occasional explanatory footnotes,
                    additional explanatory material in the footnotes would be beneficial.
                    Pictographs explaining the legend of the founding of the Five Nations are
                    scattered throughout the text. These are of dubious value and add little to the
                    book. A glossary of Indian tribal names used within the documents is also
                    provided.</p>

            <p>Historians and ethnologists have long been intrigued with the significant
                    influence of the European-introduced horse on the culture of the North American
                    Plains Indians. Attention has heretofore been focused, however, on the diffusion
                    of the horse among the Plains tribes. No detailed analysis of the horse complex
                    as it existed in the nineteenth-century culture of a specific Plains Indian
                    group has been attempted prior to Ewers' present excellent monograph.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Horse in Blackfoot Indian Culture</hi> divides naturally into
                    three parts: (1) An introductory ethnohistorical discussion, carefully
                    documented, of the dates and manner of the acquisition of the horse by Plains
                    and Plateau peoples from, ultimately, two southern sources of diffusion (Santa
                    Fe and San Antonio); (2) a large body of descriptive field data on Blackfoot
                    wealth in horses; care, breeding, and training of horses; gear; the use of the
                    horse in camp movements, <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-052-2-107"/> hunting, and war;
                    the part played by the horse in trade and recreation and as a factor in
                    Blackfoot social relations and religion; (3) two general chapters on the
                    influence of the horse on a specific Plains Indian culture, and on the Plains
                    Indian horse complex as a whole. A short appendix describes the use of mules
                    among the Blackfoot.</p>
            <p>Comparative material on the horse complex in Plains and Plateau cultures other
                    than Blackfoot is presented in footnotes and brief comparative sections within
                    the main part of the study. Much of Ewers' comparative material is
                    drawn from documentary sources rather than from ethnographic
                    reports—which in itself indicates what Ewers explicitly points out,
                    that "For the entire Plains area there has been an appalling lack of
                    detailed analysis of the horse complex" (p. xi).</p>
            <p>The generally interested reader will find parts (1) and (3) of Ewers'
                    study especially rewarding, and it is difficult to envisage any American-trained
                    ethnologist or student of American history ignoring these sections. Once having
                    read them, it is safe to predict that many scholars, even though hard pressed
                    for reading time, will sample a goodly number, at least, of the descriptive
                    sections of (2). The chapter on wealth in horses among the Blackfoot and other
                    tribes (pp. 20–32), read in conjunction with a short section on the
                    horse as a factor of social status (pp. 240–244) serves to underscore
                    what many ethnologists have found among various present-day Plains
                    groups—namely, that possession of horses on a noneconomic level is
                    still a prestige factor among Plains Indian groups.</p>
            <p>In making his study of the horse complex Ewers utilized three avenues of
                    approach—ethnographical field work among the Blackfoot over an
                    extended period of time, extensive ethnohistorical research in published
                    documentary materials, and examination of museum materials. The successful
                    combination of these three methods makes his monograph a definitive work. Its
                    originality is attested by the fact that, now the study is published, one
                    wonders why such an obviously significant subject was suffered to remain so long
                    neglected by American ethnologists, particularly by those concerned with the
                    cultures of the Plains Indians and historical questions relating to these
                    cultures.</p>
            <p>A study of the European-introduced horse among the North American Indians in
                    general remains to be written. Although the horse may have had most spectacular
                    influence on native cultures in the Northern Plains region, it is safe to <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-052-2-108"/> assume that in the Southeast, in the
                    Eastern Woodlands, and in the Great Basin—to name only a few other
                    areas—the introduction of the horse also affected native cultures to
                    a greater or lesser degree. For the wider study of the horse in native North
                    America, Ewers' work could well serve as a model of method and
                    presentation.</p>

            <p>"It makes little difference … where one opens the record of
                    the history of the Indians; every page and every year has its dark stain. The
                    story of one tribe is the story of all, varied only by differences of time and
                    place; but neither time nor place makes any difference in the main
                    facts."</p>
            <p>Although this quotation is not from Blumenthal's <hi rend="i">American
                        Indians Dispossessed</hi>, it might well be. And it could appropriately be
                    written as a dust jacket blurb for the volume. The present work is in many
                    respects an appendage to the source of the quotation, Helen Hunt
                    Jackson's <hi rend="i">A Century of Dishonor</hi>, written some three
                    quarters of a century ago. Mrs. Jackson's purpose was to provoke
                    solicitude for the Indian; and her book was largely responsible for organization
                    of the Indian Rights Association and indirectly responsible for the Dawes Act.</p>
            <p>It seems as though Blumenthal has a purpose in mind. On each successive page he
                    builds his case and piles up evidence to support it. Had the book been published
                    a decade earlier one might readily have surmised the author was lobbying for
                    federal legislation to compensate the Indians for all they had suffered and lost
                    over the years, possibly to establish an agency such as the Indian Claims
                    Commission, which was created in 1946. After some one hundred and sixty pages,
                    however, this commission is mentioned briefly and summarily dismissed:
                    "the result [of the Commission] has been a clutter and legal tangle,
                    baffling to the layman, and dilatory if not obstructive so far as justice to
                    tribal claims is concerned" (p. 164).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">American Indians Dispossessed</hi> is apparently not intended to be
                    other than a damning indictment of a not-too-pleasant aspect of the frontier
                    advance in American history. <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-052-2-109"/> The author
                    asserts: "This has been a factual recital. … No flourishes
                    of style or memorable passages adorn the presentation. The record of
                    double-dealing is eloquent without purple prose" (p. 185). This is
                    hardly an accurate statement, however, because the volume is liberally sprinkled
                    with such "flourishes of style" as: "this deception
                    was perpetrated"; "that [the treaty] … was
                    fraudulent in intent is indubitable"; "no scruples restrained
                    his [William Henry Harrison's] remorseless pressure, prevarication, and
                    deceit in victimizing the tribes over whom he had browbeating sway";
                    "no iota of moral compunction entered into the dispossession of the
                    Indians"; "sordid motives … permeated with
                    fraud"; "relentless white intrusion";
                    "fraught with … sordid manoeuvres";
                    "sordid blackguardism"; "orgy of fraud"; and
                    "orgy of exploitation" (pp. 14, 17, 35–36, 58, 37,
                    48, 53, 97, 99, 111).</p>
            <p>According to the author, his findings are from "documentary sources,
                    augmented by findings of reliable authorities" (p. 185), which he
                    variously describes, for example, as "without a peer in the legal angle
                    of Indian Affairs" (p. 176), "a foremost authority"
                    (p. 166), "a prime authority on the frontier history" (p.
                    116), "a careful and qualified regional historian" (p. 112).
                    As accurately as these labels may describe the historians and writers concerned,
                    however, quoting them out of context sometimes conveys the wrong impressions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">American Indians Dispossessed</hi> presents a picture that is
                    completely negative. It does not present the whole story. It rejects as
                    inadequate and unsatisfactory every effort that has and is being made to right
                    the wrongs herein depicted. It offers no constructive suggestions to improve the
                    situation. The reader is inclined to gain a feeling of hopelessness and futility
                    for the Indian and a sense of purposelessness for the volume.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Meaning of America; Essays Toward an Understanding of the
                        American Spirit.</hi> By Leland D. Baldwin. (<placeName>

                    </placeName> Press, 1955, pp. 319. Maps and bibliography. $4.00.)</head>
            <p>The title of the volume would seem to imply an essay of something like two
                    hundred pages, more or less, but the subtitle, "Essays Toward an
                    Understanding of the American Spirit," suggests something different.
                    The headings selected <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-052-2-110"/> for the sixteen
                    chapters that make up the volume reveal a rather unusual treatment of such a
                    subject as "The Meaning of America." The reviewer cannot avoid
                    wondering why the author did not write a single essay on his chosen subject and
                    avoid reproducing so much of what had appeared in previous writings.</p>
            <p>Under any plan, such a subject as "The Meaning of America"
                    would be difficult to handle, but to accomplish something definite by writing
                    sixteen chapters with a variety of titles seems to have been a daring venture.
                    At best, the resulting volume seems to call for a further effort based on its
                    contents, perhaps, but nevertheless a single essay with the title, "The
                    Meaning of America."</p>
            <p>The sixteen chapters that make up the book under review are not historical
                    narratives, but each is in the nature of a discussion, and, in these chapters,
                    the author expresses a multitude of opinions. Among the chapter headings are
                    included the following: "Hamilton and Jefferson";
                    "The Rampageous West"; "The Southern Search for a
                    Veto"; "The Gospel of Wealth"; "The
                    Pragmatic Challenge"; "The New Deal and the Welfare
                    State"; and "How Fares the American Mission." These
                    are seven of the sixteen chapter titles, the last being the heading of the
                    final, or sixteenth, chapter of the volume.</p>
            <p>Presumably the final chapter should reveal the author's conception of
                    "The Meaning of America," but it seems to leave the reader
                    guessing. Perhaps the author is wise in not trying to state too definitely the
                        <hi rend="i">meaning</hi> of America, since such a statement is indeed
                    difficult to fashion. One does not need to fear to hazard an opinion that
                    Baldwin and many other thinkers will have the opportunity to give thought to the
                    question that he has raised for some years to come.</p>

                    Yet for more than a century he played an indispensable role in the operations of

            </p>
            <p>In the nine chapters which comprise Miss Nute's book she has assembled
                    about all most readers need care to know about the class of men to which the
                    book is devoted. There are chapters on the fur trade, on the <hi rend="i">voyageur</hi> himself and on his canoe, on voyaging, on fort life, and on
                        <hi rend="i">voyageur</hi> songs. Three concluding chapters deal with the
                    role of the <hi rend="i">voyageur</hi> as soldier, as settler, and as explorer.</p>
            <p>It is well that Miss Nute's book has been made available to the current
                    generation of readers. A thorough scholar, she knows how to write entertainingly
                    and well. The men she celebrates followed a perilous calling. In <placeName>

                    </placeName>, within recent years the reviewer has listened to the legend of <hi rend="i">Le Canot du Nord</hi> (The North Canoe) recited by a member of one
                    of the city's old French families as he had learned it from his
                    ancestors. In the days of the Old Regime in <placeName>

                    </placeName> the young men left their homes in large numbers to enter as <hi rend="i">voyageurs</hi> or <hi rend="i">coureurs de bois</hi> upon the life
                    of the northwestern wilderness. They seldom returned in the flesh, but on every
                    New Year's eve the ghostly spirits of those who had lost their lives
                    among the wild beasts and still wilder men of the north country flew back over
                    the tree-tops in a great canoe to rejoin for a brief spell the old folks at home

            <p>Hans Peter Hanssen published his memoirs in Danish, <hi rend="i">Fra
                    Krigstiden</hi>, in Copenhagen in 1924. Oscar O. Winther has now translated
                    those parts of Hanssen's book which best supplement already available
                    material on <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and especially on the problems of the Danish minority in Schleswig
                    during World War I. The editing is done with unusual care and fullness. Ralph H.
                    Lutz contributes a 42-page introduction, which includes a sketch of
                    Hanssen's life and an appreciation of his work. Biographical notes at
                    the end of the volume include thumb-nail sketches of 265—nearly
                    all—of the individuals mentioned in the text. There is a good index.
                    Although without illustrations and with only an endpaper map, the book is neatly
                    printed and almost letter-perfect. The only typographical error noted makes the
                    life span of Frau Minna Cauer extend from 1482 to 1922 (p. 377). The plan of
                    omitting materials easily available from other sources is doubtless justified,
                    although it sometimes leaves gaps probably disconcerting to readers not familiar
                    with the period.</p>
            <p>Born on a farm in Danish Schleswig in 1862, two years before the area was taken
                    from <placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                    </placeName> by Prussia, Hanssen thoroughly absorbed the Danish point of view
                    and continually championed it in his newspaper and in lectures. He served in the
                    Prussian Landtag from 1896 to 1908, and from 1906 on in the German Reichstag,
                    where he was the recognized leader of the movement for the return of northern
                    Schleswig to <placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                    </placeName>. He faithfully kept a diary, which fully reflects his primary
                    interests in the Schleswig problem. However, his membership in the Reichstag and
                    his sitting with its important Finance Committee gave him first hand knowledge
                    of much that transpired in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> during World War I, and this aspect of his diary has wider interest
                    than the important, but more limited, Schleswig question.</p>
            <p>To Hanssen there was nothing glorious in the war. With the German mobilization on
                    August 1 in his home town, he saw "pale, serious men, duly resigned:
                    women dissolved in tears; young couples who, without thought of those about
                    them, tightly embraced each other; sobbing children—all feeling
                    themselves caught by the inflexible and inevitable grip of fate" (p.
                    10). Arrested and imprisoned, along with other Danes, he was soon released to
                    attend a special meeting of the Reichstag. Arriving in Berlin he found a
                    "heavy, sad, and depressed atmosphere" (p. 14). By September
                    11 he found the public demanding "at least one victory a day
                    … When that fails, general apathy is evident" (p. 64).</p>
            <pb n="219" id="VAA4025-052-2-113"/>
            <p>From mid-1916 on Hanssen mentions with increasing frequency and concern the food
                    shortage felt by all classes. Fuel shortages also became acute. Black market
                    activities flourished. Conditions in the prisoner of war camps became worst of
                    all, with hunger, sickness, overwork, and barbarous punishments.</p>
            <p>Hansen was highly critical of the press censorship. His own and all other
                    Danish-language papers were suppressed for the first few weeks of the war and
                    had to operate under many restrictions from then on. He was particularly
                    concerned that members of the Reichstag knew less of what was happening than did
                    the public in enemy and neutral countries, and therefore translated material
                    from Copenhagen papers for their benefit. He was equally critical of the efforts
                    of the Press Bureau of the Foreign Office to bribe the press in other countries,
                    especially <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName>, and Rumania. "In such a way," he remarked,
                    "is this vulgar war managed. As the Chancellor has said, no means are
                    beneath the Government if it is thought that they can further the interests of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>" (p. 112).</p>
            <p>The decision to resort to unlimited submarine warfare on February 1, 1917, came
                    after long discussion, and after it appeared that there was no other way to
                    defeat <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The Admiralty presented statistics to show that submarines would
                    sink enough British shipping that "by fall the Island Kingdom will
                    sprawl like a fish in the reeds and beg for peace" (p. 165). The chance
                    that unlimited submarine warfare would bring the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> into the war was answered in three ways: that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would not be able to contribute anything in a military way; that
                    the war in any case would be ended before the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> could make any contribution; and—a point of interest for
                    Indiana readers—that isolationism in the Middle and Far West might
                    keep the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from entering at all.</p>
            <p>Throughout the war period Hanssen worked in close touch with representatives of
                    the other minority groups within <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>—the Poles and the Alsatians—and was able to
                    gather support from various political leaders, especially Social Democrats and
                    Progressives. The diary reaches its climax, so far as he was concerned, with the
                    assurance he received after the Armistice from the new provisional government,
                    that "the North Schleswig question should, in view of President
                    Wilson's peace program, be solved on the basis of the right of the
                    people to self-determination" (p. 367). Rejoicing with Hanssen in
                    prospects for their own minorities <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-052-2-114"/> to be
                    freed from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> were the Polish leader Wojciech Korfanty, who exclaimed,
                    "Now life is worth living," and the Alsatian priest who added
                        "<hi rend="i">Donnerwetter, ja</hi>!" (p. 323). A
                    Schleswig plebiscite in 1920 resulted in turning over to <placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                    </placeName> substantially the area that Hanssen had advocated.</p>
            <p>Professor Winther, the Indiana University Press, and all concerned are to be
                    thanked for bringing Hanssen's valuable and dramatic diary to
                    English-speaking people.</p>
