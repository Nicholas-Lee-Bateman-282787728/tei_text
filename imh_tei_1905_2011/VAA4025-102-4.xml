            <p>ELFRIEDA LANG</p>
            <p>As this issue of the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> went to press, we received news of the death of Elfrieda
                    Lang, at the age of 102. Lang, a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>
                    </placeName> native, received her BA, MA, and PhD in history from Indiana University. From 1945
                    through 1953, she served as assistant editor of the IMH under editor John Barnhart. During the 1940s
                    and 1950s she also authored a number of articles in the magazine, most focusing on
                    nineteenth-century migration to Indiana and on German Americans in the state. More recent readers of
                    the magazine may recognize her name from the title pages of two of the IMHs three twenty-five-year
                    indexes, which she initiated and edited. For many years after the creation of these invaluable
                    volumes (the contents of which have since been placed online at the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> website,
                    www.indiana.edu/~imaghist), Lang's alphabetized boxes of index cards rested on the shelves
                    of a succession of associate editors. She spent most of her subsequent career working for the IUB
                    library system, including a long and productive term at the Lilly Library. Former <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> associate editor Lorna Lutes Sylvester recalls Lang as an editor and historian who
                    "devoted her life to her career and contributed beyond measure to knowledge in her
                    field."</p>

            <p>On February 23-24, 2007, the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> hosts the annual meeting of the Indiana

                    opportunity for registrants to enjoy a program of papers and discussions on the diverse ways in
                    which history makes itself vital to the lives of a range of audiences. Panels on historical
                    documentaries, on journalists' use of historical research, on innovative collecting
                    projects, and on <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-102-4-010"/> the management of historic sites will join

            <p>IMH DIGITIZATION GRANT</p>
            <p>Working with the <hi rend="i">IMH,</hi> Indiana University's Digital Library Program has
                    secured a grant from the Indiana State Library which will allow for the digitization of the
                    journal's full text dating back to its first issue in 1905. Work for the grant project,
                    which was announced in September 2006, has already begun in earnest, with the target of having the
                    full run of the journal freely accessible to the public before the end of 2007. While the most
                    recent issues will continue to be available only to <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> subscribers and Indiana
                    Historical Society members, the bulk of the journal's 101-year run will now be fully
                    text-searchable, allowing students, scholars, and home users not only to identify the site of useful
                    material but to gain direct access to that material through their computers. As in the past, the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> will continue to furnish recent issues (post-2000) to the users of the EBSCO
                    Academic Premier and History Cooperative databases.</p>

                    </placeName>-based evangelist E. Howard Cadle. Drawing from his 1932 autobiography, the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> offered a summary of Cadle's career. Having spent his youth entangled in
                    various vices, so the story went, Cadle converted to Christianity as a young adult and
                    "promised his mother he would reform and spend his life helping unfortunates."
                    Success in several business ventures led to the construction of the Cadle Tabernacle in downtown <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1921. After losing control of the building within two years, Cadle mounted a
                    successful campaign to buy it back in 1931. Using the Tabernacle as his base of operation, he gained
                    a vast regional audience over the course of the next decade by becoming an "evangelist of
                    the air," as the <hi rend="i">Times</hi>'s headline tagged him. The moniker
                    possessed a double meaning: it referred both to his practice of conducting revival meetings in

            <p>Cadle's obituary was by no means the first notice that he had received from national
                    publications. In March 1939, <hi rend="i">Life</hi> had published a five-page photo spread about his
                    evangelistic pursuits, describing him as the most recent "in the long line of free-lance
                    revivalists who have won fame and fortune by exhorting U.S. sinners to repentance." The
                    same year, <hi rend="i">Radio Guide</hi> characterized him as "a combination of Horatio
                    Alger's most persistent and heroic character, Henry Ford, and Billy Sunday."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite the attention that Cadle's life and death attracted in major media outlets, his fame
                    proved fleeting. The Cadle Tabernacle stood at the corner of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Streets for twenty-five years after the founder's death, but both the building
                    and the evangelistic operation began declining rapidly in the mid-1950s. Historian Kenneth Jackson,
                    researching a book about the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s, observed the structure in its last days and
                    described it as "an unwashed and unimpressive building .... The creaking floors are now
                    covered with dust; the air is musty. The ghostlike atmosphere is quite unlike that which prevailed
                    in the 1920s, when the auditorium reverberated with the prayers and hymns of the
                        faithful."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The Cadle family sold the building soon afterward, and
                    the new owner razed it to make way for a parking lot. Cadle's radio program continued under
                    the supervision of his two eldest children; when it ceased production after their deaths in the
                    early 1990s, the last lingering trace of the evangelist's erstwhile fame, or even his
                    existence, faded from public consciousness. Today the most visible surviving tribute to Cadle and
                    his Tabernacle can be found not in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but 100 miles south of the city, where an etched rendering of the Tabernacle on the
                    back of Cadle's tombstone in a small graveyard in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredericksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> stands as a curious testament to a nearly forgotten past.</p>
            <p>Cadle has been nearly lost to memory among historians as well. He plays no role in scholarly accounts
                    of early twentieth-century religious history, nor has there been a scholarly article focused on him.
                    This neglect is not entirely without reason. Cadle's ministry was neither the first of its
                    kind nor the largest. By the time he built his structure in downtown <placeName>

                    been broadcasting for nearly a decade by the time Cadle debuted his own radio program in 1932. And
                    though Cadle claimed a huge audience for his program, it was limited to a loyal base in the Midwest
                    and upper South. It never achieved truly national significance.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>If Cadle's legacy is slim, his story is nonetheless important, for it offers a case study in

                    urbanization. Biblical criticism and widespread acceptance of Darwinian evolution threatened the

            <p>In the religious realm, the evangelical consensus that dominated the culture at Cadle's
                    birth shattered as he approached middle age, leaving him, and others like him, apparent losers in
                    the fundamentalistmodernist controversy. Historians traditionally held that Clarence

                    the beginning of fundamentalism's demise. Recent scholarship has thoroughly dispatched that
                    myth, suggesting that fundamentalists were momentarily humiliated in 1925 and temporarily retreated
                    from the cultural spotlight, but that they had not disappeared and were not dormant.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Cadle's career serves as a prime example. After a string of failures and
                    embarrassments in the mid-1920s, he rebounded in the 1930s to achieve his greatest success as a
                    full-time evangelist. His life was, in brief, a microcosm of fundamentalism's resilience in
                    American culture. <list type="footnotes">

                    on August 25, 1884. From the very beginning, he recounts, he knew himself to be different from other
                    children: "I was always full of energy and wanted to get a ‘bang’ out
                    of life. I started that way very early in life. I always wanted to ride the wildest horse we had,

                            sufficient agreement permits working definitions of these substantially overlapping camps.
                            Evangelicals believe in the importance of a conversion experience to the Christian life, as
                            well as the efficacy of Jesus's death in making human redemption possible. In
                            addition, they stress the importance of the Bible as the ultimate source of wisdom and the
                            preeminent guide to human conduct. To this core belief system, fundamentalists add an
                            unwavering commitment to literalism in biblical interpretation; a premillennialist
                            eschatology, which predicts an imminent, apocalyptic battle between the forces of good and
                            evil; and a strong separatist impulse, which moves them to perpetually identify and
                            stigmatize "impurities" both within the Christian tradition and the wider
                            culture. Mark Noll adds a "zealous defense of an idealized nineteenth-century
                            American Christianity" as a defining feature of the fundamentalist tradition. Cadle
                            fits comfortably within both camps, which I occasionally group together as

                    they eventually persuaded one to conduct meetings, the results were spectacular: "an
                    old-fashioned revival broke out which lasted six weeks, and which brought into the Kingdom
                    practically the entire neighborhood. Men who had threatened to take the lives of other men, locked
                    arms and sang together, ‘What a Friend We Have in Jesus.’"

            <p>Despite his parents' example, Cadle resisted conversion during the revival. Nor, despite his
                    family's hopes, did he convert at any time during the remaining years of his youth.
                    Instead, he began dabbling in the vices that would dominate his adolescence. He cadged his first
                    drink from men in a local saloon at the age of twelve-"[f]rom the very first, I loved the
                    taste and effect of liquor"-and learned to play poker with friends, "using grains
                    of corn for poker chips."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>Late in his teenage years, Cadle met his future wife, Ola Collier, a telephone operator, and
                    "I had occasion to go through the exchange many times." In December 1904, they
                    married: he was twenty, she was seventeen. They settled briefly on his father's farm, but
                    after a cycle of planting and harvesting Cadle longed for bigger things. He and Ola moved west,
                    settling in 1905 in <placeName>

                    I met some acquaintances which were not conducive to building character." Cadle joined his
                    friends at local saloons after work and began drinking heavily. But his drinking proved less severe
                    a problem than his carousing or gambling. "There is a fascination to gambling," he
                    wrote. "I would rather my boy become a drunkard than a gambler." After staying
                    about a year in Okalahoma City-long enough to lose "the respect and confidence of many

                    beautiful girls, and it was not long until they had the proceeds of my business, and I finally lost
                    the fine saloon." He later returned to the saloon he had once owned to wash dishes for
                    $9 a week, until he was fired and was "kicked out the back door" for
                    his lax work ethic.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>A doctor's diagnosis that Cadle suffered from Bright's disease (infection of the
                    kidneys) culminated this string of reverses. Given six months to live, Cadle found himself with
                    "[n]o friends, no money; and sentenced to die." He decided to return home to
                    "see if mother would take me back." Though his father had banned him from the
                    farm, Cadle's mother "gathered me into her arms tenderly, covered my swollen face
                    with her kisses, and I thought I was resting in an angel's arms. ... I never got such
                    tender treatment from any human being as I did that day from mother." They prayed together
                    through the afternoon but "no relief seemed to come to my soul, and so all through the
                    night I prayed. When morning came, the load was not lifted yet." He went downstairs, where
                    his mother "persuaded me to lie down on her bed," and soon fell asleep. When he
                    awoke, the world seemed suddenly, strangely new-and he felt like a new man: "[A] 11 the
                    beauty of heaven seemed to burst into the windows. The old, dead apple tree seemed to be in full
                    bloom and I could hear the rustle of the wings of angels of mercy. My sins were washed away! I arose
                    as my conversion dawned on me and started to greet my mother, but I did not need to say a word, I
                    leaped into her arms. ‘It's done, it's done, the great transaction is

            <p>Such is the essence of Howard Cadle's conversion story as recounted in his autobiography. It
                    happened in March 1914, when he was twenty-nine and almost exactly at the midpoint of his life. It
                    became the narrative touchstone to which he would persistently point, in print and in person,
                    throughout his life.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> "Without modesty," as one obituary
                    writer put it, "he would depict his past as a drunkard, wastrel and professional gambler,

            <p>BIRTH OF A SALESMAN (1914-1921)</p>
            <p>In the years following his conversion, Cadle worked primarily as a salesman. He began with a job
                    selling suits and then found work for the National Biscuit Company making $30 a week.
                    "The following Sunday morning," he recalled, "we went to Sunday school
                    and church. I had $3 for the work of the Lord .... My health was much better,
                        too."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> As his health continued to improve, his network of contacts
                    broadened and he became one the company's top salesmen. In addition to biscuits, Cadle
                    began selling automobiles, and he did so well that he was appointed the sales manager of a
                    dealership, which he and a business partner soon bought out. In 1916, a sales visit to a dingy
                    shoe-repair store sparked a dream of "a nice shop, a large shop, with plenty of waiting
                    rooms for those who wanted shoe repairs made ‘on the spot,’" located
                    in "the very heart of the city." He proposed the idea to his partner, and soon
                    "we opened up the first high-class shoe repair shop in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." It proved such a success that he decided to buy out his partner and pursue
                    shoe repair full-time. With the help of a loan from Governor James Goodrich, he expanded the
                    business into a chain; by the end of 1918, he <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Cadle's salesmanship skills were confirmed by those who knew him. "I always said

                    announced that it was "erected by E. Howard Cadle in honor of his mother, whose prayers
                    saved him from a gambler's and a drunkard's grave." A local newspaper

                    interdenominational choir of 1,000 people was assembled, and another 1,000 people took part in a
                    training program "regarding the best methods of leading men and women into fellowship with
                    Jesus Christ." In the booklet published to commemorate the revival, one local pastor wrote
                    that Smith came to the city "with the best atmosphere ever created by Christian people in

                    ministers and city leaders, including Cadle, who had chaired the event's building

            </p>
            <p>The revival opened the following day, Sunday, at 2:30 p.m. in a temporary tabernacle built at the
                    intersection of <placeName>

                    evening services that day, the building was filled to its 7,500-person capacity. The revival
                    continued every night for four weeks, and its effect on the city was electric. Nearing the end of
                    the third week, 8,000 "decision cards" had been signed by attendees. About 1,000
                    claimed a conversion experience; the remainder were "re-consecrations." The
                    chairman of the YMCA committee declared in a local newspaper that the revival "has been a
                    great awakening. Our city can never again be the same. Men have had new visions, have responded to
                    higher aspirations, have rededicated themselves to a life of usefulness and service."
                    Nearly half a century later, a journalist who remembered the revival described it as a
                    "shot in the arm for the inspirational life of the community" and quoted a
                    businessman who claimed that it was "one of <placeName>

                    was announced by E. Howard Cadle, president of the choir." The purpose of the meeting was
                    to plan for the choir's future, with the goal of having it meet once a month and offer

                    Federation's earlier call for a citywide revival, Cadle explained that "this
                    tabernacle will be for the free use of all movements of cooperative Christianity in the community
                    upbuilding of the social, moral, and spiritual life of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Once built, Cadle promised, the tabernacle would be placed under the
                    leadership of a "man of national reputation."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The anchor of the Smith revival, the 1,000-person Gypsy Smith choir embodied the revival's
                    interdenominational character, drawing members from a wide variety of churches across the city. But
                    Cadle's plan to organize it on a permanent basis in a permanent revival center raised
                    suspicions. Four days after the News announcement, a front-page newspaper article in the <hi rend="i">Star</hi> announced a Methodist Preachers' Association resolution approved by
                    sixty ministers opposing the idea, "the fear being expressed that it would interfere with
                    the work of other churches in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>." The resolution announced a "consensus of opinion" that
                    "[i]nasmuch as the Gypsy Smith choir was organized out of all the cooperating churches, and
                    having accomplished its purpose, in all fairness to the churches and the choir, it should be
                    immediately disbanded. We furthermore hold that there is no need for an afternoon
                    interdenominational Sunday school or Sunday afternoon service or evening interdenominational
                    service, for such needs are abundantly met by the Y.M.C.A. men's meetings, the Y.W.C.A.,
                    the Wheeler Rescue Mission and the various churches."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methodist opposition was symbolically significant, because Methodists represented the heart of the
                    city's Protestant establishment in the early twentieth century. In 1906, nearly one-fifth
                    of all church members in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> had belonged to a Methodist church-the highest percentage claimed by any Protestant
                    denomination. But the opposition to Cadle extended far beyond that denomination. An Episcopal
                    minister told a newspaper that "it isn't fair and I think that it shows a lack of
                    genuine Christianity." A Unitarian minister observed that "if a continuance of the
                    Gypsy Smith choir promoted church unity, I should favor it, but apparently it has the opposite
                    effect. It would seem to dissipate the religious forces of the city"<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Cadle responded to his detractors with defiant incredulity. "I have never had any intention
                    of building a church around myself," he said. "I made a public statement to the
                    choir that I would never ask them to sing at the tabernacle when it would conflict with their church

            <p>Work proceeded on the building through the summer of 1921. In the days before the scheduled
                    dedication, the <hi rend="i">News</hi> reported that more than fifty workers were
                    "rushing" to have the building finished on time. "The interior ... is
                    painted old ivory and the steel supports for the roof are painted green. The pulpit is demountable,
                    thus affording a stage for pageants, plays or civic affairs." The News put the
                    project's cost, including land, at $305,000.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Completed on schedule, the building was filled to capacity during the afternoon and evening
                    dedicatory services held on October 9, and an estimated 10,000 people were turned away. Gypsy Smith
                    returned for the dedication, and memories from the spring revival played some part in the
                    attendance, but the event possessed an importance all its own. Mayor Charles Jewett, a Republican
                    close to Cadle in age and also from southern Indiana, offered to "accept, as mayor, this
                    beautiful Tabernacle from our sincere Christian citizen, E. Howard Cadle." (This was a
                    somewhat misleading sentiment, since Cadle had promised use of the building for public purposes but
                    had not actually given it to the city.) "There are always people who are skeptical, and no
                    one knows this better than a public servant," Jewett continued. "No man has ever
                    done a greater thing than has Mr. Cadle in erecting this Tabernacle. He has done a noble deed to
                    dedicate it in honor of his dear old mother, whose prayers saved him."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his part, Cadle addressed the audience briefly-describing the day as the most significant in his
                    life-and then assisted his mother onto the platform. Though too weak to give a speech, "she

                    directors presented Cadle with a contract designed to invest the board with this authority. Cadle
                    rejected it, saying the contract "would eliminate me from having any part in the program

                    Tabernacle, but he refused to honor the agreement when Cadle asserted his authority and appeared to
                    position himself in competition with local ministers. "I have for a number of years been
                    working in harmony with the organized churches," Jones said in a statement released to the
                    press, "and my conscience will not permit me to be associated with any movement which is

            <p>The availability of such a large meeting hall fit well with the plans of city politicians. As the
                    1920 city directory had proudly observed, "more cities of 30,000 population and over can be

                    auditoriums, but the largest, Tomlinson Hall, seated only 3,500.</p>

                    recently elected mayor Lew Shank, a politician who was both unimpressed with Cadle and fully his
                    equal as showman, announced that, if the proper ordinances were passed, "the city will
                    match a reasonable sum raised by sale of stock for erection of a five-story exposition
                    building." He also proposed buying the Cadle Tabernacle to meet its convention needs, an
                    idea which the Chamber rejected as inadequate. Cadle's reaction revealed the animosity that
                    marked his relationship with the new City Hall: he publicly promised choir members that they need
                    not worry about "ever having to move from this sacred spot in the Cadle tabernacle, to make
                    way for the cheap hobbies of the mayor of our city, because Mayor Lew Shank nor any one else has
                    enough money to buy my tabernacle."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shank responded the following week by instructing the city's lawyers "to find some
                    way to put Cadle Tabernacle on the tax duplicate." The religious building had been exempt
                    up to that point, but because it was now also used for secular conventions, Shank believed Cadle
                    should pay taxes on the rent he received. "I know Cadle charged us $500 to hold
                    a [Senator Albert] Beveridge meeting in the place last spring," Shank said. "I
                    guess that wasn't a religious meeting, was it?"<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

                    existed between the two organizations. But Cadle would be gone from the scene by the time the Klan
                    exerted its greatest influence in Indiana. Within weeks of the Klan's dramatic show of
                    support for him, Cadle had become involved in a dispute with the Tabernacle's board that
                    prompted his decision to leave the organization.</p>
            <p>The details of this estrangement remain as fuzzy as his Klan ties. Cadle's published
                    autobiographical version of the story cited treachery on the part of the board of directors: they
                    accused him of embezzling money from the Tabernacle offerings, then voted to oust him as the
                    organization's president. When this news reached the public, a storm of protest forced them
                    to reconsider and rescind the vote. But soon after this reconciliation, Cadle judged the Tabernacle
                    too heavy a financial burden and agreed to relinquish his controlling interest. Contemporary press
                    accounts, however, centered on the Klan and a complicated power struggle between Cadle and choir
                    director Joe Overmeyer. It "came to a showdown for the board to retain me or Mr.
                    Overmeyer," Cadle offered, "and when they refused to back me up . . . then I

            <p>In October, Cadle announced a plan to compete with his former ministry by building a new auditorium

                    Cadle's plan for a competing tabernacle came to nothing. The new leadership of his former
                    ministry carried on with Sunday afternoon and evening services, and Cadle dropped out of sight. One

            <p>Cadle spent about two years in the Tampa area, joining in a frenzy of real estate speculation that
                    journalist Frederick Lewis Allen described as "the most delirious fever of real-estate

                    came back to <placeName>

                    would run for governor in 1928 as an independent candidate. Like the mayoral bid four years earlier,
                    this plan foundered. In <hi rend="i">How I Came Back,</hi> Cadle described the change of plans as
                    submission to God's will. Again, his "conversion" took place on his
                    parents' farm. His mother, responding to the announcement of his candidacy for governor,
                    declared "I would rather have you be the poorest preacher in the state, than the best
                    Governor we ever had." The rebuke set off a night of soul-searching similar to his
                    conversion experience fifteen years earlier: "After battling until 3 o'clock in

            <p>Cadle apparently spent much time during the next several years on the road, preaching at various
                    revival meetings in the Midwest and South. In the last week of June 1931, he reemerged as an

                    bank that originally financed it.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Cadle persuaded the bank to allow him use of
                    it for several weeks, then called a series of special meetings to raise money. A newspaper announced
                    that Cadle would speak in the Tabernacle the following Sunday, with a subhead more prophetic than
                    its writer could have known: "Cadle to Tell of Comeback, Tabernacle Builder Will Relate
                    Story by Radio." Cadle announced his plan to buy back the building and restore it to its
                    original function; local radio station WFBM broadcasted the address. The <placeName>

                    citizen" and predicted that "the vast majority will undoubtedly cherish a hope
                    that he succeed." Distancing itself from Cadle's theology, the Times nonetheless
                    noted the need for "a real revival of spiritual outlook in these days of turmoil and

                    signal at 50,000 watts. By the time Cadle joined WLW's roster, the federal government had
                    authorized experimental use of a 500,000-watt transmitter. The station tested the signal throughout
                    1933; by 1934, it was approved for full-time use. President <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Central and South America, and sometimes even across the oceans. In the first six
                    months after the power upgrade, WLW's mail volume quintupled over the same period a year
                    before. In 1935, the Federal Communications Commission estimated that the station's signal
                    could be received clearly and consistently by more than ninety million people, or two-thirds of the
                    nation's population. "The nation's station," as WLW billed
                    itself, reached out to an audience eagerly embracing radio. In 1935, two-thirds of all households in
                    the U.S. had a radio; by 1941, that figure had climbed to an estimated 85 percent.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

                            fledgling ministry. Crosley liked him so much that he agreed, and Cadle's time on
                            the station remained free until his death. The story is not implausible, given
                            Cadle's salesmanship skills and their shared Republican inclinations. Dick Perry,

                    various soloists and choirs. Monday through Saturday the program aired in a fifteen-minute time slot
                    beginning at 6 a.m. On Sundays it aired from 11 to 11:30 a.m. Ola typically opened the program with
                    the hymn "Did You Think to Pray?" and closed with "Sweet Hour of
                    Prayer," while Cadle's son, Buford, introduced the program and signed it off.
                    Sometimes he announced a revival that his father would be conducting in a certain town, or described
                    a recent meeting at the Tabernacle or elsewhere. But he always introduced Cadle with the same words:
                    "Now I introduce to you your friend and my father, E. Howard Cadle."</p>
            <p>In his devotional addresses, Cadle persistently reminded his audience of the
                    "bigness" of his enterprise. The choir was "the largest permanently
                    organized chorus choir." The Tabernacle was variously "the largest religious
                    auditorium in the world" and "the world's largest religious
                    interdenominational institution." Cadle had collected these and similar grand claims, along
                    with details about the Tabernacle's history and its staff, in a brochure, which he offered
                    to anyone who requested it. "We still have a lot of booklets left yet," he noted
                    one morning at the close of the program. "If you'd like to know the story about
                    this great religious institution, the largest religious auditorium in the world with a seating
                    capacity of 10,000, built at the cost of half a million dollars through a redeemed drunkard whose
                    mother's prayers saved him, we'll send you one free of charge."<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

            <p>It is impossible to know exactly how many people listened to the show or responded to
                    Cadle's booklet offers and pleas for money. Whatever records were kept are now gone, and
                    the extant reports are of uncertain reliability. Life noted in 1939 that the WLW audience
                    "floods his office with 4,000 letters weekly." In a memoir published in 1957, a
                    Cadle friend and associate estimated that in 1934 the Tabernacle had received 24,000 letters a
                    month, a volume that required the attention of twenty staff members. A writer for Radio Guide in
                    1939 described the Tabernacle as "the spiritual center" of thirty million
                        Christians.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

                    family, the Tabernacle also served as a connection to a world beyond Alleghany County-a glimpse of a
                    better tomorrow. "It's hard to identify with what I'm saying [if you
                    didn't live through the Depression]," she recalled, more than half a century
                    later. The daily Tabernacle broadcast "was a breath of fresh air. It was a touch of the

                    a small airplane, and Buford served as his pilot. After the morning show, they and several members
                    of the staff would fly to various locations in the Midwest and the South, hold a service that

            <p>Cadle called another effort to broaden his audience "mountain church work."
                    Beginning in 1937, Cadle put Arnold to work installing radio receivers in isolated and sometimes
                    abandoned churches throughout the upper South, generally in Appalachian communities too small or too
                    poor to support a full-time preacher. With a Crosley radio (also donated) installed in the building,
                    people could meet together on Sunday mornings and feel part of a regular worship service.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Arnold's son often traveled with his father. He later recalled that they would leave <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName> early on Saturday mornings and be away until late Sunday evening. "Half of the
                    churches, something would keep you from getting all the way to them," he said.
                    "The road would run out. Sometimes, the church people would be there with mules. These were
                    dirt roads, so if it rained there was no getting through with a car." Arnold kept a log of
                    his journeys, and the fragmented entries register the poverty and challenges he encountered.
                    "Abandoned mining camp leased by the county, Logan, for folks on relief," read an

                    broadcast each Sunday.</p>
            <p>Cadle's success rode upon the strong loyalty of his audience. A pianist who played at the
                    Tabernacle in the early 1930s said of the Gypsy Smith choir: "They adored him, really.
                    There was something that just pulled. There was just a tightness of fellowship,
                    friendship." Though widely scattered, his radio audience felt the same pull of love and
                    loyalty. Lonely widows like "Mrs. L. P." tuned in every morning knowing that
                    others did the same. And on Sundays, people across the Appalachian South gathered in small churches,
                    seated before a radio attached to a pulpit, and heard the Cadle Tabernacle choir singing familiar
                    gospel hymns. "He is <list type="footnotes">

                    of the <hi rend="i">Radio Guide</hi> piece on Cadle concluded. "He could live to be as old
                    as Methuselah and never touch the surface of the millions he reaches now through a microphone on his
                    pulpit, which makes the world his parish."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cadle's radio success finally made plausible his claim of not competing with local
                    churches-but not because the Tabernacle sat empty. Indeed, several thousand people attended the
                    Sunday morning broadcast each week, and the Tabernacle also held a Sunday evening service.
                    Attendance at both of these meetings was greater than that at the vast majority of churches in the
                    city and, Cadle's protests notwithstanding, the Tabernacle gave every appearance of being a
                    church: it took an offering, baptized people, held communion services regularly, and sponsored clubs
                    and organizations that catered to one's age or interests.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> But in
                    truth, the importance of this local audience diminished dramatically when Cadle began his radio
                    broadcasts. His competition now consisted primarily of other radio personalities, secular and
                    sacred.</p>
            <p>At the same time, though, the importance of the Tabernacle itself increased. As home to "The
                    Nation's Family Prayer Period," it soon became a sort of shrine, a place of
                    pilgrimage. Curt Davis, who served as the Tabernacle's organist from 1931 until
                    Cadle's death, recalled that the 6 a.m. weekday broadcasts typically included 200 or 300
                    people in the audience. Always, he said, the parking lot was filled with out-of-state cars. People
                    came to see a radio star, to see the "largest building of its kind in the world,"
                    and on Sundays to see the famous choir. "See, this is before television," Davis
                    said, "You can tell the listening audience that they're hearing 1,200 people sing,
                    or that they're hearing 1,000 people sing. They would say, T don't believe it.
                    I'm going to go see.' So, when he had visitors stand . . . sometimes that took ten
                    or fifteen minutes [after the broadcast]. He would call off the states: 'Who's
                    here from <placeName>

            <p>Cadle's activity in Belleville, a community about fifteen miles west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, provides perhaps the best evidence of his economic success. In the mid-1930s, he
                    bought a large home, several small homes, and more than one thousand acres of land there. He used
                    the land to graze animals and grow crops and lodged his farmhands and their families in the smaller
                    homes as part of their pay. In a note written to William Arnold in October 1937, after a recent
                    illness had briefly sidelined him, Cadle said that "I have made a mighty important decision
                    since being back. I am through with all outside business, and am going to take care of the farm ....
                    No more business; no more saw mills; no more veneer mills; no more plants; no more timber; no more
                    nothing! . . . You know the old devil was trying to get me off on the wrong track with so much
                    business that it would take my mind off winning souls for Christ, but I caught the old cuss just in

            </p>
            <p>The promise proved impossible to keep. Four months later, a local newspaper reported that "a
                    new saw mill which, when completed, will provide employment for 25 to 30 men, is being built by E.
                    Howard Cadle at Belleville, five miles west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plainfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the National Road." To supply the mill with wood, Cadle also bought two
                    eighty-acre tracts of virgin timber in another town. "The mill is equipped with all modern

                            the income derived almost exclusively from pleas for donations on his radio program; there

            <p>In addition to these ventures, Cadle constructed in Belleville a log tabernacle with a seating
                    capacity of 5,000. The tabernacle stood as the centerpiece of a summer campground that included open
                    land for parking trailers and pitching tents, a restaurant, cabins, and small man-made lakes for
                    fishing and swimming. Each summer, he invited evangelists from around the nation to be guest
                    speakers in the log tabernacle, and he invited his radio and print audience to spend their vacation
                    at the Cadle campgrounds. In July 1936, a local newspaper reported that the tabernacle's
                    dedication service "was completely filled, and the remaining heard the sermon through an
                    amplifying system on the meeting grounds."<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

            <p>By 1942 Cadle's varied pursuits-local and far-flung, business and religious-functioned in
                    perfect symbiosis. On Sundays, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, heard the morning service
                    broadcast live from the Cadle Tabernacle. On weekdays and Saturdays, many listeners started their
                    day with his 15-minute devotional. Some drove to <placeName>

                    summer campground. For many of those unable to see him in person, Cadle brought his ministry to
                    their town through one-night revivals. This vast audience showed their thanks by sending Cadle
                    money, which he used to build and expand both his business and religious endeavors.</p>
            <p>Given more time, this symbiotic setup might have propelled Cadle to truly national significance.
                    World War II, perhaps even more so than the Depression, created a powerful demand for the sort of
                    soothing tonic that Cadle offered. But little more than a year after the U.S. entered the war, his
                    ministry abruptly ended. One morning in October 1942, after delivering what would be his final

            <p>E. HOWARD CADLE's APPEAL: POPULISM, PRAGMATISM, AND SUPERNATURALISM</p>
            <p>In the decades since Cadle's death, Americans have seen many others of his ilk ascend to
                    fame: the charismatic radio or television preacher with a gift for salesmanship, a large and loyal
                    base of supporters, a vague or nonexistent denominational affiliation, and an ambiguous identity
                    that is equal parts businessperson and believer. The same character type has a long history in the
                    annals of American religion-one can trace it back at least to George Whitefield and his massive
                    outdoor revival meetings, over the protests of "regular" clergy, in the
                    mid-eighteenth-century American colonies.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Cadle's significance to
                    historians stems from the fact that he appeared on the scene-and achieved widespread popular
                    success-precisely at a moment when modern science and culture threatened the moorings of traditional
                    religion and morality.</p>
            <p>Cadle presented two personas to his audience-a Savvy Businessman and a Country Preacher-and created a
                    productive tension out of the contradictions between them by relying on an intensely literal
                    supernaturalism. His ability to harmonize divergent images-to embrace traditional and modern, urban
                    and rural-offers a model of the strategies that conservative Christians used to resist and adapt to
                    broad religious and cultural changes in the decades after the 1920s.</p>
            <p>Cadle's theology and his interpretive approach emphasized a literal, "common
                    sense" understanding of scripture: all believers who approached the Bible in good faith,
                    taking its words literally, would <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">70</hi> Ola Cadle served as president of the Tabernacle's board of
                            trustees until her death in July 1955. The Tabernacle began a television ministry in the
                            early 1950s, but it never achieved the sort of success that the radio program enjoyed under
                            Howard Cadle. The last issue of the <hi rend="i">Cadle Call</hi> appeared in October 1967.
                            After the Tabernacle was sold off and torn down the following year, only the radio ministry
                            survived. It eventually became a weekly program conducted by an out-of-state preacher. The
                            show finally ceased broadcasting in the early 1990s after the deaths of the Cadle children,
                            Buford and Helen, who managed it.</item>

                    and Noah and his family were the only survivors of a universal flood. As for humanity's
                    origins, Cadle stated, "I do not believe man was made through the process of evolution. I
                    believe God made man from a pile of dirt, because the Bible says so, and I have sense enough to
                    believe the Bible." God was also intimately involved in people's individual and
                    collective fate: "God will not stand for the rampant, sinfulness of our nation today, but
                    He will bring down fire from heaven to wipe out creation, unless men and women are willing to
                    forsake the devil and turn to Him."<hi rend="sup">73</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the context of Cadle's rise to evangelistic success in the 1930s, this theological
                    supernaturalism bore a crucial social message. "God has brought on this economic depression
                    to make a lot of people realize there is more to life than prosperity," Cadle preached. In
                    another sermon he denied that "we will ever solve any problems until we do it in the name
                    of Jesus Christ. Now, I mean all problems-our economic, our social, our educational, and our
                    religious. They <hi rend="i">all</hi> have to be solved at the foot of the cross .... The Bible
                    tells me so, and I see where people cannot solve problems other places, other ways, or through
                    different mediums." Human effort alone might be useless, but the believer who surrendered
                    to God's will discovered a newfound power that dramatically enhanced personal prospects in
                    every endeavor. In a sermon titled "The Reason I Am a Christian," Cadle explained
                    that "when one is a Christian and is born into the Kingdom of God, He will hear our prayers
                    for health, money, job, sweetheart, home, and every phase of our life." Another sermon
                    offered that "[d]ivorces, home troubles, family differ-ences and quarrels, and economic
                    distress can be avoided if men and women would accept the peace and power of Jesus Christ in their
                    daily lives. Jesus Christ is the truest friend of man in all of his troubles and is the best
                    business partner today."<hi rend="sup">74</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This intertwining of pragmatism and supernaturaJism characterized the part of Cadle's public

            <p>In Depression-era America, the Savvy Businessman persona presented serious pitfalls, especially given
                    Cadle's expensive tastes and his unembarrassed displays of wealth. Cadle mitigated the
                    contradiction with another image characterized by his nickname for himself: "the Country
                    Preacher." The Country Preacher set rural, "traditional" values over the
                    vices of the cities. "Country" also signified "community." In
                    his conversion story, Cadle descended into sin-and his social networks fell apart-when he first
                    ventured into big cities. Back in his parents' home, on a farm in southern Indiana, he
                    found cosmic redemption and restoration to an earthly community. His mother, who would accept him no
                    matter how far he fell, symbolized all the traditional values that had defined Cadle's
                    nineteenth-century boyhood, and her embrace served as a gesture of unconditional acceptance and
                    love-precisely those things that the city and its vices had stripped away. Thus the
                    "Country" in Cadle's self-description resonated on both literal and
                    metaphorical levels: where he came from, and the place of eternal communion.</p>
            <p>The Country Preacher also practiced an aggressive populism.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> A eulogy appearing
                    in a local paper after Cadle's death noted that he was "a highly unusual
                    man" who "had the gift of knowing his people."<hi rend="sup">77</hi> The
                    reference to Cadle's "people" hints at something difficult to quantify
                    but nonetheless real: the class tensions underlying his success. It is <list type="footnotes">

                    downtrodden, but it is beyond doubt that his followers felt deeply vulnerable. The legal name he
                    gave to his evangelistic work-the People's Church, Inc.-nderscored the populist thrust of
                    his ministry.<hi rend="sup">78</hi> Like the People's Party of the 1890s, Cadle identified
                    a group of elites as the source of the nation's problems, but instead of challenging the
                    moneyed elite of the Gilded Age, the Country Preacher charged elitists of the mind-intellectuals and

                    cram your little, old head full of all the knowledge of the books of the world," Cadle

                    will never do it there. You will never do it in the name of science .... Science, psychology,
                    physiology-all the ologies in the world will not solve the problems. I solved all my problems on my

                    Businessman lived in the city and dressed like a dandy, the Country Preacher reassured listeners
                    that he remained a farm boy at heart. The Savvy Businessman understood the push and shove of the
                    modern world; he played by its rules and was rewarded with a Cadillac and an airplane. The farm boy
                    could conquer the city so long as he cultivated self-discipline, resisted the lure of city vices,
                    relied on God's help, and stayed true to the simple truths of the Bible. Cadle's
                    life offered proof that the transi-tion from a rural to an urban society need not mean the end of
                    morality and traditional values.<hi rend="sup">82</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Radio's rapid rise allowed Cadle to promote his "country" values from an
                    urban headquarters. That irony takes us to the heart of the religious right's
                    persistence-and influence-in modern American culture. Cadle's radio program provided his
                    listeners with a sense of connection to a wider, albeit largely invisible, world of like-minded
                        people.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> "I do not know how I could carry on some days if it was
                    not for the morning prayer period to give me strength to keep on trying and trust[ing] in
                    God," read one letter from a listener, reprinted in Cadle's monthly magazine.
                    Another wrote that "our entire family (wife and five kiddies and self) are using your
                    family prayer period as a foundation for our family altar. You'll never know this side of
                    the pearly gates just what your life has meant to me and millions of others."<hi rend="sup">84</hi> As the leader of a vast community knitted together by radio during a time of economic
                    desperation and social turbulence, Cadle reassured his audience that God controlled their fate and
                    the fate of the nation. The politicians and their advisers, the intellectuals and the
                    technocrats-all were impotent in the face of the nation's problems. The only cure was
                    God's grace, and the only path to that was through prayer and repentance. In true populist
                    fashion, Cadle's message of hope gave power to the people.</p>

            <p>Across the nation, scores of Cadle's contemporary American revivalists engaged in similar
                    sorts of regionalized community building.Aimee Semple McPherson's evangelistic career in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> spanned roughly the same years as Cadle's. Her supernatural faith healings
                    could hardly have launched a more direct affront to the rising naturalism of modernity. A skilled
                    self-promoter and entertainer, McPherson used her flamboyant personality and energetic sermons to
                    keep radio audiences spellbound. In 1924, she began broadcasting from radio station KFSG, located in
                    her institutional headquarters, the Angelus Temple. The sta-tion's reach was vast: live
                    broadcasts from the Temple made McPherson's voice "one of the most familiar in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." When an earth-quake struck Santa Barbara in 1925 her listeners demonstrated
                    vividly the community-building aspect of her work by responding to her pleas for assistance and
                    delivering two convoys of aid before the Red Cross could deploy its own relief efforts. The thriving
                    denomination she built, the Foursquare Church, survives to this day<hi rend="sup">85</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like McPherson, E. Howard Cadle is important, in the end, because his blend of pragmatism, populism,
                    and supernaturalism presaged the emerging character of conservative Christianity in America. In the
                    1930s, when fundamentalists were tempted by their theology and the verdict of Scopes to isolate
                    themselves and reject American culture as corrupt beyond hope, Cadle took the opposite tack. He
                    often quarreled with more "mainstream" religious and community leaders, but he
                    never withdrew into silence. Indeed, he relished being at the center of conflict and controversy,
                    and he always sustained an active engagement with the culture in which he operated. In building his
                    institution, he drew on the sense of betrayal and powerlessness felt by millions of Americans who
                    had watched their communities fragment and their "old-fashioned" faith come under
                    withering attack by scientific and humanistic scholarship. But he played on more than their despair.
                    Like scores of other charismatic Christian leaders, he offered a positive alternative: a
                    "community" of like-minded believers-a support network- <list type="footnotes">

                    Christianity, but not the strategies of resistance. Countless preachers and politicians of a
                    conservative bent followed the familiar paradigm, decrying the nation's fall from grace
                    while exhorting the nation's "pro-moral" majority to fight back against

            <p>As it happens, Howard Cadle played an important, if vicarious, role in that resurgence. After his
                    death, his young assistant and "disciple" B. R. Lakin stayed on as
                    "pastor" of the Tabernacle and hosted the radio show until 1952. Lakin, a West
                    Virginian who possessed a folksy appeal similar to that of his mentor, went on to his own career as
                    a renowned revivalist in fundamentalist circles. In the 1960s, he mentored a young Jerry Falwell.
                    Howard Cadle might have relished the prescience of his autobiography's title, How I Came
                    Back. His own existence has nearly been forgotten. But in spirit, if not in flesh, the Country

            <p>During the summer of 1924 the Ku Klux Klan carried out four distinct aggressive actions in the
                    northern Indiana town of North Judson. I was a lad of ten years at the time; I watched two of these
                    events unfold before my eyes and I witnessed the evidence of the others in the days that followed. A
                    fiery cross, a public parade, a homemade bomb, and open vandalism-these acts threatened all of the
                    Catholics in our community, and, for me, left scars that have not been erased in the intervening
                    eight decades. Midway through high school I left North Judson behind, but though I graduated from
                    Purdue University, moved to the East Coast, and worked a lifelong career as an engineer, the
                    memories remain.</p>
            <p>I have never really discussed the incidents with anyone, although I have, on occasion, reminisced for
                    the benefit of my own four children. <list type="footnotes">

                    came to fruition. Some years ago I felt that I should check my own memory, and I hired a person to
                    comb the Starke County newspapers for any shred of documentation of the incidents. She turned up a
                    small amount of additional information but nothing at variance with my memory.</p>
            <p>Having myself annotated two family histories written by my ancestors, I know that such recollections
                    can in fact be accurate, particularly when they concern important events that have become firmly
                    embedded in a person's mind.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This, I believe, is the case with my
                    memories of the Klan in North Judson. I knew these people; I delivered newspapers to their doors; I
                    went to high school with their children. In face-to-face encounters I never felt threatened by them;
                    yet their public acts were committed behind a veil of secrecy.</p>
            <p>Speaking of Indiana's Klan-marked past, one <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> resident concluded that "You can't burn history."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> As Omar Khayyam writes, such tragedies of the past cannot be washed away with
                    tears either. My purpose is neither to cry nor to condemn. I present these incidents only to record
                    a bit of history not yet put to print. In so doing, I stress the deliberate and vicious nature of
                    the Klan's activities in my home town.</p>
            <p>Shortly before the time of my birth, a Starke County historian had pointed to "the spirit of
                    progress" that typified the area in its early days. Beginning with a first white settler
                    and first white child (1835), county boosters traced a line of development through a sawmill (1849),
                    county organization (1850), and the founding of the towns of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> (1850) and North Judson (1860). Soon, four different rail lines-the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s better-known gangsters slipped out of the city for high jinks, bootlegging,
                    and gambling at English Lake, a crossroads community on the Kankakee River in the northern part of
                    the county, and at Bass Lake, a few miles east of North Judson.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Three miles to the southeast of town, meanwhile, the C &amp; O built a station in the Lena Park
                    development, which boosters touted as a "new manufacturing Center" that would
                    "becom[e] a Great City only surpassed by the World's most rapid growth town, Gary,

                    </placeName> provided free rides to persons wishing to escape the city for a chance to purchase one
                    of "thousands of lots" spread across more than 2,000 acres. The bubble burst when
                    manufacturers determined that the local sands were ill-suited for the cutglass factory originally

            <p>These new ethnic immigrants brought their Catholic faith with them. By the turn of the century their
                    numbers were sufficient to support a parish. This first church had been located in San Pierre, with
                    the priests administering to the North Judson members on a mission basis. With time this situation
                    was reversed, and North Judson became the more populated part of the parish.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> By
                    the end of the first decade of the twentieth century there were enough Catholics in the North Judson
                    area to finance a large church-Saints Cyril and Methodius-and a moderately-sized parochial school.
                    The former is still in use. The latter, a four-room, two-story brick edifice, has been razed in
                    recent years and a new building constructed at another location. Built near the parsonage and the
                    home of the teaching nuns (four or five Sisters of the St. Francis Order), the structures created a
                    close-knit Catholic compound one block from North Judson's main street.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> were (or became) well-to-do families who did not fit readily into the category of
                    "poor immigrant." Catholic immigrants soon owned the town's major general
                    store (Two Joes, owned and operated by Joseph Dolezal and Joseph Sindelar), the Chrysler dealer
                    (Frank Vessely), and the major cafe and ice cream parlor (the Picchetti family), among other
                    businesses.</p>
            <p>1 knew of no blacks in the town. The only Jews, to my knowledge, were the Donchin family. Born in
                    Russia, Ben Donchin and his family had emigrated from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to North Judson. He and his two sons owned and operated the town's major
                    men's clothing store.</p>
            <p>My father descended from a long line of WASPs, while my mother descended from an equally long line of
                    Irish Catholics. Upon their marriage, my father converted to Roman Catholicism. Both of my parents
                    practiced the tenets, in the broad sense, throughout their lifetimes. I cannot recall ever having
                    heard a bigoted remark from either. They had five sons, of whom I was the second-born. My older
                    brother was smarter, larger, and more vocal. I did a lot of listening at the dinner table.</p>
            <p>The Klan exercised a direct impact on our family and, although I was not much more than a child, I
                    knew about it. For almost a full decade before their marriage, both of my parents had taught
                    elementary school in the one- and two-room schools of Indiana. Later, my father <list type="footnotes">

                    result of the 1922 Railroad Township trustees‘ election-in which Leonard Rennewanz
                    replaced Dr. W. J. Solt-my father suddenly found himself to be of the wrong religion and he was
                    summarily dropped. This first jolt from the KKK sent us to North Judson, where my father ceased
                    teaching and began to look for work in construction. Difficulties continued, but there were enough
                    Catholic families with building and maintenance needs to keep our collective heads above water.</p>
            <p>When we moved from English Lake to North Judson, my parents enrolled us in the public school. I spent
                    a number of weeks in a singlegrade classroom and thus became acquainted with some of the public
                    school children. Following pressure from our priest, however, and much to my dismay, my parents
                    transferred us to the four-room parochial school.</p>
            <p>There was no formal interaction between we parochial school children and our public school
                    counterparts, but we did have mixed group activities. A vacant lot on my end of town drew all of us
                    to play baseball. Promoters of the Enterprise Development project had laid out streets and planted
                    trees before the bust forced them to halt. Any available children played in the "work
                    up" sandlot baseball games. We formed a team (named after the failed land project) and
                    played another team from the north end of town. In addition to baseball, bicycling and the
                    construction and use of hoops and wheels brought boys of differing backgrounds together after school
                    hours. We boys also belonged to the same community-wide Boy Scout troop. I remember that one big
                    event was a weeklong campout at newly opened Schaffer Lake-at that time, still filled with stumps.</p>
            <p>My acquaintance with public school children continued when I was hired as a weed puller in the onion
                    fields. The muck lands of Starke County were very productive for truck farming, and there were many
                    acres planted in onions, carrots, and mint. Each hot summer day, my employer, a Japanese man,
                    trucked ten to fifteen boys and girls to crawl up and down rows of growing onions for the purpose of
                    pulling errant weeds but leaving the tender onions. (Although I didn't realize it at the
                    time, the salary of 20 cents per hour was more than I would earn for quite a few years as we
                    approached the Great Depression.) During those long and tiring days, a certain amount of comradeship
                    developed out of the commonality of our burdens.</p>
            <p>We boys also found the railroad to be an endless source of adventure. The four major lines, with
                    their switching yards and repair shops, <pb n="344" id="VAA4025-102-4-054"/> took up a significant
                    part of the town. The elder boys of our group would occasionally hop on the side ladder of a freight
                    car as it made a slow start-up; I was too small to participate. Another occasional interest was the
                    collection of "babbitt"-a low-melting-point alloy from the overheated journal
                    bearings of freight car wheels that had various uses by schoolboy experimenters. Our main interest
                    came in trying to flatten pennies by placing them on the rails in front of an advancing engine. This
                    brought us into contact with the railroad detectives who chased us away from the vicinity of the
                    tracks. These men patrolled the extensive railroad yards of the town; we held them in great respect
                    as on one or more occasions they had shot a hobo trespasser. The alley on the side yard of our
                    school was the route for accessing the rear entrance to the funeral parlor that held one of these
                    bodies. With some stealth and a certain amount of courage, it was possible for young lads to
                    approach this rear entrance and peak through a window into the layout room.</p>
            <p>We also respected Louis Danti, the town marshal. He was an Italian immigrant and a member of our
                    church. Danti had a large number of children with, apparently, no mother. One of the boys, Joe, was
                    in my room at school. Louis patrolled the town's main business area after dark and into the
                    early hours of morning. The local Ku Klux Klan purported to control lawlessness, and I was aware
                    that the Horse Thief Detective Association had some connection with the Klan (at least this was what
                    I understood). However, in North Judson there was very little that could be considered lawless-until
                    the night of the shootout.</p>
            <p>Donchin's Men's Clothing Store had a recessed entrance with numerous plate-glass
                    windows, behind which stood dummies clothed with Hart Schaffner &amp; Marx suits. It was within
                    this almost closed area that Louis Danti surprised a burglar who drew on him. Louis immedi-ately
                    pulled his own gun and fired at the burglar, who escaped. This was Louis's story, and there
                    were holes in the plate-glass windows to prove it. However, there were also unkind murmurs to the
                    effect that Louis had really shot at his own reflection.</p>
            <p>The physical embodiment of law and order was the town jail, located in the basement of a brick
                    building that also housed the water-works on the first floor, and the fire department on the second.
                    (From this height, the town's single fire engine exited via a long ramp.) Whenever the jail
                    held a prisoner-which was seldom-its ground-level barred windows could also be approached in a
                    somewhat stealthy manner at dusk, and, if the lights were on, we could see into the cell and with
                    quick glances examine the inmate.</p>

            <p>In a public lot adjacent to this jail, at the corner of Keller Avenue and Main Street, the Klan
                    committed its first public act of Catholic intimidation. Here, next to the nunnery, they erected two
                    timbers or tree limbs configured as a cross of Christ. The two crossed posts were wrapped with
                    burlap or some other cheap cloth, doused with kerosene, and set on fire. In the dead of night it was
                    a spectacular sight. Across the street from a vacant jail, the charred structure stood for several
                    days as a stern reminder of law and order, Klan style.</p>
            <p>Several days later, the town's only newspaper, the weekly <hi rend="i">North Judson
                    News,</hi> used the word "orderly" to describe the Klan's next act-an
                    impressive parade routed down the extent of Lane Street and then onto Main Street, which began after

                  <p>The Catholic parsonage at North Judson was dynamited about 12:15 A. M., Tuesday morning and
                            considerable damage done. The bomb or whatever it was, was thrown through the glass door to
                            the screened in porch and when it exploded, the glass in the doors and windows of the house
                            were broken, a big hole was torn in the cement porch and other damage done.</p>
                  <p>Extract from the <hi rend="i">Starke County Democrat,</hi> July 30, 1924</p>
               </figure> classmate, Ralph Dolezal. I remember companies of marchers in white robes topped with the
                    conical white hats and masks that covered their faces. These were preceded by numbers of similarly
                    costumed members mounted on horses. Many were carrying flaming torches that added emphasis to the
                    eerie and threatening spectacle. More than anything else, however, the most striking and impressive
                    part of the parade was a float of a public school building. The attached labeling-which read
                    "Little Red Schoolhouse"-left no doubt as to what was being targeted: our
                    parochial school! To a ten-year-old schoolboy, this was a body blow.</p>
            <p>The third act took place five days later, in the early morning hours of July 29, when an explosion
                    rocked the home of our resident priest, Father A. C. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Rie. He and the housekeeper, Mary McNeal, both awoke to the sound of shattering glass
                    and headed to the door. The housekeeper, who reached the entrance first, was just opening the door
                    as the bomb exploded. "Every glass window in the front of the porch and front of the house
                    was broken to 'smithereens' and several windows in other parts of the house were
                    also broken," the News reported. "The front doors were blown completely off their
                    hinges and much of the <pb n="347" id="VAA4025-102-4-057"/> siding on the building was torn into
                    shreds. The ceiling was also badly damaged and a mass of glass was scattered throughout the house
                    and yard."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The housekeeper suffered serious lacerations from the
                    flying glass, but the priest-the attackers' likely target-remained physically unharmed.</p>
            <p>Every boy knew that the bomb was surely a stick or two of dynamite. The materials for such an
                    explosive-dynamite, a mercury fulminate detonator (called a cap), and a length of fuse line-were
                    available at many of the farmsteads of rural Indiana. I have seen these items put together many
                    times to blow out tree stumps. Using a pencil, a stick, or a knife, one made a hole and inserted the
                    detonator into the end of the dynamite. One end of the detonator-a copper cylinder about one-fourth
                    inch in diameter and two inches long-was hollowed out for insertion of the fuse. These detonators
                    were so common in North Judson that they were used as trade goods among school boys. I once came
                    into possession of one and carried it around in my pocket for several days. Eventually we fired it
                    by rolling it up in a newspaper, lighting the paper, and running like mad for safety. A bomb left on
                    a doorstep, however, leaves nowhere to run.</p>
            <p>Several weeks later, in the early fall of 1924, vandals marred the stonework at the entrance to
                    Saints Cyril and Methodius. This fourth incident may seem inconsequential in light of the earlier
                    violence, but when I went up the steps to attend morning mass I felt that I was walking through a
                    battlefield. Large spheres of stone, broken pieces of concrete, and other detritus were scattered
                    over the steps to the entryway.</p>
            <p>These four incidents seemed to have been orchestrated in their timing and gradation of violence and
                    viciousness: flaming timbers in a public lot, followed by the parade of robed marchers at dusk,
                    emphasized by the explosion at the parsonage, and capped off by the effacement of our church
                    building. If the explosion and vandalism were not planned components of the intimidation campaign,
                    they were, at minimum, encouraged by the emotions generated by the parade. In my mind it was
                    patently clear that the Klan was the underlying cause, if not the direct perpetrator, of these
                    hate-filled acts. I also knew that, by targeting my school and my church, the Klan aimed at me.</p>

            <p>The events of the summer of 1924 became an issue in our home. At the outset, my mother had played
                    down the burning cross as being of little importance. She could not continue to do so in the wake of
                    the parade, the bombing, and the vandalism. Although the events were not really discussed, a sense
                    of direness passed from parents to children without the necessity of words.</p>
            <p>The incidents seem never to have been discussed by the nun in our classroom-at least I have no
                    recollection of such. Nor do I recall any mention by the priest during Sunday masses. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> Rie possessed a commanding presence-one that certainly displayed itself on those
                    occasions when he stood at the front of the class-room as a higher authority for major classroom
                    crimes. I think that by the time of the Klan episodes he had had considerable experience with
                    bigots. Also, he ministered to a large parish of two communities, many of whose members had stature
                    in their own right. This must have given him the courage to downplay these vicious acts in a spirit
                    of charity and to maintain the goodwill of the mainstream of the town. He was an important and
                    significant member of the community. When he was transferred to a larger parish a few years later,
                    he left with the town's accolades.</p>
            <p>Until quite recently I had never discussed these events with anyone from the North Judson area. One
                    day I called an oldster in the town. He is a year older than I, but went through school two years
                    ahead of me. At the time of our conversation he was quite lucid, attributing the bombing either to
                    the Klan or to a dissident parishioner reacting to Reverend <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Rie's refusal to baptize the man's daughter. While the latter is not
                    an unreasonable hypothesis, it in no way lessens the responsibility of the Klan, which staged its
                    incendiary parade just five days before the bombing.</p>
            <p>Neither the fiery cross nor the church vandalism merited mention in the town newspaper. The parade,
                    on the other hand, received a lengthy and laudatory write-up on the front page of the <hi rend="i">North Judson News.</hi> Described as the gala event that it apparently was to the
                    Klan's followers the "spectacular parade" concluded with an open meeting
                    in which Klan members and public "were brushing shoulders." The major speaker of
                    the evening, a Reverend Tilman of Grass Creek, Indiana, addressed the "necessity of
                    restoring the Bible"-meaning the King James version, certainly-"into our public
                    schools." Despite its admiring tone, the account is also vague and distant, noting only
                    that "hundreds" <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-102-4-059"/> of Klansmen were watched by
                    "hundreds" of spectators while the rain kept "hundreds" of
                    others away.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same day's front page also carried news of the bombing, "a most dastardly deed
                    [that] was committed in our little city" The account emphasized that while the
                    "terrific explosion was heard for several miles around and aroused many of our citizens
                    from their slumber," no one had any foreknowledge of the event. The paper noted
                    "several slight clues [that] will be traced in an effort to apprehend those guilty of this
                    and other recent dastardly crimes, which are too low for any self respect-ing citizen to
                    countenance." The <hi rend="i">Starke County Democrat</hi> (published in nearby <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>) also carried a front-page article on the explosion, noting that "[n]o clue
                    whatever was left by the person or persons who threw the bomb, but it is the sincere hope of every
                    good thinking citizen that the perpetrator be speedily brought to justice." Neither paper
                    made any reference to the possible participation of the Klan. The "slight clues"
                    apparently did not prove fruitful either.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The desecration of the church was
                    not covered in the papers, perhaps because vandalism seemed less "newsworthy" than
                    a bombing and the near-death of a housekeeper. After that, the topic disappeared from public
                    discussion.</p>
            <p>I do not recall any incidents between children that had any connection to the Klan. Public and
                    parochial school boys continued to interact with each other on the baseball field and in the scout
                    troop. Such scuffles as there were resulted from the normal childhood differences in sizes and
                    personalities.</p>
            <p>The Catholic and Protestant parts of the community also continued to come together each fall at the
                    annual weeklong Jubilee. The farmers exhibited their produce and entered it for prizes. The
                    merchants and social organizations set up stands that sold food and trinkets. The town <list type="footnotes">

                            there was a real danger such a delivery would have shock-activated the detonator, thus
                            injuring the perpetrator. As the front of the house was completely destroyed by the
                            explosion there would have been no physical evidence of such throwing. I prefer to believe
                            that the bomb was placed on the porch floor, and then the doorbell was rung or, possibly,
                            the glass in the door was smashed to arouse the residents.</item>

                    Street (the Klan's parade route)-on which hired performers entertained several times each
                    day. The town band participated by marching up and down the street and playing a few melodies. The
                    week was an exciting period for all children, certainly. During my last year or so in North Judson I
                    was a member of this band, full uniform and such. As my father had been a trombone player, my older
                    brother had inherited the horn and joined the band. In a few years I, too, became a trombone player

                    training sessions each week after school. In 1930,1 moved away from North Judson, taking my memories
                    with me.</p>
            <p>Historians of the Klan movements distinguish the impulse of the 1920s from both the original movement
                    after the Civil War and the modern version that surfaced in the 1960s.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> While
                    different enough to allow separate descriptions, all three can be encompassed within a tent flying a
                    pennant labeled "KKK." Inside one finds white antis, wearing white sheets and
                    conical hats, imbued with their own sense of righteousness and sharing various forms and levels of
                    bigotry. All operated to some extent outside of the law and used fear and intimidation to further
                    their goals. Secrecy and mumbo-jumbo formed the glue binding the members.</p>
            <p>The Klan of the 1920s recruited the greatest number of supporters from the greatest number of places,
                    making it by far the largest and most widespread of the three movements. Between 1920 and 1926, the
                    Indiana Klan gained control of the state government and of many county governments. This power grab
                    ultimately landed Indiana Grand Wizard D. C. Stephenson and Indiana Governor <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>For all that has been written about this period, historians of Indiana's Klan have gained
                    little access to firsthand knowledge of the inner workings of the organization, either at the state
                    or more local levels. <list type="footnotes">

                    or from written organizational records. In my own purely pragmatic quest to know what happened in
                    North Judson and what caused it to happen, I have reviewed some of the historical literature on the
                    Klan in Indiana. While useful, I find that much of it remains speculative, and that it does not
                    necessarily square with my own experience-however limited that may be.</p>
            <p>The earliest historians and chroniclers of Klan activity generally cited nativism as the controlling
                    force behind the group's actions. In this interpretation, white Anglo-Saxon Protestants
                    united against the Roman Catholics, immigrants, and blacks.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Others added to
                    this picture, to the point that one reviewer of the historical literature in 1977 could cite
                    "four major interpretations about the Klan's prominence in the 1920's,
                    that it was 1) a nativist response, 2) a last stand by rural Americans, 3) an outgrowth of World War
                    I hysteria, and 4) an urban phenomenon brought on by social dislocations."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More modern revisionists have been kinder to the hooded secret society. Leonard Moore, one of the
                    foremost among them, characterizes the group as a "populist organization" and
                    locates the motivation behind Indiana's Klan in "the deterioration of a sense of
                    cohesion, order, and shared power in community life," and "an awakened sense of
                    white Protestant ethnic identity [that] could be used to gain greater popular control over community
                    affairs." Moore concludes that "[s]upport for Prohibition represented the single
                    most important bond between Klansmen throughout the nation." While he has done a great deal
                    of research in the literature and in the Klan records of the 1920s, Moore's work is filled
                    with contradictory statements, and the information in his tables is hidden behind statistical
                    jargon. His sweeping statistical analysis prompts him to conclude that the Klan "went out
                    of its way to avoid confrontations in Catholic, Jewish, or black neighborhoods."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Such a <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Indeed, not all current historians agree with the revisionists. In 2004, Allen Safianow concluded

                    central ingredient of white Anglo-Saxon, Protestant culture." It was a mainstream movement,
                    but it had "a strong base of bigotry to draw on."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Available records certainly attest to the "mainstream" quality of the group in my
                    own part of Indiana. Kluxers organized the Indiana Klan-the Realm-into thirteen provinces. Starke
                    County fell into province number 13, along with <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Fulton</region>
                    </placeName> counties, all located in the north central part of the state. In 1925, two of the
                    principal province officers, the Great Titan and the Great Kligrapp, hailed from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> in Starke County. Each county also possessed its own lower-level organization. One of
                    the top officers was North Judson dentist F. O. Davis who later headed up the Chamber of Commerce.
                    Another was a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> minister. The county officials were evaluated in the Klan's local notes as
                    follows: "Judge not member but O.K.; prosecutor a member and O.K.; sheriff a member but not
                    true to the obligation; all other county officials are O.K." With a population of 9,850 and
                    a Klan membership of 725, Starke County boasted one of the highest percentages (31.8) of native-born
                    white male Kluxers in the state of Indiana-appreciably more than any of the other counties in its
                    province. Members came from a broad cross-section of the white Anglo-Saxon Protestants in the
                        area.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What brought on this relatively sudden enthusiasm for such a social phenomena? Broadly speaking, the
                    onset of Prohibition turned many into lawbreakers by their continued manufacturing, distribution,
                    and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The surge of immigration and the flight of immigrants from
                    the cities to the countryside aroused concerns for the continuity of local life. Someone was at
                    fault! Individuals and communities blamed a variety of culprits: Roman Catholics, immigrants, Jews,
                    blacks, bootleggers, mobsters, gamblers, corrupt politicians, <list type="footnotes">

                    It is unlikely that the bombing and vandalism resulted from direct orders by the Klan leaders.
                    However, an official Klan cross burning and parade clearly established an environment that led

                    be seen as the result of particular changes to that community. Attempts to categorize the

                    these acts were carried out by individuals or small groups. Likewise, attempts to portray the Klan
                    as a civic organization that sought to "avoid confrontation" ignore the reality of
                    the terror that many of us experienced firsthand. In North Judson there was violence, vicious and

            <p>Meredith Nicholson (1866-1947) was an important figure in Indiana's "Golden

                    authored twentyeight books, all but two of which were published between 1903 and 1929, a period in
                    which he wrote full time. Most of these works were best-selling novels, but he also produced a
                    history, a book of short stories, four collections of essays, two books of poetry, and a co-authored
                    play. His third novel, <hi rend="i">The House of a Thousand Candles</hi> (1905), a thrilling
                    adventure/mystery story set in northern Indiana, was by far his most popular and most successful

                    North Meridian Street, Nicholson's prospects at the outset of the Great Depression seemed
                    dim indeed.</p>
            <p>A lifelong Democrat who had been active behind the scenes in the campaigns of others, Nicholson
                    turned for help to his political friends who came into power at that time. Nicholson's
                    longtime friend and personal physician, Dr. Carleton B. McCulloch-who was also a former
                    gubernatorial candidate and current chairman of the Democratic state committee-became his chief
                    promoter. McCulloch enlisted the help of their mutual friend, future governor Paul V. McNutt. In
                    1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who knew Nicholson only by reputation, responded to their
                    entreaties with the offer of a diplomatic appointment to Paraguay.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> As a result,
                    at the age of 66, Nicholson began a new career as a diplomat. Although surprisingly successful, his
                    years abroad would prove star-crossed. After a transfer to a more favorable post in Venezuela in
                    1935, Nicholson found the rising path of his new career suddenly veering downward under mysterious
                    circumstances in 1938 with his demotion to Nicaragua. It was there, in 1941, that he decided to end
                    his service abroad.</p>
            <p>Nicholson's nearly eight years as an American diplomat began in October 1933. No known
                    record explains his selection for the Paraguayan mission: he seemed to be both a deserving and
                    qualified candidate for this remote and low-profile position. A month of
                    "instruction" at the State Department provided the new diplomat with general
                    details of the situation in Paraguay and taught him the basic protocols for a minister of his rank.
                    Then, literally on the eve of his departure, Nicholson married his secretary, Dorothy Wolfe Lannon,

            <p>Nicholson's position grew increasingly more significant as events unfolded around him. No
                    existing records suggest that he received any special instructions about the post, but since 1928

                    </placeName> had battled over the territory known as the Gran Chaco. The area was large-some 150,000
                    square miles, roughly the size of <placeName>

                    economically marginal, "without vegetable or mineral wealth." Unproven rumors
                    persisted, however, that the region contained valuable petroleum deposits. Additionally, the quest
                    for access to the Atlantic via a port on the Paraguay River motivated land-locked <placeName>

                    Welles called the Chaco War the "most bitter inter-American dispute" of the
                    century. Nicholson's diplomatic role was complicated by the popular Paraguayan suspicion
                    that American "dollar diplomacy" or "petroleum
                    imperialism"-specifically the Standard Oil Company-supported the Bolivian effort.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>From his earliest reports, Nicholson displayed a confidence in his information and an understanding
                    of the complexities of the war and of Paraguayan life and society. These messages supplemented his
                    frequent telegraphic dispatches to the State Department, and included pertinent extracts from the
                    Asuncion newspapers, each clearly identified as to its political leanings. Nicholson's
                    characterizations of the people whom he encountered in his work were candid and pointed. He wrote,
                    for example, that he considered Ayala's appointment to the negotiating table of one of his
                    leading critics to be "good politics" but probably not "such good
                    diplomacy." "[He is] notoriously intransigent," wrote Nicholson of Dr.
                    Geronimo Zubizaretta, "a lawyer with a medieval reverence for form and precedent, a
                    forceful advocate but an unpleasant negotiator whom the Commission has not found easy to deal
                    with." In another letter, he described Dr. Justo Pastor Benitez, the principal Paraguayan
                    delegate at the Seventh Pan-American Conference in Montevideo in 1933, as being ineffective because
                    of "his intoxication with his own eloquence."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Nicholson never shied away from making critical remarks about the members of even the highest circles
                    of Paraguayan government. Reviewing the country's succession of officeholders between 1912
                    and 1928, he noted that in a period "which should have covered four administrations of four
                    years, there were 8 Presidents, 4 Vice-Presidents, and 59 Cabinet Ministers. These 71 offices were
                    held by the same 28 men, who shifted about from one post to another. Very probably a few new leaders
                    will emerge as a result of the war, but the tendency in Paraguay is for the Government to have the
                    nature of a monopoly held by a few families." Later, in a "confidential"
                    analysis of President Ayala's administration, he pointed to "some

                    foreign affairs and to the dismissal of "several army officers" for
                    "alleged failures in the Chaco." "It is obvious," Nicholson
                    continued, "that popular unrest is growing" and that "the internal
                    political situation has distinctly disturbing features."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>These letters also regularly featured the ambassador's remarks on various aspects of life
                    and society in the capital city. Although Nicholson praised Asuncion, in a published essay, for its
                    "old world charm" and its "beautiful and picturesque"
                    countryside, his private letters and internal reports reveal another city altogether. He noted the
                    city's "alarming health conditions" exacerbated by the lack of a sewer
                    system and the "flies and skeeters" that gathered everywhere. Most of the homes
                    lacked fireplaces or furnaces, he added, even though temperatures dipped to near-freezing levels at
                    times. The exceptions, according to Nicholson, were a few homes with tiny electric heaters
                    "about the size of a pocket watch."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>In February 1935, once a military decision in Paraguay's favor seemed likely, Roosevelt
                    finally authorized Nicholson's transfer to Caracas, Venezuela. Described by McCulloch as
                    the "<placeName>

                    Asuncion, and its relative nearness to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> kept Nicholson more in touch with domestic affairs and happily allowed for more
                    frequent meetings with travelers from home. Yet Nicholson found Caracas's living
                    expenses-reputedly the highest in the continent-"altitudinous," and he struggled
                    to make ends meet while fulfilling both the social and official duties of his position. The most
                    burdensome requirement involved hosting endless parties-"feedings and
                    cocktailings," as he termed it-usually at the minister's personal expense.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Nicholson represented his country well and befriended Venezuelan leaders, including the aged
                    dictator, General Juan Vicente Gomez, the unmarried but proud father of perhaps one hundred
                    children, most of whom carried the Gomez name and in time held high offices in the government.
                    Gomez's death in December 1935 prevented Nicholson's planned return home for
                    Christmas because the nearly 70-year-old diplomat stayed on and, while dressed in formal evening
                    wear, marched "those three awful miles" in the funeral procession.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>In 1938, Nicholson's diplomatic life underwent an abrupt change. Without warning, President
                    Roosevelt ordered Nicholson's immediate transfer from Venezuela to Nicaragua, in effect
                    demoting him to a much less desirable post. Not only was Nicaragua officially labeled as a
                    "hardship" post-which meant, among other things, that embassy personnel could
                    vacation outside, rather than within, the country-but the accommodations <list type="footnotes">

                    complained about his accommodations, but in his initial report to McCulloch he described the new
                    legation building (which replaced the former house destroyed by an earthquake six years earlier) as
                    "full of leaks, to say nothing of the ceiling in the master's bedroom which may
                    fall according to Newton's law without waiting for an earthquake." He then added
                    that it was "sad that our government hasn't provided a decent house for its
                    representative." Reporter Ernie Pyle, visiting Nicaragua in 1940, echoed the observation,
                    noting that a "strong tropical wind whips through the [ambassador's] house
                    continually. There are no glass windows, and the doors don't fit." Pyle also
                    described the primitive conditions in the capital city of Managua: one
                    "sky-scraper"-a four-story office building-featuring the city's only
                    elevator, public transportation by horse-drawn carriages, an unreliable water supply, and a
                    telephone service that was "100 per cent mystic."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Neither state department files, personal correspondence, nor the press yield any reason for
                    Nicholson's transfer to Nicaragua. Family tradition, apparently based on information
                    personally delivered by a state department official behind closed doors to Nicholson's
                    children, holds that Mrs. Nicholson's "flagrant indiscretions" with some <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> naval officers prompted the change. Nicholson, blithely unaware of these developments,
                    believed simply that "politics" were to blame. In his place, the Venezuelan
                    appointment went to a friend of James A. Farley, Roosevelt's political confidant, campaign
                    manager, and the postmaster general.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Nicholson accepted the change and

            <p>In Nicaragua, Nicholson again made the best of his new situation. He arrived just prior to the
                    official installation of President Anastasio Somoza, a man of ability and courage as well as a
                    ruthless dictator who had seized power the previous year (1937). Nicholson got along well with the
                    likable rogue, who spoke fluent English and shared with Nicholson a deep admiration for Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt. Nicholson worked to further good relations with the Nicaraguan government and people and
                    helped in making Nicaragua a strong ally of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, a basic policy of the U.S. in its dealings with all five Central American nations.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Still the astute commentator, Nicholson made some of his most significant observations in April 1939,
                    when he wrote at length about President Somoza. Although Nicholson had quickly established and
                    maintained good personal relations with the self-installed dictator, his description of Somoza was
                    penetrating and nuanced. Nicholson cautioned <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> not to assume that the recent extension of Somoza's presidency by the
                    constituent assembly represented "public confidence" or a "sincere
                    admiration on the part of the great body of the people." Instead, "the failure of
                    any real opposition" to him was attributable to "suppression" and
                    intimidation "by the Guardia" (national guard). Nicholson called Somoza's
                    strong-arm methods "Hitleresque," compared his greed and cruelty to that of former
                    Venezuelan dictator Gomez, and detailed corruption and dishonesty that extended even to
                    Somoza's dealings with the American legation. Personally, however, Nicholson noted that
                    Somoza was "unfailingly affable, ingratiating, and persuasive." Overall, while
                    Nicholson considered Somoza untrustworthy and insincere, he appreciated the man's
                    consistent pro-American stance; the dictator's personal shortcomings did nothing to derail
                    the administration's policy of friendship with all governments south of the border.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>Ernie Pyle's 1940 visit to Managua marked a second highlight. Pyle, then in his days as a
                    "vagabond reporter," toured Central America shortly after war had broken out in
                    Europe. He devoted five columns to Nicaragua, including one describing his dinner with fellow
                    Hoosier Nicholson and a few others. Pyle greatly admired the famed novelist, and he enjoyed the
                    camaraderie, good humor, and hospitality of the American minister. He also expressed concern about
                    Nicholson's well-being, suggesting that the diplomat owed his country nothing more and
                    could honorably come home and rest on his laurels. Perhaps these comments were a factor in
                    Nicholson's decision to return home the next year.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>In summary, Nicholson's diplomatic career imitated his writing career in its string of
                    unlikely successes. A high school dropout in his freshman year, he had unexpectedly and improbably
                    become a best-selling novelist. Likewise, without any training and without ever holding an elected

                    Indeed, one Nicaraguan journalist suggested that his country should establish and then bestow a
                    special Ruben Dario Medal, named in honor of the country's leading poet and novelist, upon
                    Meredith Nicholson in recognition of his distinguished diplomatic service.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
                    Unexpectedly sent to a remote, uncomfortable legation in Paraguay, Nicholson found himself in a
                    position that had become perhaps the most sensitive on the continent. As Secretary of State Cordell
                    Hull suggests in his memoirs, the Chaco War occupied a primary place of concern in the
                    administration's Latin America policy. This conflict, unusually bitter and bloody, also
                    dominated the proceedings at high-level Pan-American conferences in Montevideo in 1933 and Buenos
                    Aires in 1935, the latter of which both Hull and Roosevelt (briefly) attended.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In broad perspective, Nicholson appeared on the scene precisely at the moment of a "historic
                    shift" in American foreign policy. Although the U.S.'s "Good
                    Neighbor" policy had been anticipated by President Herbert Hoover (who coined the phrase),
                    his was a policy mainly of non-intervention and of American troop withdrawal; Roosevelt offered
                    friendship and trade in addition to pledging not to interfere in the internal affairs of
                    America's sister states.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nicholson's role in implementing the new policy in all three of his postings caught the
                    attention of his superiors. "Secretary Hull has often praised my work," Nicholson
                    told his American confidant in September 1934, but he saw the irony in the situation too. By doing
                    good work in Paraguay, which he later termed "the most undesirable place" in all
                    of South America, he jeopardized his chances for a transfer to a more desirable post.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

                    twenty-eight) younger than her husband, wanted to move on. The former Mrs. Nicholson disappeared
                    from public record and she remains a shadowy figure to this day, for no one has yet been able to

                            years older and also a native Hoosier, was born in 1843, so she could have been widowed and
                            "available" by 1933. Yet, a newspaper photograph of Mr. and Mrs. Nicholson
                            in the latter 1930s suggests that she could be closer to the age of her husband, but perhaps
                            not. Nevertheless, I am grateful to Mary Ann Bradley and Martin Lake, Indiana Historical

                        Centennial History of Gary, Indiana,</hi> 1906-2006 By James B. Lane ([Gary]: Indiana University
                    Northwest, 2006. Pp. 286. Illustrations, index. $20.00.)</head>
            <p>From its origins as the site of U.S. Steel's behemoth manufacturing complex on the shores of
                    Lake <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, Gary, Indiana, has operated largely as a company town where the dictates of steel
                    production have determined the ebb and flow of daily life, the use of natural resources, and local
                    economic fortunes. Yet the story that emerges from James B. Lane's breezy chronicle of the
                    city's first hundred years is one of human resilience and adaptation to often insufferable
                    conditions. Making liberal use of the oral histories that he has compiled over the years, Lane
                    showcases the ordinary and extraordinary men and women who employed varying doses of ingenuity,
                    pluck, and perseverance to make their hometown livable, just, and worthy of pride. The cast of
                    characters takes in a wide cross-section of Gary's social fabric-including entertainers,
                    athletes, political leaders, clerics, immigrants, entrepreneurs, laborers, activists, and
                    eccentricsand their stories propel the narrative.</p>
            <p>The city's centennial anniversary provided the occasion for this expanded volume of the
                    local history journal, Steel Shavings. Much of the material is a rehash of Lane's earlier
                    book, <hi rend="i">City of the Century: A History of Gary, Indiana</hi> (1978), which has come to be
                    considered the standard account of Gary's history. Nearly thirty years have passed since
                    the publication of Lane's earlier work, however, and so, to cover the gap, Lane has
                    included several new chapters that focus on recent political developments. Moreover, some of the
                    earlier material has been revised, reorganized, and embellished with additional photographs. <pb n="371" id="VAA4025-102-4-081"/> A narrated gallery of images on DVD accompanies the volume and
                    is intended as an educational supplement. The photographs of factory interiors are particularly
                    compelling and provide a nice counterpoint to the community orientation of the book.</p>
            <p>Despite the overall upbeat tenor of the book, Lane does not hesitate to take his shots. U. S. Steel
                    frequently draws his ire for its civic negligence. On the other hand, Lane takes a largely
                    sympathetic view of the controversial Richard Hatcher administration. The four-term mayor's
                    difficulties implementing a progressive black power agenda are attributed to national forces beyond
                    his control. The coverage of the Hatcher and post-Hatcher years comprises the strongest as well as
                    the grimmest section of the book. Yet while Lane acknowledges the city's problems with
                    crime, drugs, white flight, and physical dereliction, he ably demonstrates another side to life in
                    Gary, one that has included cultural innovation, athletic accomplishments, some improvement in city
                    services, and even fresh investment.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Gary's First Hundred</hi> Years makes it abundantly clear that during its
                    relatively brief life this mid-sized industrial city experienced firsthand the major developments of

                    ascendance of organized labor, the black power movement, and deindustrialization. By putting a human
                    face on all of these subjects, Lane provides an engaging narrative that will appeal to general
                    readers as well as to undergraduates. Unfortunately, the book lacks citations and a bibliography,
                    thereby limiting its utility for scholars. Nonetheless, researchers who wish to further mine
                    Gary's rich yet understudied history will find this volume to be an excellent point of
                    departure.</p>

            <p>A definitive biography of Peter Cartwright has long been needed. Often used as an example and cited
                    as a source, the man known not only as the most famous frontier circuit rider but also as one of the
                    leading Methodists in early American history clearly deserves more direct scholarly attention. In
                    this volume, literature professor Robert Bray delves deep into Cartwright's place in
                    American religion, politics, and literature.</p>
            <pb n="372" id="VAA4025-102-4-082"/>
            <p>Bray seems most interested in the preacher's long relationship with Abraham Lincoln. Other
                    writers have noted Cartwright's political, theological, and social rivalry with Lincoln,
                    but Bray fully explores these conflicts in a way that makes them more coherent than an occasional
                    reference. The two giants of frontier <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> squared off time and again in public battles over religion and politics, but they
                    agreed on some issues-including slavery-and they shared a similar fame as
                    "self-made" men. Cartwright, like Stephen Douglas, shaped Lincoln's
                    career to the extent that he served as a worthy political and philosophical foe.</p>
            <p>But Cartwright was far more than just a foil for Abraham Lincoln. Following his conversion to
                    Christianity during the Great Revival on the frontier, Cartwright served as a Methodist circuit
                    rider. Known as the "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Boy," his preaching became the stuff of legend and his own <hi rend="i">Autobiography</hi> (1856) helped preserve his almost mythical place in American religious
                    history. Always ready to confront sinners in hopes of converting them, he also quickly took up arms
                    against rival denominations and those whom he considered heretics. On the frontier of
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, Calvinists and Mormons faced Cartwright's wrath just as often as did
                    drunkards and blasphemers.</p>
            <p>One disappointing feature of the book derives from the lack of available sources on
                    Cartwright's frontier preaching. Bray rightly treats the <hi rend="i">Autobiography</hi>
                    with skepticism, since it was written from the perspective of many decades later. But there is
                    little else that details the stories of his adventures as a circuit rider. Bray treats the subject
                    as well as it probably can be, but many readers will wish for more.</p>
            <p>Written records do allow the author to analyze more fully Cartwright's work in church
                    politics. Involved in the government of the Methodist Episcopal Church at the local, regional, and
                    national levels, the famous circuit rider served as a lightning rod on many issues. His brash
                    personality and eccentric behavior sometimes caused him embarrassment and the Methodist conference
                    charged him with improper conduct on several occasions. Cartwright's political ambition
                    also created controversy; his practice of campaigning for office while performing his ecclesiastical
                    duties raised important questions about where the line should be drawn between civic and churchly
                    matters.</p>
            <p>Considered a moderate on the issue of slavery, Cartwright clearly opposed the peculiar institution.
                    He considered owning slaves a sin and hoped to eliminate the immoral practice through conversion and
                    church discipline. But he also believed that abolitionists posed as great a threat to church unity
                    as did the pro-slavery advocates. In the end, his effort to preserve an anti-slavery Methodist union
                    proved impossible and, despite <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-102-4-083"/> his best efforts at saving the
                    national church, the Methodists split in 1844.</p>
            <p>This book is well written and well researched. Bray is generally successful in his attempt to place
                    Cartwright in context, although some historians will be disappointed to find expected titles missing
                    from the endnotes. Still, many of the standard texts are referenced and most readers will appreciate
                    the author's engaging style. While some questions remain, Bray goes behind the legend to
                    show us something of the man who lived the life and helped create the myth.</p>

                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

               </hi> impressively surveys all legal matters affecting African Americans in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> from the territorial stage through the 1880s, although most of the emphasis is on the
                    period before the Civil War. Middleton goes well beyond the title's "Black
                    Laws"-those laws that circumscribed African Americans' legal rights-to place clear
                    focus as well on the issue of slavery in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and most notably the legal process governing fugitive slaves in the state.</p>
            <p>Middleton argues that "race-specific laws could not long endure in a country that made
                    freedom and equality the birthright of its people" (p. 4). In the territorial and early
                    statehood periods, the question of whether slavery would be permitted proved the most pressing legal
                    issue. Although some powerful figures supported opening the territory and new state to slavery, the
                    political mass, including many ordinary folks who had immigrated from the South, opposed slavery.
                    But as Middleton makes clear, opposition to slavery was not the same thing as support for African
                    American civil rights, and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> constitution, while prohibiting slavery, placed several restrictions upon African
                    American residents, including denial of the right to vote. Moreover, by not securing certain rights,
                    the new constitution permitted the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> legislature to pass a number of "Black Laws" over the next few
                    decades-laws that, for example, limited black testimony against whites and attempted to restrict
                    African American immigration to the <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-102-4-084"/> state by forcing such
                    residents to register and post bond.</p>
            <p>However onerous, these laws also led to unintended benefits for African Americans in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Middleton relates how judges' devotion to justice led them to interpret
                    narrowly the black testimony laws. The registration laws served as a basis for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s claim that their courts had a legal say in fugitive slave cases, thus
                    extending some state protection from man-stealing, by far the gravest threat to African Americans.
                    The state's anti-slavery cause increasingly took on an African American civil rights tone
                    as well, and although their numbers were small, Free-Soilers traded their support of Democratic
                    control of the legislature in exchange for the repeal of a number of the black laws, including those
                    involving immigration, testimony, and education. The restriction on suffrage would be lifted by the
                    fifteenth amendment, and the remaining black laws by an 1887 repeal effort led by African American
                    legislators.</p>
            <p>While Middleton's book seems a solid recounting of the legal process in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, this reader's confidence was disturbed by a number of anachronisms in the
                    text: among them, referring to National Road communities as a political base for the black laws of
                    1807, when the National Road was not built until the mid-1820s; noting the influence of Charles G.
                    Finney on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> abolitionism, without noting his presence at Oberlin subsequent to 1837; labeling David
                    Walker's <hi rend="i">Appeal</hi> a newspaper and not a pamphlet; and using W. E. B.
                    DuBois's 1903 phrase "talented tenth" to characterize <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> African American leaders' hopes for public education.</p>
            <p>For Hoosier readers looking for hints about race relations in Indiana, the volume may be of limited
                    use. Indiana may well have seen a hardening of racial restrictions on African Americans over the
                    course of the antebellum period, culminating in the exclusion clause of the 1851 Constitution.
                    Indiana's experience, therefore, calls into question Middleton's larger thesis
                    that race-specific laws could not stand in a land of liberty and equality. Middleton's work
                    invites scholars of Indiana to replicate his indepth research into the enforcement of the
                    increasingly stricter formal laws in the state.</p>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and, therefore, provides an especially powerful lens through which to view the growing
                    division between North and South that ultimately produced an emancipatory civil war.
                    Bordewich's sprawling narrative seeks not so much to prove this argument as to embody it.
                    The author densely packs <hi rend="i">Bound for Canaan</hi> with vivid stories and biographical
                    vignettes illustrating how a series of improvised escape routes across the Mason-Dixon line and the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> developed into a dependable yet secretive transportation
                    network. An increasing level of organization and militancy characterized the funneling of southern
                    fugitives northward between 1800 and 1860. But certain constants render problematic the term
                    "Underground Railroad," with its implications of corporate hierarchy and
                    capital-intensive investment. Transporting fugitives depended on flexibility, opacity, and the
                    individual initiative of slaves seeking to permanently cast off their bondage and to rescue family
                    members. The movement relied on free blacks-including former slaves-to guide, conceal, and provide
                    information to fugitives seeking to elude recapture by masters, slave-catchers, and law enforcement
                    officials often in hot pursuit. The initial core of white participants in the underground was drawn
                    from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> community, but gradually expanded to include evangelically-minded abolitionists,
                    especially after 1830. For the thousands of blacks and whites who risked their personal safety to
                    violate the law of the land, often on behalf of complete strangers, participation in the underground
                    put revulsion toward slavery into action.</p>
            <p>The geography of the Underground Railroad indicates some of its other salient features. With dramatic
                    exceptions, only slaves from the Upper South had access to the network of safe-houses, guides, and
                    pathways that channeled them to freedom. <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> was the "Canaan" for a significant proportion of fugitives. There,
                    people such as Marylander Josiah Henson, Kentuckian Henry Bibb, and Pennsylvanian Mary Ann Shadd
                    attempted to build communities to deliver on the promise of American life beyond the reach of laws
                    that made freedom in the northern U.S. a tenuous prospect. Whatever their ultimate destination, many
                    fugitives relied on the assistance of Hoosiers in order to ensure the success of their freedom
                    journeys. Bordewich prominently features the impressive underground activities of Levi Coffin, the

                    River</geogName>.</p>
            <p>The covert exodus of thousands of slaves possesses inherent drama, and the book provides numerous
                    compelling examples of their successful escapes as well as episodes of physical confrontation and
                    personal tragedy. Painting details of sectional crises and antislavery politics on a broad canvas
                    means that context sometimes threatens to overwhelm the core subject of the study.
                    Bordewich's effort to describe the underground's resistance as the fulcrum of a
                    victorious antislavery movement leads at times to rhetorical over-reach. Readers seeking a more
                    focused, intensive appraisal of the underground movement's myriad participants and the
                    relative prevalence of particular methods and routes of escape may not be entirely satisfied.
                    Nonetheless, Bordewich's ambitious narration vividly presents the combination of moral
                    fervor, opportunity, and audacious bravery that offered individuals and the nation alternatives to
                    slavery and racism. While the Underground Railroad could hardly redeem "the soul of

                    century. In this heavily footnoted volume, Bigham brings together an impressive array of secondary
                    sources and supplements these with original research into census materials, tax records, and other
                    primary documents. The work makes a valuable contribution to the scholarly record and represents a

            <p>The broad story of race relations in America following emancipation and Reconstruction is well known.
                    Still, the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> valley provides a convenient region in which to view the
                    small variations in race relations between the once slaveholding South-represented here by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, on the river's south bank-and the strongly racist free states on the north
                    bank. For the most part, as Bigham shows, blacks in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> valley lived separate from whites, whether by law, by custom, by power, or by fear.
                    With this separateness-on both sides of the river-came inequality of resources and opportunity.
                    Black men and women in the valley responded as they did elsewhere-by protesting on occasion, by
                    accommodating as a rule, and by forming separate institutions to undergird their pursuit of human
                    survival and advancement as a free people.</p>
            <p>Following emancipation and the end of the Civil War, former slaves moved closer to the river,
                    sometimes stopping in the larger cities and towns of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and more frequently seeking the northbank urban centers of <placeName>

                    first in order to provide a means of supporting themselves, but also chasing the less tangible
                    benefits of freedom. Whether in a small <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> with a past seasoned by support for the Underground Railroad, blacks quickly discovered
                    the insecurity of their "freedom": housing in short supply, jobs limited by racial
                    restriction, violence both random and with purpose, voting and civil rights more a dream than a
                    reality. While the story is not new, Bigham supports it with extensive documentation, often going
                    county-by-county up one side of the river and then down the other.</p>
            <p>Not simply the objects of historical forces and white decision makers, African Americans created
                    separate settlements when faced with hostility in urban centers, established some remarkably
                    sophisticated social and educational institutions, and sometimes even made the difference in
                    political decisions when whites were divided. Bigham fills his pages with tidbits of information and
                    with the names of otherwise anonymous people, but the individuals in this volume never really come
                    alive as real people-they are buried in the details.</p>
            <p>Unless truly interested in all of the historical examples, the reader might profitably review the
                    summaries that begin and end each chapter, or even skip to the epilogue, which gives a strong
                    analytical summary of the larger picture of black experience in the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>
                    valley and projects the impact of this experience well into the twentieth century.</p>

            <p>To open the wide pages of John W. Reps's <hi rend="i">John Caspar Wild: Painter and
                        Printmaker of Nineteenth-Century Urban America</hi> is to become immersed in the trials and
                    tribulations of an artist's survival in the earlynineteenth century. Swiss-born John Caspar
                    Wild (1804-1846), who arrived in America in 1832 to seek his fortune using his considerable talents
                    as painter, lithographer, and print colorist, spent fourteen years moving from one emerging frontier
                    metropolis to another.</p>
            <p>The chronological narrative, complete with meticulously researched documentation and flawless color
                    and monochromatic reproductions, follows Wild's industrious output from his various
                    residencies in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
               </placeName>, and
                    the Davenport, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, region. A pragmatist, Wild favored the massproducible medium of lithographic prints
                    for the images of recognizable buildings and panoramic scenes that he marketed to residents of the
                    cities of the expanding West.</p>
            <p>Wild's skillfully created lithographic stones, used to publish serial subscriptions and
                    prints, were occasionally acquired by others and thereafter easily used with no credit given to the
                    original artist. Plagiarism haunted Wild during and after his life, most brazenly in the case of a
                    painting donated in 1901 to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society, in which a large copy in oils of Wild's 1840 lithograph
                    showing a lake area in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was claimed to have been painted by donor Henry Lewis.</p>
            <p>The perils of derivative prints only add to the baffling reasons for Wild's historical
                    obscurity. That Reps found any information at all is due to Wild's most important
                    chronicler in the early 1950s, John E McDermott, a professor of English at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> University and tireless historian of the city's early years. McDermott
                    "recognized the need to study the artistic culture of the region as a means of both
                    regional preservation and national promotion" (p. xvii), according to Andrew J. Walker,
                    author of the book's perceptive introduction. Indeed, Wild's re-exposure after
                    World War II resulted from the use of his images by historic preservationists fighting urban
                    renewal.</p>
            <p>Walker, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Art Museum's Curator of American Art, evaluates Wild's place in the
                    larger art world by comparing his work to that of Fitz Hugh Lane, a painter of preCivil War New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> harbor views. The age-old predicament of minimal patronage and limited exhibition
                    opportunities away from the East Coast exacerbated Wild's continual struggle for sustenance
                    and acclaim. <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-102-4-089"/> Indiana's better known frontier artists,
                    George Winter (1809-1876) and Wild's fellow countryman Karl Bodmer (1809-1893), may have
                    been more popular for their documentations of disappearing Indian tribes.</p>
            <p>Wild, like many serious artists, actually wanted to become known for his easel paintings, which are
                    compelling, if a bit stiff, with fine color sense and faultless perspective. In order to make ends
                    meet, the artist accepted work coloring others' engravings and lithographs. He also
                    ‘demonstrated significant talent in his few efforts at portrait painting, but did not
                    pursue this more lucrative career. His moves from city to city appear to have been prompted by his
                    quest for new locations with no competing images of local buildings and panoramas.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">John Caspar Wild: Painter and Printmaker of Nineteenth Century Urban America</hi> is an
                    appealing read for historians and art enthusiasts alike. The oversized book, conducive to the
                    display of rarely seen lithographs and paintings, is visually scrumptious. Ornate period script
                    announces each chapter, further introduced in bold captions to draw the reader into the text.
                    High-grade pages of interspersed grays, creme, and white enhance the images and offer subtle
                    variety.</p>

            <p>Stephanie A. Carpenter succeeds admirably in her stated purpose with <hi rend="i">On the Farm
                    Front.</hi> She rightly perceives an oversight in writing of previous agricultural historians who
                    organized their examinations of farm work according to separate spheres, confining women to
                    "the house, garden, and chicken coop" (p. 3). Historians who discuss working women
                    during World War II have focused on industry rather than agriculture. <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-102-4-090"/> Women working in agriculture during the war, at least those working
                    under the auspices of the federal Women's Land Army now have a historian who fills the gap
                    and makes the WLA salient. Carpenter interprets their experience "in the context of
                    regional differences and with regard to class, gender, and race" (p. 5). She concludes by
                    arguing that "World War II increased the number of women in farming, as in the national
                    workforce as a whole" (p. 156).</p>
            <p>The WLA organized in the spring of 1943 under the leadership of extension career woman Florence L.
                    Hall. Its workers, recruited through state extension organizations, were supposed to wear blue
                    uniforms-overalls, shirt, jacket, and cap. Most, however, disdained the denim and dressed as they
                    pleased.</p>
            <p>Although Carpenter's attention to a neglected, vital movement is laudable, there are some
                    problems with her interpretations of the biases against the women working in the fields. She argues
                    that "farmers were prejudiced against bringing nonfarm women on farms" (p. 73);
                    she summarizes the literature against the WLA to the effect that it "pitted the morality
                    and innocence of farm families against the perceived immorality and worldliness of WLA
                    participants" (p. 63). Midwestern farmers in particular, although Indiana is not
                    specifically examined, "demonstrated a bias toward the WLA" (p. 120). Worse,
                    Southern farmers refused the help of middle-class white women because they thought only black women
                    and poor white women should work in the fields.</p>
            <p>However, it appears that Carpenter has been subtly captured by her sources-mainly publications and
                    papers of extension workers. By the 1940s, extension workers had developed a tradition of denouncing
                    backwardness among farmers and attributing it to prejudice. Judging by the extension literature
                    produced after the war, all of the WLA workers were delighted with their farming experiences and the
                    backward farmers in the Midwest and South had become a little more enlightened.</p>
            <p>A more critical reading of sources would go deeper than this; closer consideration of local
                    circumstances would provide alternate explanations. If the farmers of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, as Carpenter says, preferred their Mexican workers, was this because they were biased
                    against the WLA women or because they were really pleased with the work ethic, family values, and
                    ready availability of the workers they had? As for the idea that farmers were especially suspicious
                    of the morality of young city women, what about farmers’ opinions of the morals of their
                    male help? Did farm folk <hi rend="i">ever</hi> argue that hired hands were a morally uplifting
                    influence in their households?</p>
            <p>Oral interviewing of WLA veterans and the farmers who employed them might have redressed the bias of
                    the sources. Though oral history sources must also be ready critically, <pb n="381" id="VAA4025-102-4-091"/> here is a case where they could only have enriched the story.</p>

            <p>Writing that it is "time to reexamine Pontiac's Uprising," David Dixon has
                    penned what amounts to one book and one suggestive essay (p. xi). He offers a vivid narrative of the
                    battles and maneuvers of Indian and British forces in the conflict known popularly as
                    Pontiac's War, but then argues, unconvincingly that the impact of the war on western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> contributed in a substantial way to the coming of the American Revolution a decade
                    later.</p>
            <p>This book joins Gregory Evans Dowd's <hi rend="i">War Under Heaven</hi> (2002) and William
                    R. Nester's <hi rend="i">Haughty Conquerors</hi> (2000) in a new wave of scholarly
                    attention to Pontiac's War. Where Dowd placed primary cause for the war on the preachings
                    of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> prophet Neolin and on the pan-Indian spiritual revitalization movement that erupted
                    throughout the Great Lakes and <geogName>Ohio valley</geogName> at the end of the Seven
                    Years' War, and where Nester assigned principal blame to the miserly and arrogant actions
                    and attitude of British commander Sir Jeffrey Amherst, Dixon combines these causes with colonial
                    demand for Indian land to explain the "savage war to expel the whites from their
                    land" (p. 183). Whether the author means that the war was fought in a savage manner or that
                    "savages" started the war is not always clear. Though Dixon depicts the incredibly
                    brutal actions committed by all sides in the war, he spills more ink on Indian depredations than on
                    European atrocities; further, he does so without placing such actions in cultural context. The book
                    lacks an ethnohistorical focus that could better explain Indian motivations and the author
                    deliberately eschews "masterful analysis" for "chronology and
                    narrative" (p. 283).</p>
            <p>The main strength of Dixon's book lies in its dramatic and thorough narrative of events and
                    personalities involved in the war. Dixon is a good storyteller and his depictions of the sieges at
                    Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Fort Pitt, the Battle at Bushy Run, and of persons such as Henry Bouquet make for
                    compelling reading. Dixon immersed himself in the British primary literature and reproduces in an
                    appendix two letters from Bouquet to Amherst <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-102-4-092"/> written during the
                    midst of the Battle at Bushy Run. Bouquet's forces, on their way to relieve Fort Pitt in
                    August 1763, were ambushed by Indians in overwhelming numbers yet managed to outmaneuver them and
                    get most of the military unit to Fort Pitt. The Swiss officer Bouquet and the Scottish Highland
                    troops under his command became folk heroes to settlers in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> for their daring and fierce counterattack. The military history focus of most of
                    Dixon's book is its strong point, yet this approach begs for a more nuanced discussion of
                    causes and impacts.</p>
            <p>Though Dixon promises "to offer readers new insight into the causes and important
                    consequences" of Pontiac's War, seven of the eight chapters cover the military
                    actions of the 1758-1765 period, with only the remaining eighth chapter cursorily devoted to the
                    impact of the war on later times and peoples (p. xi). That last chapter is interpretatively the
                    weakest, as Dixon cherry-picks events from 1765 to 1776 that involved persons from western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> in an attempt to demonstrate a direct connection between the Paxton Boys and other
                    Indian-hating terrorist groups and the call for independence from Britain. The supposed connection
                    between the Paxton Boys and calls for independence requires more analysis than is offered here; the
                    author has not proven precisely what role they and other backcountry settlers played in toppling
                    British imperial power. The fact that those settlers remained just as disillusioned with the new
                    government of the <placeName>

                    foresee the impact of their actions.</p>

            <p>Andrew Denson's contribution to the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>'s series on Indians of the Southeast joins a growing and timely debate about
                    Indian sovereignty. Focusing on the Cherokees, one of the most acculturated of the Five Tribes in
                    the nineteenth century, Denson's text richly explores resources only marginally used by
                    previous historians. Rather than depending upon Bureau of Indian Affairs materials, the book
                    considers <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-102-4-093"/>
                    <placeName>

                    </placeName> House and Senate memorials, documents, and speeches prepared by the Cherokee leadership
                    as examples of both meaningful resistance to American Indian policy and engagement of broader
                    conceptions of Indian nationhood. Denson, whose approach to the sources draws on the literary
                    criticism of Arnold Krupat and Homi K. Bhabha's theories of "cultural
                    ambivalence," maintains that the Cherokees responded to changes in American life by arguing
                    that the preservation of Indian nations, rather than their dissolution, would be the most effective
                    means to progress.</p>
            <p>The removal of the Cherokees from their homelands to Indian Territory provided them with an education
                    in negotiating the political terrain of American politics, and established the outline for
                    nineteenth-century arguments over the "Indian Question." At every major turning
                    point in the dialogue, from removal to Civil War to the allotment process, the Cherokees built upon
                    a platform of ideas that offered an alternative to consistent either/or demands from the U. S.
                    government. Their arguments included: the existence of a distinct community pre-dating European
                    intrusion, the success of an early treaty partnership with the government, the failure of the
                    government to fulfill its obligations, the suffering attendant to Cherokee loyalty and failed
                    government protection, the successful example of Cherokee assimilation, Cherokee leadership in
                    Indian Territory over Plains Indian cultures, and the virtue of Indian nations free of white
                    interference as a safeguard against corruption.</p>
            <p>One of the book's most fascinating aspects is its account of the many uses made by Cherokee
                    leadership of reform sentiment within Gilded Age culture. Grant's paternalistic
                    "Peace Policy" became a promotion of Indian autonomy, corruption in reservation
                    administration was united to corporate scandals, and guarantees of Cherokee separateness became a
                    model of successful reform worthy of the continuation of Indian Territory status. The Cherokee
                    leaders went so far as to equate their nationhood with the distinct status of corporations, arguing
                    in favor of legal rights and communal land ownership. The Okmulgee Council provided a sixyear-long
                    arena for the refinement of much of this rhetoric. In addition, the multinational Indian fairs held
                    at Muskogee bolstered their positions by supplying evidence of Indian order, education,
                    Christianity, industry, and agricultural advancement-the hallmarks of American progress.</p>
            <p>Denson concedes that his work reveals very little about Cherokee culture and society. An educated
                    Cherokee mixed-blood elite composed of representatives chosen by the Cherokee National Council
                    constructed the responses to federal demands. Their arguments do not reflect the understandings or
                    the attitudes of all Cherokees. Denson's work reveals, however, an inspired and dynamic <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-102-4-094"/> interaction of ideas among competing interests with enormous
                    stakes at risk. This well-researched and beautifully written book will be a welcome addition for
                    university courses in Indian history and law and U.S. history as well as offering an intelligent
                    discussion of Indian issues in nineteenth-century America for a general audience.</p>

            <p>"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable," declared Senator Daniel
                    Webster in 1830, in a speech memorized by generations of schoolchildren well into the next century.
                    This sentiment, largely uncontested since the Civil War, could not be taken for granted by Webster
                    or his contemporaries. In fact, many people of his time viewed union and liberty as entirely
                    different-even mutually exclusive-considerations. It was Abraham Lincoln who achieved the
                    intellectual and political formulation that allowed the durable marriage of the two ideas in the
                    body politic, an achievement brought into focus by this valuable little book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Lincoln's Defense of Politics</hi> presents a series of intellectual portraits
                    limning the thought of the major political figures of the antebellum era-including the usual
                    suspects (John Calhoun and William Lloyd Garrison) as well as some who are relatively overlooked as
                    political philosophers (Frederick Douglass and Henry David Thoreau). As Thomas E. Schneider shows,
                    abolitionists and pro-slavery theorists, for all their obvious differences, often shared
                    surprisingly similar assumptions about the relationship between legal and moral law and about the
                    possibilities and limits of the U.S. Constitution. In particular, many of these people bore deeply
                    suspicions of politics-here understood as the necessity to resolve, pragmatically if not necessarily
                    logically, the divergences of interest, ideology, and morality that are inevitably part of any
                    social compact.</p>
            <p>As Schneider shows, Lincoln proved unusual in his insistence on both the necessity for a highly
                    imperfect Union and the ultimate-not immediate or even foreseeable, but eventual-end of slavery. Yet
                    Lincoln <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-102-4-095"/> was not the only thinker trying to square an apparent
                    circle by securing both union and liberty. (Indeed, this was ultimately the basis of a successful
                    electoral coalition.) Like Lincoln, Stephen Douglas sought to occupy the crucial middle ground
                    between fiery abolitionists and fire-eating secessionists. But while Douglas believed that
                    slavery's fate in the Union could be resolved without recourse to moral considerations,
                    Lincoln considered morality essential to the resolution-an assertion that he shared, perhaps
                    ironically, with some pro-slavery theorists. Lincoln also possessed an exceptionally supple ability
                    to reason his way into right making might, all the while realizing the necessity to persuade even
                    bitter opponents of the efficacy of his view-and actually doing so, something that began to happen
                    even before his death.</p>
            <p>While not technically a work of history, this book nevertheless affords a notably succinct and
                    intellectually nuanced survey of the intellectual landscape of the quarter-century before 1865. Part
                    of the University of <placeName>

                    its mission to address scholar and buff alike, even if it could not easily be described as light
                    reading. One finishes the book amazed, yet again, by the clarity and compassion of
                    Lincoln's vision, and it is Schneider's accomplishment that he brings this truism
                    to life anew.</p>

            <p>One of the first things I learned in graduate school was the difference between works of history and
                    antiquarian studies. The former asked larger, interpretive questions of the material, while the
                    later studied a single narrow topic for its own sake. This exceptionally modest monograph is most
                    definitely a piece of antiquarianism.</p>
            <p>Stock yards, though no longer a part of the American landscape, once played a vital role in providing
                    the nation's foodstuffs. The facilities operated next to, yet separate from, the great
                    packing houses, and provided <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-102-4-096"/> acres of pens to hold the animals
                    that arrived by rail, there to be brokered, traded, and slaughtered.</p>
            <p>The author provides a brief overview of the industry, chronicling the rise and fall of this business
                    method for handling meat. She then devotes most of the work to a survey of the nation's
                    stockyards, providing brief descriptions of all the major facilities. Each of these 3-6-page case
                    studies follows the same format, describing the founding of the yard and the choice of its location,
                    presenting statistics on output at its height, and then detailing reasons for and the timing of its
                    demise. Two dozen yards are so chronicled, including the one in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which receives the standard treatment.</p>
            <p>This book suffers from a number of shortcomings, not the least of which is its modest vision. The
                    discussion of the fundamental period of stockyard creation and dominance takes only seven pages and
                    provides little sense of the changes-especially the revolution in work process-that created this
                    industry. Only seven pages treat <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Union Stock-Yards, and while the author mentions the businessmen who created
                    and ran these operations, she mentions nothing of the Prince family, the key figures behind the
                    development of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> pens and their operation until their finale in the late twentieth century.</p>
            <p>While the author draws on a few worthwhile interviews, she makes little use of primary sources, and
                    demonstrates at times only a cursory reading of the secondary literature. Her discussion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example, depends entirely on older sources; she wisely discusses the 1919 strike,
                    but makes no reference to the critical article on this subject by Dominic Pacyga.</p>
            <p>Other omissions mark the text, most notably the lives of the workers. A few personal stories enliven
                    the manuscript, but the human beings that appear are usually (although not always) the entrepreneurs
                    who built the yards, rather than the men who worked in them.</p>
            <p>The author also neglects to discuss the reuse of these massive facilities, many of which have been
                    turned into industrial parks. Her discussion of the Ft. Worth operation reveals that it has been
                    turned into a western theme park for tourists, a tantalizing notion and symbolic of why the broader
                    notion of redevelopment is worth further study.</p>
            <p>Finally, the work occasionally lapses into old-fashioned language that is questionable in a scholarly
                    work. At various times we read about "Anglo-Saxon ideas of free enterprise" (p.

               <hi rend="i">"The Train is Coming,"</hi> a stylish fashion plate in <hi rend="i">Godey's Lady'</hi>s Book of May 1850, depicted two women in crinoline skirts
                    admiring a train on a far-off viaduct safe from the belching beast's soot and cinders. Two
                    decades later Godey's celebrated the completion of the transcontinental
                    railroad-"a great work begun, carried on and completed by men only." In a bow to
                    its feminine readership, the journal lauded the "humane and peaceful employment"
                    of womankind in the trade and friendly intercourse of nation building (p. 2).</p>
            <p>In this engaging study, Amy G. Richter rides the rails with the women of Victorian America, exploring
                    a rich and shifting complex of private values and public culture. Richter's exhaustive
                    readings of female travelers' diaries and letters provide lively anecdotes and narrative
                    for an incisive account of how the new woman traveler molded an "at home" ideal on
                    the railroads, taking the parlor from the front room to the dusty coach and transforming it. The
                    engineer still kept his hand on the throttle but behind him he hauled "An Adamless Eden on
                    Wheels," a palatial railcar fitted out for ladies and the bane of male riders forbidden to
                    enter this rolling paradise (p. 110).</p>
            <p>The image of the vulnerable, fragile white Victorian woman radically changed when she stepped aboard,
                    venturing from a sheltered life into the public sphere. Beyond their carping, male passengers and
                    the railroad employees who served her adapted with chivalry and civility. For the African American
                    woman traveler racism compounded the challenges of gender and class. "These same
                    ‘gentlemanly and efficient’ conductors ...deliberately fold their arms and
                    turn round when the Black Woman's turn came to alight," Southern traveler Anna
                    Julia Cooper wrote in 1892 (p. 47). Documented cases of African American female passengers who went
                    to the courts for redress foreshadow the landmark decisions of the next century.</p>
            <p>The railroads had always been and to a large degree would remain the domain of men with
                    "Nerves of Steel." A chapter with this title explores fictional works with
                    railroad heroines and accounts of real-life adventurers like globe-girdling Nellie Bly all of them
                    filled with images of romantic, daring young women. Such images depicted a vision of strong and
                    capable womanhood, "a New Woman, one fit for life on the rails, that emerged alongside and
                    in conversation with popular notions of strong manliness" (p. 139).</p>
            <p>The roles of railroad bosses, "gentlemen" conductors, and the legendary <pb n="388" id="VAA4025-102-4-098"/> Pullman porters are examined as they welcome women travelers aboard,
                    initially sensing a strain on those nerves of steel but eventually coming to accept the
                    domestication of their often rude preserve. As instruments of change, their lady passengers exert a
                    cultural influence that extends far beyond the rail lines and whistle stops to the frontiers of
                    public life.</p>
            <p>A groundbreaking contribution to the history of women and the railroad, Richter's meticulous
                    research and lucid prose illuminate the passage from Victorian America to modern times, the nuanced
                    layers of private lives and separate spheres, and the public culture and corporate strategy that
                    show the remaking of the life and landscape of nineteenth-century America-a terrain where the New
                    Woman took her seat on the Twentieth Century Limited and began the journey anew.</p>

            <p>The publication of <hi rend="i">Global America</hi> brings to completion D. W. Meinig's
                    four-volume, twenty-year writing project, "The Shaping of America." The series
                    commenced with <hi rend="i">Atlantic America</hi> 1492-1800 (1986), which described the colonial and
                    earlynational era as part of a broader Atlantic history. Meinig's second volume, <hi rend="i">Continental America,</hi> 1800-1867 (1993), described the expansion of the nation
                    westward to the <geogName>Pacific Ocean</geogName>, but with the greater West still detached from
                    the eastern domain. That national domain was split over the slavery controversy, a tale that Meinig
                    vividly portrayed in cultural geographic terms. Volume Three, <hi rend="i">Transcontinental
                    America,</hi> 1850-1915 (1999) traced the creation of western culture regions and their binding to
                    the national domain in the railroad era; the book covered, as well, the geography of immigration and
                    manufacturing during what Lewis Mumford once dubbed the Paleotechnic era: the nation's
                    first industrial age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Global America</hi> completes the task of telling our national history by describing the
                    geography of mobilization in the automobile, electrical, and air age-the Neotechnic era, in
                    Mumford's terms. The geography of a national system of federal highways, <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-102-4-099"/> enhanced with the introduction of the interstate system in the 1950s
                    and 1960s, and the consequent migration of Americans to create new regions or improve older ones
                    form major topics of discussion. Meinig considers the geography of airways to illustrate further the
                    dynamism of twentiethcentury America.</p>
            <p>The concept of regionalism forms an important theme in this book. For Meinig, regionalism can be
                    based upon any of a number of criteria: resentment (the South), rational management (the
                        <geogName>Tennessee Valley</geogName> Authority), or simply sectionalism, a term Meinig employs
                    to refer to the everyday fact of cultural differences based upon religion, language, and ethnicity.
                    Of the author's various latetwentieth-century American regions, the most interesting is
                    Megalopolis, the urban and suburban corridor stretching from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> south to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C. Megalopolis, a concept taken from the French geographer Jean Gottmann, forms the
                    heart of the nation ("twenty percent of the population residing on only two percent of the
                    national land" [p. 149]). This vital region itself lies within a larger Manufacturing Belt,
                    which stretches westward to the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. The Midwest, for Meinig,
                    extends from western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> all the way to the northern Great Plains, including the Corn and Wheat Belts that cross
                    Indiana. The greater South is presented as a region still apart from the North, a place with its own
                    subregions and subcultural peculiarities. Finally, Meinig defines the regions of the greater West
                    and of isolated areas including Alaska, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>,
                            <country reg="pr">Puerto Rico</country>
               </placeName>, and the "internal
                    empire" of Indian reservations.</p>
            <p>The book's final hundred pages define the geography of the American empire abroad, paying
                    particular attention to our Pacific reach to East and Southeast Asia, the Atlantic bridge to the
                    European Union, and our involvement in the Islamic Heartland of the Middle East. This section ends
                    emphatically with three photographs of critical institutions and symbols of our imperial ambitions:
                    the United Nations building ("Paradox of Power"), the U.S.'s bid to end
                    its historical isolationism; a panorama of lower Manhattan bookended by the World Trade Center and
                    the Statue of Liberty ("Capital of Capitalism"); and the Pentagon
                    ("Massive Seat of Militarism"). His discussion of the U.S.'s sense of
                    betrayal by the U.N.-even as our power to control the global economy and to manipulate military
                    information for political purposes raises anti-American resentment elsewhere-seems particularly apt
                    during these troubling times.</p>
            <p>Meinig presents American history in a fresh way by emphasizing cultural geography as a complement to,
                    not a substitute for, traditional historical narratives. He stresses changing human geographies over
                    any sort of determinism based upon physical geography. Another welcome feature of Meinig's
                    work is his consideration of America's borderlands; <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-102-4-100"/> Mexico, and the Caribbean are presented
                    throughout the series as organically involved with American national space.</p>
            <p>Overall, the author has again succeeded brilliantly in writing a lively narrative interspersed with
                    innovative maps (a great atlas could be created by collating the maps from the four volumes) and
                    historical and contemporary photographs of cultural landscapes and symbolic sights. One can quibble
                    with his regionalization: I was disappointed to see the Northeast coast presented simply as
                    Megalopolis (see Wilbur Zelinsky's <hi rend="i">The Cultural Geography of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> [1992] for an alternative regionalization), but I must admit that
                    Gottman's concept fits perfectly the final volume's overall theme of mobility. The
                    author rightfully claims that his is the first attempt by a historical geographer to capture the
                    500-year history of Europeanized North America in complex detail. I hope that historians and general
                    readers of American history will read these wonderful books.</p>

            <p>As one of the few monographs to examine critically the institutional changes taking place in a major
                    museum, Catherine Lewis's history of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Historical Society (CHS) represents a major contribution to the museum field. In
                    contrast to most celebratory volumes commissioned for significant anniversaries, Lewis, associate
                    professor of history and women's studies at Kennesaw State University and also special
                    projects coordinator at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> History Center, presents a dispassionate but critical analysis of an organization in
                    transition.</p>
            <p>Through deep mining of the archives, and with extensive interviews of former and present CHS staff as
                    well as other museum professionals, Lewis has assembled an intimate and eminently readable portrait
                    of change in one of the country's most prominent urban historical institutions. She
                    explores in depth the factors behind the CHS's transformation from an elitist institution
                    celebrating the refinement of the city to a dynamic public forum welcoming diverse voices and
                    engaging the community in meaningful dialogues. As CHS <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-102-4-101"/> Board
                    Chairman Richard Needham noted in the 1992 annual report, "We had evolved from simply being
                    a collector of history or ‘<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s attic,’ to an institution on a journey to reach out to the
                    city's diverse groups" (p. 80). Lewis connects that journey to broader currents of
                    professional and social change.</p>
            <p>The book's enduring contribution, however, lies in Lewis's ability to go beyond the
                    simplistic dualities that sometimes characterize the "reinvented museum" and to
                    probe the subtle and complex nature of institutional change over time, particularly in the last half
                    of the twentieth century. Rather than focus on the ephemeral impact of innovative exhibits or
                    programs, Lewis looks at the sustained efforts of a series of museum leaders to effect
                    transformative, long-term change-as defined by institution-wide impact, sustained financial and
                    intellectual support, and challenge to the museum's interpretive authority. This final
                    condition forms the core theme of the book as Lewis explores the tensions between the
                    museum's traditional role as commemorative site and purveyor of civic pride on the one
                    hand, and its new commitment, on the other, to tackle deep-seated issues of identity and social
                    inequity in partnership with the community. The impact of such changes on the staff in particular
                    makes the book compelling reading for museum leaders seeking to instill similar institutional change
                    in their own institutions. While few individuals other than the CHS presidents and curators are
                    named, the challenges for staff trying to effect the transformation of the society's
                    mission are apparent. In particular, the shift from a tradition of curators as sole custodians of
                    collections and primary authors of the exhibitions to a newer model of collaborative, teambased
                    projects emerges as a signal change in the fundamental relationships between museums and their
                    audiences. As Lewis notes, "Once passive recipients of expert knowledge, contemporary
                    museum constituencies are now more likely to challenge interpretations with which they
                    disagree" (p. 34). Other broader museum and social trends are woven into the institutional
                    history-the rise of multiculturalism, the erosion of expert authority, culture wars, and the
                    tensions of balancing academic representation of the past with popular and entertaining visitor
                    experiences.</p>
            <p>If there is a weaknesses in the book, it may be the inverse of its strength. Lewis crafts a tightly
                    scripted narrative (only 137 pages of text) that clearly follows the core themes of transformation
                    and interpretive authority, but the human stories within the institution are muted. Perhaps the
                    interviewees were only as forthcoming as they appear to have been on condition of anonymity, but the
                    author's insight into staff perspectives would have been made more compelling with more
                    quotes and first person accounts. Instead, CHS's presidents and its principal exhibitions
                        <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-102-4-102"/> (including "We the People", the
                    "Neighborhoods" project, and "A House Divided") become
                    Lewis's main characters. The "real-life" constraints of institutional
                    change are homogenized and generalized. Greater attention to personal accounts would have revealed
                    more of the contests and conflicts typical of any institution in transition and likely would have
                    been more instructive for those who want to learn from the CHS's example.</p>

            <p>More than a quarter century after its tragic demise in the jungles of British <placeName>
                        <country reg="gy">Guyana</country>
                    </placeName>, the Peoples Temple and its charismatic leader, the Reverend Jim Jones, continue to
                    fascinate scholars. This collection of essays attempts to understand Jones's messianic
                    movement and its implications for the sociology, politics, and history of African American religion.</p>
            <p>According to the editors, while previous scholarship about the Peoples Temple and Jonestown
                    acknowledges the heavy participation of African Americans, it fails "to explore in a
                    substantive way the implications of these demographics," especially the numerous ways that
                    the predominantly white leadership of the Peoples Temple "emulated Black Church culture in
                    style and form, and to some extent, in substance" (p. xiii).</p>
            <p>The book comprises ten chapters, each of which can be read as a stand alone article, though they vary
                    in purpose as well as quality. Some of the most insightful and provocative among them, such as those
                    authored by Anthony B. Pinn, Mary R. Sawyer, and Milmon Harrison, appear to have been written
                    specifically for this volume. Others chapters, written by J. Alfred Smith and Muhammed Kenyatta,
                    were written shortly after the Jonestown tragedy. Additional contributions, one by the late C. Eric
                    Lincoln and Lawrence Mamiya, another by Archie Smith, Jr., represent two early examples of
                    scholars' attempts to understand the implications of the Peoples Temple for the study of
                    the black American religious experience. Tanya Hollis and co-authors Duchess Harris and Adam
                    Waterman examine the political and social activism that characterized the Temple during its halcyon
                    days in the Mendocino Valley and <placeName>

                    </placeName> Bay area.</p>
            <p>Of particular note is Rebecca Moore's attempt to create a collective biography of the
                    movement's membership. Her demographic evidence <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-102-4-103"/>
                    strongly suggests that Jonestown "was a racially black community in a number of key
                    respects" (p. 57). Not only did African Americans make up a majority of the Jonestown
                    enclave, but black senior citizens' social security checks also comprised a major source of
                    income for Jonestown for nearly a year. Finally, Moore argues-on the basis of rather slim
                    organizational chart evidence-that African Americans held key leadership positions in the jungle
                    outpost. Even less convincing is her claim that, culturally speaking, the Peoples Temple was a black
                    religious group.</p>
            <p>This is the crux of the book's main argument: That the Peoples Temple represented one of
                    several modalities of the black American religious tradition. Ultimately, this claim requires
                    careful analysis of racial and institutional identity, and in this respect the book falls sadly
                    short of its intended purpose. The fact that Jones borrowed liberally from Father Divine's
                    Peace Mission, that he employed elements of traditional black American religious culture in his
                    services, or that the majority of his followers were African American no more imparts a black
                    religious identity to the Peoples Temple than the appropriation of African American youth culture by
                    Coca-Cola or Nike makes these corporate entities authentically black. This methodological
                    flaw-viewing black religious style as synonymous with black religious substance-is evident
                    throughout most of the book (except for Smith's chapter, which casts serious doubt not only
                    on the characterization of Peoples Temple as a representation of the black religious tradition, but
                    also on whether it was a church at all).</p>
            <p>Not much in <hi rend="i">Peoples Temple and Black Religion in America</hi> can be identified as truly
                    new scholarship. Nearly half of the ten chapters have been previously published. Devotees of Indiana
                    history will note the absence of any in-depth analysis of the movement's beginnings in <placeName>

                    self-appointed leader. Unfortunately, this book remains eerily silent on these questions.</p>
            <p>Moore, Pinn, and Sawyer admit that their book "is not intended as a definitive treatment of
                    Peoples Temple." They "hope other scholars will respond to the challenge to
                    enlarge our understanding of this multifaceted movement and the people who found meaning in
                    it" (p. xvii). This reviewer hopes so, too.</p>

                    scientific names for more plants than any other naturalist. But nomenclature was only one of his
                    many scientific passions, which ranged from archaeology to zoology. This volume, arranged in nine

                    published writings in those other areas of inquiry. All of these pieces are rare-several discovered
                    only within the last few years-and their recovery and reissue will help broaden understanding of

            <p>The tradition of writing historical biography for young readers seems to have fallen out of favor
                    with many authors and presses, leaving student and general reader alike to fall back on
                    Internet-published biographies of inadequate length and often dubious attribution. Enter the IHS
                    Press with this well-produced biography of Hoosier soldier and author Lew Wallace. The volume nicely
                    balances text and illustrations and also recommends further reading and historic sites associated
                    with Wallace. Librarians at every school and public library in Indiana should acquire this book for

            <p>Theodor Brandes emigrated from Prussia to Oldenburg, Indiana, in 1853. In October 1862, Brandes
                    earned $800 as a paid substitute enlisting in the 83rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry
                    Regiment. His subsequent letters, transcribed from the original German, detail the 83rd's
                    actions during Grant's approach to Vicksburg but stop before the surrender of the city, due
                    to Brandes's death from sickness. The letters also provide a window into the thoughts of a
                    soldier who was fighting not for abolition or for the Union, but for the monetary gain that his

                    biography of Lincoln ever published. This critical edition brings together all of Herndon's
                    strengths in an accessible and documented format. The full text of the original 1889 edition
                    appears, followed by an appendix identifying material added to a revised 1892 edition. Endnotes to

                    in authoring the text, and summarizes scholarly debates about Herndon and his research methods,

            <p>Using church records and local history sources, Carol Parks Morrison has written an extensive history
                    of two Presbyterian congregations that, during the course of their long history, became one.
                    Although most of Morrison's chapters are organized by successive pastorates, the
                    author's eye for detail yields a story that brings out the important role played by lay
                    members of the two churches-in particular, the women. Beyond the obvious appeal to members of the

                        <p>Your review of <hi rend="i">Dark Union</hi> in the September 2006 <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> (pages 283 to 285) was cogent and well-balanced. As your reviewer, Michael
                                    W. Pfau, mentions, the citations provided by that book's authors Leonard E
                                    Guttridge and Ray A. Neff tend to be woefully vague. However, your reviewer
                                    completely omits one of the book's major contentions-namely, that John
                                    Wilkes Booth survived for many years after 1865. And on <hi rend="i">that</hi>
                                    theme, the book's citations are <hi rend="i">not</hi> vague. After reading
                                    the book, I went to Special Collections at Indiana State University Library and was
                                    favorably impressed by the documentation that is now held there related to John
                                    Wilkes Booth's post-1865 survival. Some of that documentation is now posted
                                    on the internet and can be viewed by going to: http://library. indstate. edu/
                                    about/units/rbsc/neff/neff-idx. html It is clearly time to test a DNA sample from
                                    the alleged vertebra bone of John Wilkes Booth that is held at the Navy Medical
                                    Museum in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, D. C. But unless influential U.S. Civil War historians issue a public
                                    call for such a DNA test, it evidently will not occur. And the government has
                                    recently made such a test more difficult by encasing the vertebra bone in plastic.</p>
