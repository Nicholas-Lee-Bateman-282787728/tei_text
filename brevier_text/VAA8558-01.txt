                                            ready to proceed to Legislative business.
                                        The resolution was adopted.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            RULES.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON offered the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the rules for the
                                            government of the Senate of 1855, be adopted as the
                                            rules for the government of the present session of the
                                            Senate.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GOODING. Before the vote is taken, I would desire to suggest that
                                I shall propose an amendment of the rules, so as to make it a
                                contempt of the Senate for any Senator to bolt, and that he shall be
                                dealt with accordingly.
                            The PRESIDENT. The question is upon the adoption of the
                                resolution.
                            Mr. GOODING. I move that this matter be postponed until Monday next
                                at two o'clock.
                             Mr. TARKINGTON. I would like to know if it is going to take him that
                                long to get his amendment ready? It must be a grave and weighty
                                amendment.
                            Mr. GOODING. It is, sir. I understand from the chair, that he is very
                                much indisposed and is very anxious to get through his business. I
                                supposed there would be nothing more tnan a simple organization.
                                Several Senators do not know what these rules are. A number of
                                Senators have never been in this body before, and when they come to
                                a vote upon rules for the government of the Senate it is not right
                                they should go it blind. I hope, therefore, that the resolution may
                                be postponed.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I presume it is important to have rules and
                                regulations for the government of the Senate. I propose the rules of
                                1855, and move to lay the gentleman's motion upon the table.
                            The PRESIDENT. The question is upon the motion to lay upon the
                                table.
                            The yeas and nays were demanded.
                            The PRESIDENT. I would suggest to the Senate that we have not been
                                furnished with lists from which to call the yeas and nays, and
                                therefore it would be impossible to take any question in that
                                manner.
                            A VOICE. We shall insist on the yeas and nays.
                            A SENATOR. For the purpose of settling this matter, I move that the
                                Senate do now adjourn.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            The PRESIDENT. The Senate stands adjourned till nine o'clock Monday
                                morning.

                            Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I thank you for this
                                preferment, honorable indeed, if the obligations which attend it
                                shall be discharged with fidelity; and your generous confidence
                                whose voice I obey in assuming them, shall be remembered with
                                gratitude. Allow me to assure you of the gratitude of an overflowing
                                heart, as the best pledge in my power for that fidelity; and to say,
                                if this alone were sufficient to secure success in this to me
                                untried position, I should not hesitate at the threshhold, nor
                                distrust, as I now most unfeignedly do, my abilities and preparation
                                for its duties.
                            The people of Indiana look to the present General Assembly with
                                unusual interest - an interest 
                                approaching anxiety. They expect much at our hands. This House, as
                                an integral branch thereof, is to them no less an object "of
                                interest and hope; for they know that upon it depends the successful
                                action of the whole A common constituency desire that we shall act
                                as becomes the representatives of a common people, suffering under
                                the pressure of the times, and the evils incident to improper and
                                inefficient legislation upon very many of the most important
                                interests of society. They ask that we shall unite, and, as one man,
                                labor for the correction of old abuses and the prevention of new;
                                that their finances be placed upon an equitable and firm basis, and
                                their Treasury protected from invasion from whatever-quarter; that
                                all unnecessary expenditures shall be cutoff; that their servants
                                shall be justly paid for their services, and all nameless and
                                ruinous perquisites withheld; that the common school system shall be
                                re-constructed and rendered harmonious with the Constitution and
                                conducive to ihe thorough education and development of the rising
                                generation, into whose hands the State with all her interests arid
                                institutions must soon pass. Nor are our public charities regarded
                                by the peo pie with less solicitude. They must be secured against
                                all abuses and enabled to give expression to that highest phaze of
                                associaied benevolence of which they are the appropriate
                                representatives. In a word, Indiana, in the language of Nelson,
                                expects every man to do his duty.
                            Called upon to act as your organ in responding to these just
                                expectations and hopes of the State, I need not say to those who
                                know me, and whose kindness has placed me here, that whatever I can
                                do to facilitate the accomplishment ofour common purpose shall be
                                done. I know however that I shall often fall short of your just
                                expectations, and be under the necessity of relying upon your
                                wisdom, sympathy and the charitable forbearance of the House by
                                whose" kindness I have been called to these responsibilities, One
                                thing only I promise - my errors shall be errors of the head - not
                                of the heart.
                            Relying upon your charitable support, I again thank you from the very
                                bottom of my heart.

                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper
                                                furnish the members, at their desks, each, with a

                                                the House and Senate, as soon as practicable.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                COMMITTEE TO WAIT ON THE GOVERNOR.

                                            Resolved, That a committee of two
                                                be appointed by the Speaker, on the part of the
                                                House of Representatives, to act with a similar
                                                committee on the part of the Senate, to wait on His
                                                Excellency the Governor, to learn from him what time
                                                he will deliver his message, and that the Senate be
                                                informed of the adoption of this resolution.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                 DOOR-KEEPER'S SERVICE.
                                Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren, submitted the following, which was
                                    adopted:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the duties usually
                                                imposed upon and performed by a Sergeant-at-arms, be
                                                performed by the Doorkeeper of this House, without
                                                additional pay.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. JEFFRIES submitted the following, which was a opted:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                                instructed to procure and cause to be placed upon
                                                the desk of each member of this House, a copy of the
                                                Revised Statutes of the State of Indiana, and a copy
                                                of the Journals and Acts of the Session of 1857.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                ASSISTANT DOOR-KEEPERS.
                                Mr. MURRAY, of Elkhart, submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                                allowed to appoint such assistants as he needs, not
                                                exceeding six in number,
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. HUNTER proposed to amend,by striking out "six," and inserting
                                    "four."
                                Mr. MURRAY, of Elkhart. Mr, Speaker, I thought my proposition a
                                    considerable retrenchment; and I think if the gentleman will
                                    reflect on the duties the Door-keepers have to perform, he will
                                    find that four will not be sufficient. Looking over the number
                                    of Door-keepers required by the last Legislature, I find they
                                    had ten or eleven in each House - twenty-four in both Houses.
                                    This service requires two Doorkeepers here in this Hall, two in
                                    the stationery-room, and two for the fires. I think six
                                    absolutely necessary for the business of the House.
                                The amendment was adopted; and the resolution as amended was also
                                    adopted.
                                Mr. KEEFER submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved That the Assistant Clerk
                                                have leave to appoint two assistants.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. JONES What amount of force would that give to the desk?
                                The SPEAKER. Three Clerks besides the Principal Clerk.
                                Mr. TEBBS. Does that permit the Principal Clerk to appoint two
                                    also?
                                The SPEAKER. It does not.
                                Mr. TEBBS. I would suggest an amendment, then, that we have four
                                    Clerks appointed.
                                Mr. KEEFER. I am willing to that - let each clerk appoint
                                    two.
                                Mr. COLGROVE. I apprehend that this resolution is a little
                                    premature. I suppose it is intended that the House shall take
                                    under its control the fixing of the number of Clerks, and I hope
                                    to be able to satisfy the country that I am in favor of economy.
                                    I know we must have necessary clerical help in order to dispose
                                    of business. Our Principal Clerk is a new man in his position
                                    without official experienceand I supoose a day or two will give
                                    him a little experience, sufficient for him to determine what
                                    number of Clerks are necessary. Until we learn what we need in
                                    this service we ought to dispense with any resolution of this
                                    kind. I therefore move to lay the resolution and pending
                                    amendment on the table.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                            
                            
                                NEWSPAPERS FOR MEMBERS.
                                Mr. DOBBINS submitted a resolution instructing the Door-keeper to
                                    subscribe for and procure, to be laid upon the desk of each
                                    member of this House, during the present session, three copies
                                    of the following newspapers: The Daily State
                                        Journal, the Daily State Sentinel,
                                    and the Weekly Locomotive.
                                Mr. RITTER moved to lay the resolution on the table; but withdrew
                                    the motion for - 
                                Mr. MURRAY, of Elkhart. Mr. Speaker, I think we should subscribe
                                    only for such newspapers as have Reporters on this floor. It has
                                    been usual in both branches of the Legislature to subscribe for
                                    about three copies of all the newspapers published in the city
                                    of Indianapolis. But I think we ought to confine our
                                    subscriptions to those supporting Reporters here; and I think
                                    that will meet the approbation of our constituents. They want to
                                    know what is going on here, and I have yet to find out a single
                                    man that has ever grumbled at receiving this kind of information
                                    from his Representative. For this simple reason, I am opposed to
                                    subscribing for all the papers of the city. We might as well go
                                    out and subscribe for papers all over the State. I move to amend
                                    the resolution by saying three copies of such newspapers as
                                    support Reporters of the proceedings of the General
                                    Assembly.
                                Mr. DOBBINS. A resolution was adopted this morning allowing all
                                    Reporters of the various city newspapers the privilege of seats
                                    within this bar; and upon that rule we should subscribe for them
                                    all. My object in subscribing for newspapers in this way, is to
                                    send out information of the proceedings of the Legislature. I
                                    simply require three copies of the Journal,
                                        Sentinel and Locomotive.
                                    I think these will be sufficient, and little enough. This is a
                                    resolution that has been adopted by every Legislature for
                                    several years past, and it is certainly one of the best means of
                                    conveying to the country information of the action of the
                                    Legislature. I am willing to go for every city paper having
                                    Reporters on this floor.
                                Mr. MURRAY, of Elkhart. Mr Speaker, I have a little experience in
                                    this business - an experience of seven years as a Reporter in the other end of the Capitol.
                                    I have seen discussions of this kind, and they generally end in
                                    subscribing for the papers. I can not be in favor of embracing
                                    in the resolution too many papers, but I would be willing to
                                    subscribe for every paper in the State that is represented here
                                    by a Reporter. There are but two papers in this city that have
                                    furnished permanent Reporters for the Legislature, and it has
                                    been the uniform custom - a very absurd custom, I think - to
                                    subscribe for all the papers in the city. I wish to restrict the
                                    resolution to those papers that furnish regular Reporters on
                                    this floor. If they are able to support Reporters on this floor,
                                    I think we ought to take their papers. They pay some $15 or $20
                                    per week for Reporters here, for the information of our
                                    constituents as to the proceedings of this body, and this is the
                                    only means we have of giving our proceedings to the people of
                                    the State. Therefore, I think it is our duty to patronize those
                                    papers which furnish these reports; and as I said before, I have
                                    never yet heard a complaint on account of such an expenditure of
                                    the public money. I submit the following amendment:
                                Strike out all after "Resolved," and insert, "That the
                                    Door-keeper be empowered to procure three copies for each member
                                    of such of the papers of this city as shall maintain Reporters
                                    on this floor for the purpose of reporting the proceedings of
                                    this House in full."
                                Mr. BOYD. I move to strike out "three" and insert "two."
                                Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren. By the terms of the amendment of the
                                    gentleman from Elkhart, all the city papers may set Reporters on
                                    this floor for the sake of getting patronage. It has been
                                    customary, I believe, to appoint a committee in this matter, to
                                    wait on the publishers and ascertain their terms for furnishing
                                    a certain number of papers, stamped and ready for distribution.
                                    To give time to think about this matter, I move to lay the
                                    resolution and amendment on the table.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                            
                            
                                PROSCRIPTION OF TOBACCO.
                                Mr. AUSTIN submitted a resolution to the effect, that the
                                    Door-keeper be instructed to post up in conspicuous places in
                                    this House, copies of the 27th of the rules adopted for the
                                    government of this House - [the rule against smoking in the
                                    Hall] - and see that it be enforced.
                                Mr. DAVIS. I am requested by the Door keeper to state, that the
                                    rale will be enforced without the adoption of any
                                    resolution.
                                Mr. AUSTIN. Still it will stand for information of the rule, if
                                    the resolution be passed. I have myself already felt the
                                    deleterious effects of smoking here, and I want our visiting
                                    friends posted up in the matter.
                                The resolution was adopted.
                            
                            
                                HATS OFF IN THE LOBBY.
                                The SPEAKER. There is another rule that should be also specially
                                    enforced, and that is that gentlemen shall not wear their hats
                                    in the lobby.
                                Mr. DOBBINS. What is the number of the rule to which the Chair
                                    refers?
                                The SPEAKER. I do not know. It is a good rule, and we shall try
                                    to have it enforced, whether it has been adopted amongst the
                                    members here or not. This is a court and we shall endeavor to
                                    enforce all rules for good order.[Laughter.]
                            
                            
                                 MR. TEBBS.
                                On the motion of Mr. DURHAM, his colleague from the county of
                                    Dearborn, [Mr. Tebbs,] came foward to the forum, delivered his
                                    credentials, received the oath of a member of the House of
                                    Representatives at the hands of the Speaker, and took his
                                    seat.
                                The House then adjourned till Monday morning at nine o'clock.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            MONDAY, November 22, 1858.
                        
                        The PRESIDENT. I am requested by the Secretary to ask Senators to pay
                            particular attention to the reading of the Journal this morning,
                            especially in the reading of the votes, as he, desires that the Senators
                            may know they are recorded as voting right for officers of the
                            Senate.
                        The Journal of Saturday was then read.
                        
                            RULES.
                            The PRESIDENT announced the consideration of this subject - the
                                question being the laying upon the table the motion of the Senator
                                from Hancock to postpone the resolution of the Senator from Brown
                                till two o'clock.
                            The motion to lay upon the table was rejected.
                            Mr. GOODING. I will either withdraw my motion or amend it so as to
                                extend the postponement until to-morrow morning at ten o'clock.
                            The question was submitted, but the Chair being unable to decide on
                                the vote, a division of the Senate was called for, and 26 Senators
                                voting aye,-
                            The resolution was postponed until tomorrow morning, ten o'clock.
                        
                        
                            ASSISTANT SECRETARIES.
                            Mr. CRAVENS offered the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Secretary and
                                            Assistant Secretary of the Senate be authorized to
                                            appoint a necessary number of Clerks to transact the
                                            business, and that they report the names, in accordance
                                            herewith, at two o'clock P. M.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GOODING. I have only one objection to the resolution, and that is
                                the requiring of a report by two o'clock. I am willing to vote for
                                it, if the Senator will consent to the postponement of the report
                                until to morrow at two o'clock.
                            Mr. CRAVENS. I will consent to the postponement of the report until
                                to-morrow at ten o'clock.
                            The PRESIDENT. Will the Senate consent to the adoption of the
                                resolution as amended?
                            Mr. WEIR. I offer the following as an amendment:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper of the
                                            Senate be authorized to employ a number of assistants,
                                            not exceeding six, in addition to his assistant; and
                                            that the Principal and Assistant Secretary be also
                                            authorized to appoint six assistants, and that they
                                            report the names of such assistants as soon as they may
                                            be selected.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GOODING. I move to lay the amendment upon the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            The PRESIDENT. The question is now upon the adoption of the
                                resolution.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I have one thing to say. It seems to be determined to force the
                                appointment Of men upon the Secretaries before they need them. I
                                presume that when they desire help, they will inform the Senate of
                                the fact. I do notknow that they desire any help at present.
                                Whenever they will inform the Senate what help they need, I will
                                vote for tne increase; until they do, I will vote against it.
                            The resolution was again read.
                            Mr. CRAVENS. If there is anything compulsory about that, I do not
                                understand the English language. I wish simply to give them nower,
                                if they choose to exercise it, to appoint assistants. I presume the
                                Secretaries would not appoint more than were necessary.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I move to strike out all that part of the resolution
                                which requires them to report at two o'clock.
                            The motion was agreed to by unanimous consent.
                            The PRESIDENT. The question is now upon the adoption of the
                                resolution as amended.
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                            Mr. BENNETT Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Doorkeeper procure
                                            and lay upon the table of Senators a copy of the Revised
                                            Statutes of Indiana and of the Senate Journal and Acts
                                            of the Legislature of 1857.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The PRESIDENT. Will the Senate consent to the adoption of the
                                resolution.
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                             NEWSPAPERS.
                            Mr. McLEAN. Mr. President: I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of three be
                                            appointed by the chair to wait upon the respective
                                            publishers of the Daily Sentinel,
                                            Daily Journal, the Daily Citizen, and the Locomotive,
                                            to ascertain the lowest terms upon which they will
                                            furnish three copies of each of said papers to each
                                            member of the Senate, and report to-morrow if
                                            practicable.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GOODING. I offer as an amendment that the Democrat and Volksblatt, weekly issues,
                                be included.
                            The PRESIDENT. The question is upon the adoption of the
                                amendment.
                            Mr. WEIR. I move to lay the amendment upon the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I move to strike out all except the daily papers.
                            The PRESIDENT. The question is upon the motion to amend by striking
                                out all except the daily Journal and Sentinel.
                            Mr. McLEAN. The Citizen will be distributed about
                                three o'clock every afternoon, when we will have an opportunity of
                                reading our morning's proceedings. I think there is a propriety in
                                taking it as it is an evening paper, and the Sentinel and Journal are morning papers.
                                In addition, the Citizen will have a Reporter upon
                                this floor.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I offer tbe following as an amendment to the
                                amendment:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        "Resolved, That the door-keeper be
                                            authorized to contract with the publishers of the Daily
                                                Citizen, Daily Sentinel, Daily Journal, the
                                            Weekly Volksblatt, Weekly Free Press, and the National
                                                Democrat, for three copies of their papers, two
                                            to be enveloped and laid upon the tables of members and
                                            officers."
                                    
                                
                            
                            I thought if we got the Journal Republican Senators
                                would be pleased, the Sentinel would please the
                                Democrats, the Citizen is neutral or a little
                                inclined to be American, the Volksblatt is the
                                Democratic German paper, the Free Press is the
                                Republican German paper, and the Democrat, I
                                believe, is according to the Senator from Hancock.
                            Mr. GOODING. Pretty generally. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. MURRAY. I did not think of the Indiana
                                    American, I will consent to insert it.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I move to amend by inserting the Indiana
                                    Farmer..
                            Mr. MARCH. I am opposed to taking any newspaper except one copy of a
                                daily paper that reports the proceedings of this body. By
                                subscribing to the balance, we would accomplish no good except to
                                benefit the printers. They are very worthy men; but every newspaper
                                in the State has the same right to this patronage. [That's so.] We
                                have a right to take these papers as information to aid us in
                                legislation. A daily report is necessary with a good, comprehensive
                                and generally correct view of what is done. The subscribing for so
                                many papers opens the door for taking from ten to fifteen dollars
                                worth of postage stamps apiece, and it is said that instead of
                                disseminating information, they are sometimes used for the purchase
                                of overcoats. [Laughter.]
                        
                        
                            MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE.
                            A Clerk of the House appeared and said that he was directed to inform
                                the Senate that the House of Representatives have organized by the
                                election of Jonathan W. Gordon, of Marion, for Speaker; Richard J.
                                Ryan, of Marion, for Clerk; George H. Chapman, of Marion, for
                                Assistant Clerk, and Robert O. Jennings, of Floyd, for Door-keeper,
                                and that they are now ready to proceed to business, and that the
                                House had adopted the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of two be
                                            appointed by the Speaker, on the part of the House of
                                            Representatives, to act with a similar committee on the
                                            part of the Senate, to wait on His Excellency, the
                                            Governor, to learn from him at what time he will deliver
                                            his message, and that the Senate be informed of the
                                            adoption of this resolution.
                                    
                                
                            
                            And asked the Senate's concurrence therein.
                        
                        
                            COMMITTEE TO WAIT ON THE GOVERNOR.
                            Mr. MURRAY. The committee of the House are waiting for the
                                appointment of the committee on the part of the Senate. I hope that
                                the Senate will take up the message of the House.
                            The Senate consented, and the resolution from the House was read by
                                the Secretary.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I move that the Senate agree to the appointment of a
                                committee on the part of the Senate, and that the Chair appoint.
                            The Senate agreed, and the Chair appointed Messrs. Wallace and Murray
                                said committee.
                            Mr. MARCH. We have been called together for the purpose of devising
                                some ways and means for the replenishing of an exhausted Treasury. I
                                know of no better way than that which a prudent, honest citizen
                                takes in private life. I am in favor of lessening extravagance and
                                reducing high salaries. It may seem a small matter, but we must lay
                                down principles. I have no doubt but that every citizen looks upon
                                the taking of these newspapers as
                                a useless expenditure of money. One-half of them are lost in this
                                Hall and never sent from the postoffice, and the constituent in
                                hardly any case gets them in consecutive numbers. I hope the Senate
                                will be as prudent as the House in this matter.
                            Mr. WEIR. I move that the resolution, as amended, be laid on the
                                table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            NEWSPAPERS.
                            Mr. WEIR. I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of two be
                                            appointed by the Chair to procure one copy of the daily
                                            papers published in this city, and that the Reporters of
                                            these papers be provided with seats within the bar.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I rise to state a matter of fact told me by a member
                                of the House. He said that the Editors could not publish the
                                proceedings and furnish Reporters upon this floor short of two
                                copies being subscribed for by each member. I make this statement
                                because he went to the offices for the purpose of making the
                                inquiry.
                            Mr. WEIR. The original resolution was for three, but as some Senators
                                seem disposed to cut down, I am agreed. I don't see any use in
                                taking the weeklies. We are just as much bound to take all the
                                papers in the State. I will accept of an amendment of two or three,
                                just as the gentleman wishes. I should like for the resolution to
                                read two copies, instead of one.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I move to refer the resolution and amendmendment to a
                                committee of five.
                            Mr. CONNER. I desire to make a single observation before the vote is
                                taken. I propose to reverse the order here. We came here as the
                                servants of the people - at least I speak for myself - and I think
                                we should derive much more information by receiving copies from the
                                country press, thus enabling us to have direct communication with
                                those from whom we receive our trust. This matter of taking daily
                                papers from the city, as far as extending information to the country
                                goes, amounts to nothing. It amounts to a monopoly by the city to
                                the exclusion of the countrv press. I hope that if this subject is
                                referred to a committee, that that committee will take the whole
                                matter under their careful consideration.
                            The motion prevailed, and the Chair appointed Messrs. Tarkington,
                                March, Slack, Cravens and Line.
                        
                        
                            GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
                            Mr. WALLACE, from the committee appointed to wait upon the Governor
                                and inform him that the Senate was ready to hear his message,
                                reported, that the Governor designated half-past two o'clock P. M.
                                to day, as the time for the reading of his message.
                        
                        
                            DESKS FOR REPORTERS.
                            Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                            directed to furnish seats for the Reporters of the Sentinel and Journal, and such others as may desire such.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GOODING. I wish to name the Citizen in the
                                resolution - it ignores all other papers but the Sentinel and Journal.
                            Mr. WEIR. I understand that matter has been referred to the committe
                                of five.
                            Mr. BOBBS. I would name the publishers of the Free
                                    Press and Volksblatt.
                            The amendment was agreed to.
                            Mr. BENNETT. I move that this matter be referred to a committee of
                                five.
                            The resolution was referred to the committee by consent.
                        
                        
                            HAIR PINS AND GOLD-HEADED CANES.
                            Mr. WALLACE offered a resolution prohibiting all officers of the
                                Senate and their assistants, unless otherwise authorized, from
                                contracting for the purchase of any articles for the use of the
                                Senate, but that they shall apply to Librarian, who shall purchase
                                only when he cannot obtain them from the Secretary of State.
                            The resolution being read by the Secretary - 
                            Mr WALLACE said: Mr. President, I understand quite a number of new
                                Senators, who electioneered upon the stump, brought in a charge upon
                                the last Legislature of excessive extravagance in the purchase of
                                just such articles, and it is for the purpose of vindicating
                                ourselves, irrespective of party, that I introduce this resolution.
                                While in the Library, yesterday, I examined the amounts paid, and
                                found some extraordinary items. I will give a specimen. I found an
                                item for hair puff pins, and what any Senator on this floor wants
                                with such a thing, I don't know. [Laughter.] I found an item for
                                tooth brushes, and I found several items for looking-glasses. Now, I
                                never looked into a looking-glass inside of this Hall, and I don't
                                know that I caught, any other Senator at it. I found boot-blacking
                                and blacking-brushes, and gold-headed canes, that I know no member
                                of this Senate, and I am sure no member of the House ever got, and
                                the question arises, who did get these articles? and why should the
                                State be called upon to pay for them? This resolution is for the
                                purpose of closing down upon such operations. There is a kind of
                                black mail which should be stopped, as against the State. I do not
                                offer this resolution as against any officer of the Senate, and I
                                presume that they will make no engagement with any one, or employ
                                any person who will make such purchases as these. I simply wish to
                                close the door against such things as I refer to in the
                                resolution.
                            Mr. MARCH. I am in favor of the proposition substantially. Every
                                gentleman knows that when we come to the close of the session
                                business is done in a hurry. These accounts are presented here
                                without number and there is no explanation given to them. There can
                                be no way to stop this evil except by the adoption of some such
                                system. This resolution does not impeach any body's integrity, but
                                it prevents business being done at loose ends. The probability is
                                that this Legislature will continue either in actual or nominal
                                session one hundred days; and I hope Senators will put down the bar
                                noweither adopt this resolution or refer it to a committee. Let us
                                lay down an example on the second day of our session.
                            Mr. GREEN. I move to refer the resolution to a committee of five
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I see by that resolution; that the Librarian has to get
                                from the Secretary of State's office; now the Secretary of State
                                will 
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    THE LEGISLATIVE SENTINEL
                    BINGHAM & DOUGHTY, PUBLISHERS. ARIEL & WM. H. DRAPIER,
                        REPORTERS.
                    
                        Vol. I.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, NOV. 27, 1858.
                        No. 2.
                    
                    
                        
                            not let anything go without a written receipt. Our Door keeper might
                                give him a receipt and let him require a receipt in turn from
                                members. I am ready to vote for any resolution that will stop this
                                kind of extravagance.
                            Mr. MURRAY. As far as general economy is concerned I suppose we all
                                agree. That there was and has been rascality in every session of the
                                Legislature we will not take the responsibil ity of denying. Now we
                                have a Door-keeper, let him report under o.tth, and let no account
                                be allowed unless under oath. I don't see any necessity for making
                                the Librarian the financial officer of the Senate in making these
                                purchases. The Librarian is not our officer, and the Door keeper is;
                                we have control over him, and can put the strings down upon him. I
                                hope that the resolution of the Senator from Montgomery will be so
                                amended as to strike out "Librarian" and insert "Door keeper"

                            Mr. BOBBS. I concur with the Senator from Howard that the Librarian
                                is not the proper officer. I think that a committee can report some
                                system upon which we can agree. We all agree that something must be
                                done.
                            Mr. Green's motion was agreed to, and the President appointed Messrs.
                                Green, Wallace, March, Conner and Weir, said committee.
                        
                        
                            SMOKING.
                            Mr. HILL. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                            directed to prohibit smoking in the Senate Chamber
                                            during session hours.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. WALLACE. It you will make it apply to the smoking of stoves, I am
                                content. The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            BANK FRAUDS.
                            Mr. WEIR offered a resolution calling upon the chairman of the felect
                                committee of last session of the Senate on Bank Frauds to make out
                                the names of witnesses summoned before it. The distance traveled by
                                those witnesses; and to make out the sum the Sergeant at-arms is
                                entitled to; that the same be certified to for payment; and that the
                                chairman certify to the whole, for the use of the Finance
                                    Committee of the Senate.
                            Mr. MURRAY. That is an entering wedge to a little expense. This
                                committee have given the names of witnesses, and the time and
                                mileage they are entitled to. If the Senator will state any
                                specified object he has in view, I may have no objection to his
                                resolution.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I wish to state a few things in connection with this
                                subject. It is time the committee did certify to the distance each
                                witness traveled, but there is nothing there to show what the
                                Sergeant-at arms done. As Chairman of the committee the subpoenas
                                were all signed by me. The Sergeant-at arms received only a small
                                pittance of his pay. He employed assistants and paid them out of his
                                own pocket. At the last session of the Senate a resolution was
                                introduced here in which the Sergeant-at-arms was allowed the same
                                mileage and fees that Sheriffs are allowed. By some means that
                                resolution did not go to the House, and the accounting officers
                                refused to pay the amount to the Sergeant-at roms. I have no
                                interest in this matter, only that these men should be reimbursed
                                for the labor and expense attending the duties we imposed upon them
                                at that time. My opinion is that this committee had no power o act
                                after the adjournment. For the purpose of getting at this matter, I
                                move that the subject be referred to a select committee of
                                three.
                            MR. MURRAY. I would suggest as an amendment, that the chairman of the
                                    Bank Fraud Committee be respectfully
                                requested to report the amount each witness and the sergeant-at arms
                                and assistants are entitled to for services.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. That will be imposing a good deal of work upon that
                                committee. There are one hundred and fifty subpoenas in the case. 
                            Mr. GOODING. I have some objections to this proposition. It is
                                impossible for the chairman of the committee to tell what mileage
                                would be due. I understand that some witnesses came here and were
                                subpoenaed at the Capital.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. For those subpoenaed at the Capital, no charge is
                                made.
                            Mr. GOODING. That is what I wanted to get at. I think that committee
                                is still in power. I want no swindles about pay.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. As far as the imputation as to the chairman of that
                                committee making swindles, I hutl it back with contempt, and he may
                                take it as he pleases.
                            Mr. GOODING. The Senator from Washington is becoming excited without
                                cause. He had no charge made against him. He must have a very little
                                stock of conscience, or he would not feel any such thing; but I felt
                                that officers might impose upon the chairman. I have no imputations
                                to cast upon any Senator.
                            Mr. MARCH. I have every confidence in the Senator from Washington,
                                anc don't think he would do anything out of the way. I think it
                                ought to come from the whole committee, and not from any one member.
                                I see no necessity for a select committee. 
                            Mr. BOBBS. As a member of that committee, I do not see that the truth
                                of what is aimed at here, can be so well arrived at in any other
                                way,  as coming from those who
                                had charge of the original matters. I think these claims ought to
                                undergo the scrutiny or the same committee.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I have no objection to accepting the motion to refer to
                                the Committee on Bank Frauds. If the chairman is such a blockhead
                                that the Sergeant-at-arms can impose upon him, I think with the
                                assistance of the Senators from Delaware, Jennings and Marion, he
                                can be free from temptation, and that such scrutiny as the Senator
                                from Hancock, will protect an exhausted treasury.
                            Mr. WEIR. The only object I had in introducing the resolution was to
                                get at the fees to which the Sergeant-at-arms and some others were
                                entitled. If there is any danger of frauds by thechairman making the
                                report, I am willing for it to go to the whole committee.
                            Mr. GOODING. The Senate will permit me to say that I did not intend
                                any disrespect to the chairman, but I wanted the whole committee to
                                be responsible for what was done.
                            Mr. CRAVENS, of Jefferson. I understand this committee has never made
                                a report. Until they make a report, I move to lay the matter on this
                                table.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. The report has been printed but never submitted to the
                                Senate.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            STATIONARY.
                            Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Secretary of State
                                            be requested to Inform the Senate whether he has
                                            purchased and is ready to furnish stationery for the
                                            present session.
                                        The resolution was adopted.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            POLITICAL.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Mr. President, I offer the following resolutions:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we affirm the original
                                            and essential inferiority of the negro.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we deny that the negro
                                            was intended to be embraced within the abstractions of
                                            the Declaration of Independence, and assert that the
                                            right to freedom and equality was predicated only for
                                            the dominant race of white men.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we deny that negroes are
                                            citizens of the United States.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we affirm the
                                            compatibility of a confederacy of free and slave States
                                            and the possibility of their harmonious co-existence
                                            under a common Constitution.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we affirm the absolute
                                            sovereignty of the States, in respect to their domestic
                                            institutions, and deny the authority of the Federal
                                            Government to discriminate for or against the interests
                                            of slavery.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we desire to inculcate a
                                            policy of nonintervention as between the free and
                                            slaveholding States, as well as between the latter and
                                            the Federal Government.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we support the decision
                                            of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case, and in the
                                            sense that it guarantees to the owhers of slave property
                                            an equality with the owners of other property, in
                                            introducing it into the Territories; contending, also,
                                            that as slave property, it like all other property, must
                                            be subject to all such local laws of the Territories as
                                            do not infringe upon the Constitution of the United
                                            States; that slave property being thus placed on an
                                            equality with other property, if it requires higher and
                                            further affirmative legislation for its protection and
                                            security than is afforded to other property, is a
                                            misfortune attending that description of property, for
                                            which we have no remedy, and are not responsible.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we uphold all the
                                            guarantees of the Federal Constitution in respect to
                                            rights of the slaveholding States.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we maintain the dignity
                                            and independence of the Senatorial fuction against the
                                            encroachments of Executive usurpation.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we protest our
                                            opposition to Republicanism, at every point, and upon
                                            every principle.
                                    
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That we pledge fidelity to
                                            the organization, principles and nominees of the
                                            Democratic party.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay the resolutions on the table.
                            Mr. Bennet withdrew his motion for
                            Mr. GOODING, who said: I will make this motion, that these
                                resolutions be postponed until this day three weeks, at two o'clock.
                                We are called here upon a special and important business, and at the
                                close of the session I am willing to enter into political questions.
                                Some of these resolutians I will support, and some I will not. I ask
                                the Senate to postpone this and any other question of a similar
                                character until this day three weeks - until we transact other
                                important business. I think this proposition ought to be
                                satisfactory to all. I do not intend to dodge a vote upon any
                                proposition of this kind. When the time comes I am willing and
                                anxious to see every Senator upon this floor where he means to
                                stand.
                            Mr. BENNETT. I renew my motion.
                            Mr. WALLCE offered a resolution which was ruled out of order by the
                                Chair.
                            Mr. HEFFREN demanded the yeas and nays, and the same being ordered
                                and taken, resulted yeas 41, nays 9, as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS - Messrs. Anthony, Beeson, Bennett. Blair, Bobbs,
                                            Brown, Carnahan, Cobb, Connelly, Conner, Cooper, Cravens
                                            of Jefferson, Cravens of Madison, Culver, Gooding,
                                            Green, Hamilton, Hargrave, Hendry, Hill, Johnston,
                                            Jones, Kinley, Line, Lomax, McClure, McLean. March,
                                            Miller, Murray, O'Brien, Odell, Rice,
                                            Robinson,Shoemaker, Steele, Stevens, Thompson, Turner,
                                            Wagner, and Weir - 41.
                                        NAYS - Messrs. Fisk, Heffren, Jennings, Slack,
                                            Studabaker, Tarkington, and Wallace.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, said: That there may be no
                                mistake about it, I desire to say that I shall vote to lay these
                                resolu tions on the table; but I do not mean to be understood as
                                being against them. I do not indicate how I shall vote upon their
                                passage.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, when his name was called, said: I wish to state the
                                reason for my vote. Icame here determined, as far as my vote go,
                                that no political question should enter this body.
                            Mr. HEFFREN, when his name was called, said: I wish to state the
                                reason for my vote. I copied these resolutions word for word,
                                without the crossing of a "t" or the dotting of an "i" from the
                                Douglas Platform as laid down in the Chicago Times, I want to see if there are any Douglas men in this
                                Senate.
                            Mr. GOODING. There are no Douglas men here - we are all Democrats -
                                we follow no man.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I vote "no."
                            Mr. MARCH, when his name was called, said: I had supposed that the
                                Union was out of danger at least that is the last report from Dr.
                                Hammond, of South Carolina, who, I understand, now stands at the
                                head of the political doctors who are to save the Union. If there
                                was anydanger, I should feel myself bound to vote against laying on
                                the table, but as at present advised I think the Union is out of
                                danger, and vote 'yes.'
                            
                            Mr. ODELL, when his name was called, said: I shall vote to lay on the
                                table, on the ground that I do not wish political questions taken up
                                at this session.
                            Mr. WALLACE, when his name was called said: I wish to be excused for
                                the following reasons: As I understand the resolutions, they are
                                good Democracy, but as I am unwilling to assist in the discussion of
                                politics, I ask to be excused.
                            The Senate refused to accept of the excuse.
                            Mr. WALLACE. I have no hesitation in saying "no," because they are my
                                sentiments.

                                        Resolved, That this House employ Dr.
                                            Bush to report its proceedings aud publish the same, and
                                            that he permit such other papers to copy the same that
                                            may choose to do so.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The SPEAKER. The amendment of the gentleman from Monroe is out of
                                order.
                            Mr. LAWHEAD. I have quite a large number of German people in my
                                district, who can not read English, and I desire that they should be
                                furnished with the proceedings of this House.
                            Mr. HUNTER. There are a great many papers published in this city, and
                                if we take any we ought to take all upon the same principle. The few
                                papers that, members may take here and distribute can not amount to
                                anything. What are three papers every morning? I have 3,000
                                constituents. I can not send to the tenth part of them during the
                                session, and if I could send a paper to every man, what would one
                                paper in a month amount to? The object of reporting is that the
                                people may read these proceedings. Printers can not hire reporters
                                except the House take extra copies to remunerate them. Therefore, in
                                my judgement, it is better not to take any, but employ a Reporter to
                                do the work accurately, and let the newspapers copy. I move to lay
                                the resolution on the table
                            The motion was lost, and the question recurred on the amendment of
                                Mr. Nebeker, of Warren.
                            Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren. The proposition of the gentleman from Monroe
                                would not reduce the expense. Other papers have the right to copy
                                these proceedings; and therefore, it could confer no privilege.
                            Mr. RITTER. I think it would be well for us to do what we intend to
                                do in this matter, at once. I wish to study economy in my action
                                here. I wish to take as many copies of these papers as will pay the
                                reporting and no more. I do not indorse the argument that our
                                constituents will be benefitted by these papers. They can not be
                                benefitted in the slightest degree. I move to modify the
                                proposition, so as to take two copies of the Daily
                                    Sentinel and Daily Journal, and one copy
                                each of the Weekly Free Press and Weekly Volksblatt.
                            Mr. BAIRD. I shall oppose it, sir, if you are going to make
                                distinctions. I don't see why we should take two copies of the
                                English papers and but one copy of the German. We ought to patronize
                                the German printers also.
                            Mr. JEFFRIES. I move that the subject be referred to a Select
                                Committee.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I oppose the amendment of the gentleman from Wayne for
                                this reason: It does not settle anything. I have a proposition which
                                I think will satisfy the House, but there are so many amendments I
                                can not get it in. I will read it for information.
                            "That the Door-keeper be authorized to contract with the proprietors
                                of such papers as intend to report the proceedings of the
                                Legislature, for three copies of their respective papers, to be
                                delivered to each member of the Housetwo copies to be eveloped and
                                stamped."
                            I am opposed to taking any papers which do not report our proceedings
                                in full; for if we take one such paper, we might just as well go out
                                and subscribe to papers all over the State. It is only on the ground
                                of service in a legislative capacity, that these subscriptions can
                                be justified. I would be happy to see these German papers with their
                                reporters on this floor, and I hope they will come in. The other
                                object I wish to gain is, that two out of every three of these
                                papers shall be enveloped and stamped.
                            [A Senate message here announced the reciprocal action of that body
                                in the matter of the Joint Committee to wait on the Governor.]
                            Mr. DAVIS. I am satisfied of this fact, that these papers will be
                                taken in some shape or other and the only point is as to the best
                                proposition. As for the real, practical good in these subscriptions,
                                I can see but one, and that is, when a member comes to his seat he
                                can see whether he is recorded rightwhether his position as
                                reported, accords with his true position. In this light the
                                proposition is of some importance, perhaps. Again, it depends
                                greatly unon the manner in which we discharge our duties here
                                whether it would be good policy to have our proceedings reported If we go on doing nothing, or
                                worse the time will come when we might wish our proceedings had not
                                been reported. My friend from Elkhart (Mr. Murray) knows more about
                                this than I do, for he has been a reporter and printer, and is now I
                                believe connected with the press.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I am a farmer.
                            Mr. DAVIS. The gentleman says he is connected with the agricultural
                                profession. I hope he is not ashamed of having been a printer, for
                                that also is a very honorable profession. It may be, sir, that these
                                city printers will not furnish resports unless we compensate them
                                for it. Then again, suppose we employ a party to take down what is
                                said and done here, as some seem to think best, it then becomes a
                                question whether the printers will publish what he may report. There
                                are two sides to the question. They may do so or not. It I were a
                                printer, I should certainly consult my own convenience upon it. I am
                                not careful how this question shall be disposed of, but I think it
                                ought to be disposed of now.
                            Mr. COLGROVE I acknowledge the force of the argument of the gentleman
                                from Floyd, (Mr. Davis,) so far as it goes. It is certainly
                                important to members that they be correctly reported. I go further,
                                and say that upon every important question our constituents should
                                know what we are doing here, and it is no argument against this to
                                say we are not able to furnish every man with a copy of these daily
                                newspaper reports. I think there is no money expended by the
                                Legislature that our people pay more freely than that which enables
                                us to distribute these newspaper reports. In relation to the
                                question of how many copies and what papers we shall subscribe
                                for,there are a variety of opinions, and for the purpose of settling
                                and harmonizing these, I think a committee should be appointed. The
                                proposition of the gentleman from Elkhart, (Mr. Murray,) is too
                                indefinite. It proposes to take certain copies of all newspapers
                                furnishing reporters here.
                            Mr. MURRAY. All newspapers in this city.
                            Mr. COLGROVE. All published in this city, and that would be going too
                                far. It is well known that in nearly all the counties of the State
                                we have a considerable German population, it is necessary that these
                                people should be informed of the proceedings of their law makers. I
                                am in favor of this, and if they do not furnish Reporters here, they
                                at least have to furnish competent persons to translate these
                                reports into the German language, and that expense is as great or
                                greater than that of furnishing a Reporter on this floor. Again,
                                this body is composed of two different elements - our old line
                                friends - and I feel disposed to give them a fair shake, though I
                                don't like them very well. [ A laugh.] Then we have Republicans and
                                Anti-Lecompton Democrats - I think if would be just and proper that
                                we should take a paper representing each of these three interests,
                                and we should take a German paper to represent that interest. I
                                think a special committee could give us a proposition that would
                                stafisfy every member of the house.
                            Mr. DAVIS. Mr. Speaker, I claim to be a part of the fossil remains of
                                a very respectable party to which the gentleman did not refer - I
                                mean the old Whig party. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. RITTER. I now insist on my admendment to the amendment - to take
                                two copies of the Sentinel and the Journal, and one copy of the Free Press
                                and Volks Blatt.
                            Mr. AUSTIN. I desire a final settlement of this matter. There is at
                                least one point connected with it that I desire to have settled now,
                                and that is the number of papers we will have laid upon our desks
                                ready enveloped and stamped. If I am to be encumbered with half a
                                dozen papers daily laid loose on my desk, I shall necessarily have
                                to occupy a large portion of my time in taking care of them, or be
                                at the expense of employing a clerk for that purpose. I must insist
                                that these papers be enveloped and stamped.
                            Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren. At the proper time I shall be willing to
                                accept that.
                            Mr. LAWHEAD. I, also, would be willing to accept that.
                            Mr. AUSTIN. I am satisfied the House does not comprehend the
                                question; and, in order that we may dispose of it in the shortest
                                time, I move to lay the resolution and amendments on the table, in
                                order that gentlemen may draw up another to meet the approbation of
                                the House.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                            empowered to contract with such publishers of newspapers
                                            in this city as intend to report the proceedings of this
                                            Legislature in full, for three copies of their papers,
                                            respectively - two copies enveloped and stamped - to be
                                            delivered upon the desks of the respective members of
                                            this body.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HARNEY. At the beginning of every session of the Legislature we
                                usually have this discussion, and it always results nearly in the
                                same waythat is, in taking three copies each of the State Sentinel and State Journal. I
                                think we had just as well come to that at once. I am willing to vote
                                for three copies of each of these, requiring two to be enveloped and
                                stamped.
                            Mr. LAWHEAD. I would like to inquire whether there is a German
                                Reporter here?
                            The SPEAKER. I believe there is not.
                            Mr. LAWHEAD. I have a large number of German constituents, and I want
                                they should see these proceedings. I want the German paper embraced.
                                They have frequently spoken to me on the subject.
                            Mr. HARNEY. I propose the following as a substitute: 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper
                                            subscribe for the usual number, that is, three copies of
                                            the Sentinel and three copies of the
                                                Journal for each member of this
                                            House - two copies of each to be enclosed and
                                            stamped.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MURRAY. The opinion seems to be entertained that my proposition
                                will cut off the German papers. I take different ground. I believe
                                the proprietors of the German paper will have Reporters on this
                                floor, if we propose to enter into a contract to take their paper. I
                                hope they will, for I too, have many German constituents. But, sir,
                                I say we have no right to subscribe for a German paper or any other
                                paper, unless they come in here and report. It has been the policy
                                hertofore to take all such papers; and here is a little daily paper
                                called the Citizen, which has a Reporter on this
                                floor, to report proceedings in full. I am willing to take that, and
                                the Locomotive too; but I am for cutting off all
                                    papers unless they have
                                Reporters. I hope gentlemen who think my proposition cuts off the
                                German paper will take a different view of the case. I have seen the
                                extravagances of former Legislatures in regard to taking papers, as
                                well as in other things. My constituents sent me here, in part, for
                                the purpose of retrenching these extravagances, and though, as an
                                old printer, I would like to befriend the craft, I shall not go out
                                Of the line of this duty.
                            On the point, that these papers and reports are of no public benefit,
                                I undertake to say, that no people have ever yet grumbled about the
                                little expense for this object. I have not gone into a single
                                township but their last request was to hear from the Legislature
                                thvough such papers as report our proceedings. Suppose we are able
                                only to send a paper now and then in a particular direction; we can
                                discriminate and send proceedings affecting local interests into
                                those particular localities.
                            Mr. BAIRD. The gentleman from Elkhart, speaks upon principle; and it
                                strikes me he is driving to that point where extravagance will never
                                end. He is just holding out an inducement for every newspaper to
                                come in here and report proceedings. I propose three copies each of
                                the Journal, Sentinel and Volksblatt.
                            The SPEAKER. The motion is not in order.
                            Mr. HALL, of Grant. I will gro for the amendment, with two copies of
                                the Volksblatt.
                            Mr. BRANHAM, Why confine the proposition to the city papers? I
                                understand that one of the papers published in my county intends to
                                have a Reporter here, through whom my constituents will get our
                                proceedings up to twelve o'clock the preceding day. I am opposed,
                                however, to taking any but the Sentinel and the
                                    Journal, but if the proposition is to be made
                                wider, I would be willing to take the Free Press
                                and the Volksblatt.
                            Mr.RYNEARSON. Mr. Speaker, I move to lay the propositions on the
                                table, to enable me to offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                            instructed to contract for three copies of the Daily State Sentinel, three copies of the
                                            Daily State Journal, and two copies of
                                            the Weekly Volksblatt, provided such
                                            papers be pledged to contain full reports of the
                                            proceedings of this Housetwo copies of each to be
                                            enveloped and stamped.

                            Mr. DOBBINS submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Senate be invited to
                                            meet the House in joint session in the Hall of the House
                                            of Representatives, at half-past two o'clock, this
                                            afternoon, to hear the message of His Excellency, the
                                            Governor, and that the Door-keeper procure seats for
                                            them at the right of the Speaker's chair.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            PRAYER.
                            Mr. DAVIS. Mr. Speaker, has provision been made for opening the
                                present session of the General Assembly with prayer? I think we need
                                it very much over here.
                            After some conversation on the subject, a resolution was adopted for
                                a joint select committee to invite some clergyman of Indianapolis to
                                open the session by prayer - to be offered at two o'clock, in a
                                joint session of the two Houses of the General'Assembly.
                            The SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Murray and Blythe said Committee on the
                                part of the House of Representatives.
                        
                        
                             ASSISTANT CLERKS.
                            Mr. MORTON submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Assistant Clerk of
                                            this House be permitted to appoint such number of
                                            assistants as he may deem necessary, not exceeding
                                            three.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. KEEFER proposed two assistants.
                            Mr. BAIRD. I would like to have the Clerk state the number necessary.
                                I understand thatit takes one Clerk to record the yeas and nays,and
                                that three is the lowest number that can get along.
                            The SPEAKER. The Clerk informs me that four is the usual number, and
                                it will be probably difficult to get along with less.
                            Mr. AUSTIN. I think it better to dispense with this resolution till
                                we can know more about this service. It is well known that the
                                expense for clerks heretofore has been made much larger than it
                                ought to be. During the past session I introduced resolution after
                                resolution, to try to dispense with unnecessary clerks; but I found
                                that after they are once appointed, there is no chance to reduce
                                their number. If you make too many appointments you will find a
                                reduction impossible.
                            Mr. MORETON. I have the assurance of the Assistant Clerk, that if he
                                can get along with a less number, he will discharge one. It would
                                certainly be poor economy to adjourn the body and allow a hundred
                                men here to wait on the action of clerks. I am in favor of economy;
                                but we should not let it go to the extent of loosing more out of the
                                pocket than we put into it.
                            Mr. Keefer's amendment was agreed to, and so the resolution was
                                adopted.
                            Mr.DOBBINS asked ineffectually for a suspension of the rules, to
                                enable him to introduce a bill.
                        
                        
                            PRAYER.
                            A message from the Senate responded to the resolution of the House,
                                for a joint select committee on prayer.
                            Mr. MURRAY submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Senate be invited to
                                            attend in the Hall of the House of Representatives, this
                                            day, at two o'clock P. M., for the opening of the
                                            business of the session with prayer.
                                        The resolution was adopted, and the order was made
                                            accordingly.
                                        The House then took a recess till 2 P. M.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. MURRAY, from the Special Joint Committee on Prayer, reported that
                                the Rev. AARON WOOD had consented to be present at this hour (two
                                o'clock P. M.) and offer prayer on the occasion of the delivery of
                                the Governor's Message.
                            The doors were now opened, and the Senate and its officers entered
                                the Hall and took seats prepared for them - the President of the
                                Senate on the right of the Speaker.
                            After the order of prayers by the Rev. Aaron Wood - 
                            The PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE said: The General Assembly will now
                                receive the Message from the Governor.
                            His Excellency, the GOVERNOR, then stood upon the Speaker's forum,
                                and read the following

                            
                                MESSAGE.
                                Senators and Representatives:
                                Previous to the year 1852, provision was made in this State for
                                    annual sessions of the legislature, but the members of the
                                    Convention who framed our existing Constitution believed that
                                    biennial sessions, after that period, would, in ordinary times,
                                    be sufficient. They provided, however, that when in the opinion
                                    of the Governor, the public welfare should demand it, he might
                                    call a special session of the General Assembly.
                                The thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly which adjourned
                                    on the 9th day of March, 1857, did not pass any law for the
                                    purpose of raising a revenue for the years 1857 and 1858. Until
                                    that time it was confidently hoped by the people of the State
                                    that their Representatives would at all times be willing to
                                    provide the necessary means to sustain every department of the
                                    Government, established by their Constitution. They also
                                    expected that provision would be made to support every
                                    Benevolent Institution they had approved. They felt that
                                    although improvident legislation had in former days impaired the
                                    credit of their State, as similar legislation had injured the
                                    reputation of others, yet, that for many years, the credit of
                                    Indiana, maintained in every particular, was to them a matter of
                                    just pride and congratulation. They felt that although Indiana,
                                    in the days of her improvidence, had been unable to maintain the
                                    high character of a sovereign State in responding to all her
                                    pecuniary obligations, yet she had now attained to that position
                                    of wealth and influence among her sister States, that any
                                    failure to redeem every undertaking would be injurious to her
                                    credit and her honor.
                                Notwithstanding these and other considerations, the members of
                                    the last Legislature, for reasons into which it is not my duty
                                    to inquire, failed to enact the laws necessary to sustain the
                                    various interests to which I have alluded. Shortly after such
                                    adjournment, I informed the people of the State that there was
                                    necessity for legislation, and expressed a readiness, whenever
                                    the laws could be passed, to call the members together.
                                    Believing that there was such a want of harmony among them, that
                                    necessary legislation could not be secured, I declined to
                                    exercise the power entrusted to the Governor, to call a special
                                    session of the General Assembly. But a new Legislature having
                                    been elected, I have at the earliest practicable day exercised
                                    the power to which I have before alluded.
                                Although that Legislature failed to appropriate  the means which were then in the
                                    Treasury to sustain the interests for which they had been raised
                                    the Administrative and Executive officers of the State believed
                                    that such was the regard that the people of Indiana had for the
                                    Government they had establishedsuch their anxiety for the
                                    maintenance of their Constitution, and the support of their
                                    laws, that it was their imperative duty to apply the money in
                                    their possession to the purposes for which it was collected From
                                    that adjournment of the Legislature, those officers have
                                    endeavored to sustain every interest of Indiana, as provided for
                                    by her Constitution and her laws. They found that the laws of
                                    the State provided that the Auditor, Treasurer and Governor,
                                    were authorized to procure money to pay the interest upon the
                                    public debt. Believing that the welfare of the State would be
                                    promoted by paying such interest, a loan was negotiated on the
                                    22d of June, 1858, with the Board of Commissioners of the
                                    Sinking Fund for one hundred and sixty-five thousand dollars,
                                    which was applied to the payment of such interest. After the
                                    State has undertaken to pay all the interest and principal of
                                    her debt, her sovereign integrity demands that her obligations
                                    should be redeemed. Section 1 of article 9 of the Constitution
                                    declares that "It shall be the duty of the General Assembly to
                                    provide by law for the support of Institutions for the education
                                    of the Deaf and Dumb, and of the Blind, and also for the
                                    treatment of the Insane."
                                No appropriation was made by the Legislature to sustain those
                                    Institutions, but the money was in the Treasury - the clear
                                    provision of the Constitution that those Institutions should be
                                    supported, the officers of the State thought should be
                                    maintained and executed, and accordingly they applied the funds
                                    in their possession to that purpose.
                                The officers of the State have been enabled, by an economical
                                    administration of the public funds, to thus far sustain every
                                    department of the government, and pay the interest on our
                                    indebtedness, leaving a balance in the Treasury of $131,342 28,
                                    without making any loan except the one to which I have before
                                    alluded.
                                No tax having been levied for the years 1857 and 1858, all the
                                    resources for sustaining the Government, or maintaining its
                                    credit, will, at an early day, be exhausted, unless the
                                    Legislature shall provide a remedy. I recommend to you,
                                    therefore, that at as early a day as possible, you take into
                                    consideration the condition of the Treasury, and that a tax be
                                    levied for the year 1858.
                                The report of the Auditor of State will exhibit to you the amount
                                    which it is estimated will be necessary to raise. If the tax is
                                    levied at once, it can be collected in time to meet the ordinary
                                    expenditures of the government. It will be necessary to
                                    negotiate a loan to meet the interest which will be due upon the
                                    public debt upon the first day of January, 1859. No difficulty
                                    will be found in negotiating such loan, provided the levy is
                                    made for the year 1858.
                                Justice to the residents and owners of the property of the State
                                    demands that the expenses of the Government should be paid by
                                    them equally, according to the value of their property. To
                                    secure so desirable a result, it has long been the policy in
                                    Indiana to have frequent valuations of all the real property
                                    within the State. Accordingly, on the 13th of February, 1851, an
                                    act was passed to appraise the real estate, and to make the
                                    value of the same equal and uniform. Since that time no act of
                                    the Legislature has been passed ordering a new appraisement. In
                                    the meantime the increase in the value of that kind of property
                                    has been very large. If that increase had been uniform, a
                                    necessity for the new appraisement would not exist. But since
                                    the passage of that law, a great difference has arisen in
                                    reference to the relative value of real estate. When the last
                                    assessment was made, there was but one railroad completed to
                                    Indianapolis, from any point in the State, nor were any other of
                                    the existing works finished. You cannot but appreciate the
                                    effect that those roads have had upon the value of the property
                                    of the State. Indeed, it has so increased the value of such
                                    property that it is confidently believed that a new assessment
                                    would show that the taxables of the State now amount to four
                                    hundred million dollars. If this view of the subject is correct,
                                    it is manifestly unjust that the revenues paid for the support
                                    of the Government should be levied upon the appraisement of
                                    1851.
                                At my request the Directors of the State Prison have made a
                                    partial report as to the condition of that Institution. You will
                                    observe by an examination of that report that the new cell house
                                    has been finished, but even now, after the same has been
                                    completed, such is the limited capacity of that Institution that
                                    it is impossible to retain with safety, or employ with profit,
                                    more than three hundred and fifty convicts. The number which
                                    will be confined there by the first of January, 1859, will, in
                                    all probability, amount to five hundred. You will therefore see
                                    the absolute necessity of either greatly enlarging the existing
                                    prison, or of erecting an additional one in some other part of
                                    the State. In view of the prison being located upon the southern
                                    boundary of the State, thereby causing a heavy expense in
                                    transporting the convicts from the various counties, and
                                    believing that a portion of the labor of the inmates could be
                                    more profitably employed in some other locality, and relying
                                    upon the advice and opinion of those most experienced in
                                    managing such institutions, that three hundred to three hundred
                                    and fifty convicts are as many as should be confined in one
                                    locality, I accordingly join with the Directors and Warden of
                                    the I rison in recommending to you that a law be passed at an
                                    early day, providing for the erection of another State Prison,
                                    and that the same be located somewhere in the northern portion
                                    of the State. Little can be done toward the erection of said
                                    Prison until the spring of 1859. If it should he regarded by you
                                    as desirable to use the labor of a portion of the convicts in
                                    the erection of said prison, one hundred and fifty to two
                                    hundred of them could be employed for that purpose. If you
                                    should decide to pass such a law, provision should be made for
                                    the purchasing of more land for the use of the new, than belongs
                                    to the State adjoining the present prison. There are generally
                                    confined in the prison many who could be profitably employed in
                                    raising necessaries for the support of the Institution.

                            I have thus briefly called to your attention those interests of the
                                State which demand, in my opinion, your immediate action. I have
                                done thus in the hope that a few days only of your time will be
                                required, deferring to make any other recommendation until you
                                assemble at the regular session, which will be on the 6th day of
                                January, 1859. In conclusion, I hope that harmony may prevail in
                                your councils, and that wisdom and patriotism may guide your
                                actions.

                            The Governor having concluded the Message, the Senators retired to
                                their chamber.
                            Mr. BOYD submitted the following, which was adopted: 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Governor's Message
                                            and accompanying documents be referred to the Committee
                                            of the Whole House and made the special order for
                                            Wednesday at two o'clock P. M.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            WABASH AND ERIE CANAL.
                            Mr. EDWARDS submitted the following, asking for the yeas and nays on
                                the question of its adoption:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it is hereby declared
                                            that this House is unalterably opposed to purchasing the
                                            Wabash and Erie Canal by the state.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr, GIFFORD proposed to amend the amendment by adding these words:
                                "And that it would not be accepted as a gift."
                            Mr. EDWARDS proposed to amend the amendment by adding these words:
                                "Unless the State is paid for it."
                            The amendment to the amendment was adopted; and then the amendment,
                                as amended, was adopted - yeas 74, nays 17 - taken on the demand of
                                Mr. MURRAY.
                            The question now recurred on the adoption of the resolution as
                                amended.
                            Mr. DOBBINS complained Of the resolution as useless, and the fact as
                                notorious, that every man on this floor was opposed to taking back
                                that canal, and also that there was already a resolution of
                                opposition to such a thing on the statute book.
                            Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, perhaps every man in the State is aware of
                                the fact, that at the last session of the Legislature a proposition
                                was made to take back ihe Wabash and Erie Canal, and there has not
                                been a public meeting since held anywhere in the State, before whom
                                the subject has been brought that has not con demened it. I also
                                condemn it, and I ask gentlemen here to show where they stand upon
                                it, by their votes on the resolution I offered. The gentleman from
                                Franklin proposed that this Canal be not taken back as a gift, and
                                my amendment to that was, unless the State be paid for it. But I
                                voted against the amendment as amended. I wish gentlemen to vote for
                                the simple proposition as I offered it, and not attempt to evade it
                                by amendments and equivocations. If gentlemen would avoid the
                                difficulty they have brought upon themselves, let them do so by
                                reconsideration.
                            Mr. THOMPSON, of Madison, moved to re consider the vote just
                                taken.
                            Mr. MURRAY opposed reconsideration. He was utterly opposed to taking
                                that Canal back and willing to go to the record on the proposition
                                as it is. He moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
                            Mr. DOBBINS demanded the yeas and nays, and the same being ordered
                                and taken, resulted yeas 50, nays 49.
                            So the motion to reconsider was laid on the table, and the question
                                recurred on the resolution as amended.
                            Mr. SNYDER proposed further to amend by striking out all after the
                                word "Resolved," and inserting these words:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it would be inexpedient
                                            and unwise to, take back the Wabash and Erie Canal, upon
                                            any terms, or to reassume in any form the debt to
                                            satisfy which it was transferred to the bond
                                            holders.
                                    
                                
                            
                            After some discussion of a point of order raised against this
                                amendment by Mr. Davis, which was overruled - 
                            The amendment was agreed to.
                            Mr. BLYTHE demanded the yeas and nays on the resolution as thus
                                amended, and the same being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 96,

                            GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
                            Mr. TURPIE submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That 3,000 copies of the
                                            Governor's Message be printed in English, and 1,000
                                            copies in German, for the use of this House.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr, AUSTIN opposed, and suggested 1,000 copies in English, and 500 in
                                German. Every man in the State who would read the message at all
                                would have read in the newspapers long before it could be published
                                and distributed in this way. Whether he succeeded or not he was for
                                making every effort to retrench unnecessary expenditures.
                            
                            Mr. TURPIE. I am as much in favor of economy as the gentleman from
                                Wayne (Mr. Austin.) I do not know why precedent should be
                                disregarded at this time. Five thousand and three thousand in German
                                are the usual numbers ordered for the message. As to the argument
                                that it will be read in the newspapers, I have to say, that there is
                                but one newspaper in my counties. If five thousand is the number for
                                the regular session, three thousand it seems to me can not be
                                extravagant for a special session. It seems to me that the Chief
                                Executive, who has taken the responsibility to call us together at
                                this time, ought to have a full opportunity to spread before the
                                people the reasons that have led him to take this step. I can make a
                                proper disposition of my share - forty copies - and if the gentleman
                                from Wayne has any to spare, I shall be much obliged to him for
                                them.
                            On a division of the House, the question was decided in favor of 3000
                                and 1000 copies.
                            Mr. RITTER demanded the yeas and nays on the resolution, and the same
                                being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 59, nays 40 - as
                                follows:

                            Mr. McLEAN offered the following: 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That in compliance with an
                                            established custom of the Legislature, with the single
                                            exception if the Senate of 1857, and according to
                                            uniform custom and immemorial usage, the President of
                                            the Senate be requested to appoint the Standing
                                            Committees, and announce the same at the meeting of the
                                            Senate this afternoon.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MURRAY. It was out of order, in his opinion.
                            The PRESIDENT decided it in order.
                            An appeal was taken from the decision of the Chair.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON insisted that the Chair was right.
                            Mr. McLEAN withdrew his resolution.
                        
                        
                             NEWSPAPERS.
                            Mr. SLACK, from the select committee on newspapers, to whom was
                                referred the resolution having reference to the number of papers
                                which should be taken, and the mode and manner of the publishing of
                                proceedings, reported the following resolutions:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper contract
                                            with the publishers of the Daily State
                                                Sentinel, Daily Journal and
                                                Daily Citizen, for two copies each
                                            of their respective Dailies, one paper to be enveloped
                                            and stamped, provided said papers publish the daily
                                            proceedings of this body.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved, That desks be provided for
                                            the reporters of newspapers, who may desire to publish
                                            the proceedings of the Senate.
                                    
                                
                            
                            MR. JOHNSON. I move to amend the first resolution by adding the words
                                in the proper place, "at the expense of members."
                            A motion was made to lay the amendment on the table, upon which the
                                yeas and nays were demanded, 
                                and being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 44, nays 5, as
                                follows:

                                        NAYS - Messrs. Beeson, Carnaham, Johnston, Lomax and
                                            Williams.
                                    
                                
                            
                            So the amendment was laid on the table.
                            MR. MILLER. I desire to amend by striking out the postage stamps. I
                                do not intend to vote for postage stamps. We had too many stolen two
                                years ago.
                            SEVERAL VOICES"No," "no."
                            MR. MILLER. I am not particular about it.
                        
                        
                            MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR.
                            A message from the Governor was received informing the Senate that he
                                had appointed Samuel Osborn as his private secretary.
                            Mr. STEVENS. I move to amend by adding "one copy of the American and Volksblatt." I do not feel
                                like voting for the adoption of the report, unless the two papers
                                named are included. I have one hundred and fifty German
                                constituents, who can't read English at all, and I want them posted
                                up through the German paper; and the other paper is extensively
                                circulated in our county.
                            Mr BOBBS I hope Senators will see the propriety of being equitable in
                                this matter. A large number of our German constituents have no other
                                means of knowing what we are doing except through their papers, and
                                I think it fair that we should subscribe for them both.
                            Mr. WEIR. I move to lay the amendment on the table.
                            The motion was withdrawn for
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. The committee reported in favor of taking only those
                                daily papers having reporters on this floor. The taking of the
                                papers is worth nothing, but it is simply to have the reports
                                published. If we wish to have our proceedings published, we have got
                                to have Reporters upon this floor, and we ought to take just such a
                                number of papers as would pay the publishers for keeping Reporters
                                upon this floor. I am in favor of the report of the committee,
                                believing it to be the most just and wise course; And I will now
                                renew the motion of the Senator from Laporte,to lay the amendment on
                                the table.
                            The yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken,
                                resulted - yeas 22, nays 27, as follows:

                            So the amendment was not laid on the table.
                            Mr. GOODING. I move an amendment to the amendment. Insert "one copy
                                of the Weekly National Democrat."
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I move to amend as follows: Strike out in the first
                                resolution the word "two" and insert"three." And strike out "one"
                                and insert "two." I would be willing to take a half a dozen copies
                                if they would give such full reports as were given yesterday. I am
                                in favor of taking three copies of such papers as have Reporters
                                upon this floor. I think we owe it to them.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON demanded a division of the question , the question
                                being, first upon the amendment of the Senator from Washington. The
                                yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken, resulted -

                            MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE.
                            A Clerk from the House of Representatives appeared and said he was
                                authorized to inform the Senate that the House had appointed a
                                committee of three to act with a committee on the part of the
                                Senate, to advise and agree upon joint ules for the government of
                                both Houses, and hat the Senate be requested to concur.

                            Mr. MURRAY. I would like to move that the stamping part of the report
                                be stricken out. I know there is a good deal of complaint about
                                expense. The amount of stamps given at the last session to each
                                member and officer, was perhaps thirteen or fifteen dollars. I think
                                I had some ten or twelve dollars worth left at the close of the
                                session. If three dollars is not enough for us we ought to go to our
                                own pockets tor the balance.
                            Mr. WIER. For the purpose of putting an end to discussion, I will
                                call for the previous question. The time consumed now is worth more
                                than all the papers will come to.
                            The question being upon the adoption of the report, the yeas and nays
                                were demanded, and being ordered and taken, resulted as follows:

                            Mr. MURRAY. I now move the adoption of he following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Secretary of State
                                            be requested to furnish funds to the Door-keeper to
                                            purchase three dollars worth of postage stamps for the
                                            use of each of the members and officers of the Senate
                                            during this session.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The yeas and nays were demanded.
                            
                            Mr. STUDABAKER moved to strike out the words "and officers."
                            The motion was not agreed to.
                            The yeas and nays being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 38, nays
                                11, as follows:

                            STANDING COMMITTEES.
                            Mr. McLEAN. I now renew my motion for the standing committees.
                            Mr. CRAVENS moved as a substitute a complete list of the standing
                                committees of the Senate.
                            Mr. SLACK moved to lay them on the table.The yeas and nays were
                                demanded, and being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 23, nays 25
                                as follows:

                                        NAYS - Messrs. Anthony, Beeson, Bennet, Blair, Bobbs,

                            So the substitute was not laid on the table.
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved a postponement of the matter until Friday next, at
                                10 o'clock.
                            Mr. WALLACE. I wish to state to the Republican side that I am in
                                favor of the postponement. I am satisfied they have the power, if
                                they have the will, to carry these proceedings through. I have no
                                intention at present to characterize their course in regard to this
                                matter as I think of it. There is no reason why they should not be
                                at least courteous to us; and I urge this postponement for the
                                purpose of asking them to give those of us on the Democratic side an
                                opportunity to consult together in order that we may ascertain what
                                preferences we have. I will do the mover (Mr. Cravens,) the justice
                                to say that he proposed to me that a certain number of our side
                                should be appointed to consult in this matter. He on his part, will
                                tell you that I said I would go with him; but he never told me the
                                time nor place. I never understood how these committees were formed,
                                and I don't know by whom - I was not consulted, and as far as my
                                knowledge goes, no Democratic Senator has been consulted.This is but
                                a repetition of what was done at the last session of the
                                Legislature, and I have never thought of that proceeding since
                                without indignation. It is a lack of courtesy toward us. If it is
                                intended as an insult, there is but one remedy offered me, and that
                                is to refuse to serve upon any committee on which I may be placed. I
                                will refuse, and, if I am not much mistaken, I speak the sentiments
                                of every Democrat on this floor. I will not be made the subject of
                                such high handed wrong. When assigning us places the gentlemen might
                                have come to us and inquired what committee we would like to be put
                                on. I do not mean to say that it is a matter of any great importance
                                that I should be upon any committee. I am here to assert my
                                independence and honor; and I simply desire to enter my protest in
                                this manner and at this time against this action. As a matter of
                                courtesy I ask that the subject be postponed.
                            Mr. CRAVENS. As far as courtesy is concerned, I am willing to meet
                                the gentleman on half-way ground. I consulted the Senator, as one of
                                the committee, and other members of that committee consulted other
                                gentlemen of the Democratic party. It now becomes a simple question
                                of right whether this body shall have power to say where the control
                                of the legislation of the country shall be. All we ask is to give us
                                the control of this matter. I would not have introduced this matter
                                to day, had it not been for the resolution submitted by the
                                gentleman from Vigo. I had hoped it would be settled in silence, as
                                I have no doubt the mind of every Senator is made up as to how he
                                will vote upon the question.
                            Mr. JONES wished harmony and good feeling to prevail.
                            Mr. MURRAY thought that the President understood that no disrespect
                                was intended to the Chair. I am sorry to hear Senators say they will
                                not serve on committees. I ask gentlemen not to be too hasty and say
                                they will not serve.
                            Mr. GOODING. I desire to know how it is that the Senator from
                                Montgomery asserts that Democrats are in the minority here. I
                                disdain.
                            Mr. WALLACE. I said no such thing. I said that the Republicans had
                                the power to carry through such proceedings.
                            Mr. GOODING. The Senator quibbles upon words. They have not the power
                                unless gentlemen go to reading men out of the party. I will say that
                                the committees are made tolerably fair, considering they come from
                                that side of the house.
                            Mr. CRAVENS. Thank you.
                            Mr. GOODING. It is a little remarkable that there is no sterling
                                anti-bank man on the Bank Committee.
                            Mr. GOODING. I am Anti-Lecompton. If gentlemen will come back, we
                                will take them.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Will the gentleman take us back on probation?
                            Mr. GOODING. I should be afraid to take the gentleman from
                                Washington. [Laughter.] I have known the presiding officer from
                                boyhood. I do not believe he will do wrong in the appointment of
                                committees. Independent of the custom of the Senate, it would be
                                proper, acting upon popular sovereignty, to take the appointing
                                power, but I am not willing to impeach the President. If he should
                                do wrong, I am on hand to thrash him. [Laughter.] I shall vote to
                                postpone the consideration of this matter. It is my opinion the
                                presiding officer should appoint the committees.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I will change the motion to make it Friday. I have
                                consulted with Democratic Senators, and they know nothing of the
                                fact as to the formation of committees. The Committee on
                                Penitentiary has not the Senator from that district on it. If they
                                will not consent, I will join hands with the Senator from
                                Montgomery,  and will not serve.
                                I hope Republicans will consent to postponement, that we may appoint
                                a committee to act with them on the subject. If they have a
                                majority, I am willing to submit, and they will be responsible for
                                the legislation.
                            Mr. MURRAY. The only objection I have to putting off is, that it
                                delays organization. I think tomorrow, two o'clock, will answer.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON suggested that a committee be appointed of five, whose
                                majority shall be Republican, for the purpose of forming
                                committees.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I accept.
                            The resolution and amendment were postponed until Friday.
                        
                        
                            GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
                            Mr. SLACK. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution: 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That two thousand copies of
                                            the Governor's Message be printed for the use of the
                                            Senate, fifteen hundred in English and five hundred in
                                            German.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by unanimous consent.
                        
                        
                            SWAMP LANDS.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON offered the following resolution:

                                    the Senate not to be scared at its size, for its importance is
                                    equal to its weight.

                                    in trust for the benefit of creditors, and regulating a mode for

                                            or the construction of a new one, as recommended by the
                                            Governor.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. EDWARDS. The subject of that resolution is contained in the
                                Governor's Message. The consideration of the message has been made
                                the special order of the day for to-morrow at two o'clock, and I
                                suppose, at that time, it will be most proper for the House to
                                consider the subject of the resolution. I therefore, would move to
                                lay the resolution on the table.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I propose to meet this question especially and singly, at
                                the threshhold, in order that much time may be saved.
                            The SPEAKER. It is out of order to discuss a motion to lay on the
                                table.
                            Messrs. Murray and Davis demanded the yeas and nays, which being
                                ordered and taken,resulted - yeas 88, nays 5 - as follows:

                                            Speaker - 5.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            AUDITOR, SECRETARY AND TREASURER'S REPORTS.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House the reports of the Auditor,
                                Secretary and Treasurer of State for 1857.
                            Mr. EDWARDS. I would ask of the Chair whether it is in order to take
                                up those reports?
                            The SPEAKER. I presume, as they are already printed, the only order
                                to be taken is to require them to be distributed.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT OF THE SESSION.
                            Mr. LEWIS submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That this House, with the
                                            concurrence of the Senate, do fix on the 10th of
                                            December as the day of the final adjournment of this
                                            session of the General Assembly, or at an earlier day if
                                            the business be completed.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY proposed to amend by striking out and inserting the
                                first day of December.
                            Mr. LEWIS accepted
                            Mr. COLGROVE I have found that these resolutions generally amount to
                                nothing; and esteeming this but an indirect censure upon members,
                                and more intended for home than the dispatch of business, I move to
                                lay it on the table.
                            Mr. BOYD. I shall vote to lay the resolution on the table, because I
                                consider it an indirect impeachment of the body. It becomes us all
                                to discharge our duties here with fidelity, and I suppose every man
                                here is disposed to do his duty. That being the case, to introduce
                                such a resolution now in advance even of the announcement of our
                                committees, it is wholly premature. Therefore, whilst I am disposed
                                to speed on the business of the body, I shall vote to lay it on the
                                table.
                            Mr. LEWIS. I did not suppose I was throwing a fire brand - 
                            The SPEAKER. Debate cannot be entertained on a motion to lay on the
                                table.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY demanded the yeas and nays, and they were ordered and
                                taken, resulting - yeas 51, nays 43, as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS - Messrs. Austin, Baird, Black, Boyd, Boxley,

                                            Treadway, Waterman, Wood - 43.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MURRAY, when his name was called, said he was in favor of this
                                committe giving its action to the subjects brought before it by the
                                Governor of the State exclusively.
                            Mr. DOBBINS (interposing) submitted that if the gentleman from
                                Elkhart proceed, there was a discourtesy toward the gentleman from
                                Orange, [Mr. Lewis.]
                            The SPEAKER. The gentleman can explain if the House consent.
                                ["Consent consent," "no consent."]
                            Mr. MURRAY. I do not wish the consent of the House, where others have
                                been denied. I understand, however, that the rules give the right to
                                explain a vote.
                            
                            The SPEAKER. I shall hold that a member has no right to explain,
                                unless by unanimous consent of the House.
                            Mr. SNYDER, when his name was called said: he had paired off on
                                general questions with Mr. Stiles, absent on account of sickness in
                                his family.
                            Mr. EDWARDS said he must insist upon the rule - the rule which
                                requires every member to vote unless excused by the House. He did
                                not acknowledge the right of pairing off here as is practiced in
                                Congress. It was possible to break a quorum in that way.
                            Mr. SNYDER asked leave and was excused from voting.
                            So, the resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            MESSAGE DOCUMENTS.
                            Mr. DOBBINS submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That 500 copies of the
                                            documents accompanying the Governor's Message, be
                                            printed for the use of members.

                            Mr. AUSTIN submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the door-keeper be
                                            directed to lay on the table of each member a copy of
                                            the reports of the different departments of the State at
                                            as early a period as possible.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                             THE PENITENTIARY.
                            Mr. HAMILTON submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of five be
                                            appointed to visit, examine and particularly inquire
                                            into the situation and condition of the State
                                            Penitentiary at Jeffersonville, and report fully to this
                                            House, at an early day, at its next regular session, the
                                            propriety and expediency of extending, improving and
                                            enlarging the same, in what manner and to what extent
                                            the same can be so extended, improved and enlarged, and
                                            the probable cost and expense thereof.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BOYD. Among the twenty-one standing committees to which this
                                House is entitled, there is one on this very subject, and I see no
                                reason for changing the direction of business in this way I move to
                                modify the resolution so as to make it directory to the
                                    Standing Committee on the Affairs of the State
                                    Prison.
                            Mr. HAMILTON acquiesced in the modification.
                            The resolution was rejected.
                        
                        
                            COMMITTEE ON STATIONERY.
                            Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That there be a committee of
                                            three appointed by the Speaker of the House, to be
                                            designated as the Committee on
                                                Stationery, whose duty it shall be to
                                            direct all purchases for the House of Representatives,
                                            and their proper distribution, and to see that in every
                                            case the bill of purchase shall accompany the article
                                            purchased, and be placed on file for inspection.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            DOCUMENT POSTAGE STAMPS.
                            On motion of Mr. MERRIF1ELD, Mr. Jeffries' resolution for the
                                purchase of two dollars' worth of postage stamps for the use of each
                                member of the House of Representatives was taken up.
                            Mr. SHERMAN moved to strike out "two" and insert "one."
                            Mr. MURRAY. I am opposed to this - not that I am opposed to
                                purchasing stamps to send off documents, but I am opposed to the
                                principle of purchasing stamps to carry around in ourpockets; or put
                                into our drawers. It is a notorious fact that this is a growing
                                evil, and this Legislature, pledged, as it is, to retrenchment and
                                reform, ought to look to it in time. We have seen in the specific
                                appropriation bill such items as gold-headed canes, gold pens,
                                &c., purchased some way by the funds of the State, and it
                                becomes us to arrest these abuses. I am opposed to purchasing
                                stamps, unless they are put upon the documents and laid on our
                                tables.
                            Mr. JEFFRIES. I was unsophisticated enough to suppose that members of
                                the Legislature are honorable and honest men. I am opposed to buying
                                stamps to carry in our pockets, or to allow them to be used at
                                liberty by the attaches of the House; and if such be the use made of
                                them, I am opposed to my own resolution. But I still think members
                                and officers of this House are honest and trust worthy - and there
                                is a dilemma here,for if we cannot trust ourselves, how can we trust
                                others whom we employ?
                            Mr DAVIDSON - possessing already a good cane - moved to insert
                                "three" (dollar's worth.)
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY moved that the resolution and amendments be referred to
                                the committee on stationery.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I disclaim any intention of making any reference whatever
                                to the honesty of members on this floor. I shall vote in favor of
                                referring this subject, and I hope the committee will take it under
                                advisement, so that we shall be furnished with our documents ready
                                stamped. Former Legislatures have been in the habit of procuring
                                documents and then sending for stamps; and as the remains of this
                                practice their documents remain in heaps to this day, piled away and
                                useless in this State-house. I am not in favor of furnishing stamps
                                out of our own funds, but I wish to nip this particular abuse right
                                in the bud.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. Mr. Speaker, I was a member of the last House of
                                Representatives, and I find nothing in the record justifying the
                                allusion that anything of the kind referred to ever took place in
                                that House; but it seems that for the Senate,gold-headed canes,gold
                                pens and things of that sort were furnished, and we have no right to
                                refer to that branch. I am here, sir, not for the purpose of making
                                loud professions of economy, but to act, I trust, economically. I am
                                not afraid to vote against stamps for sending out documents. I know
                                the people would not condemn that. I might also be willing to pay
                                this expense out of my own pocket, though as much in need of money
                                as any gentlemen. But I rose here to repress the unfounded
                                imputation, as it might be understood, against the last House of
                                Representatives.
                            The subject was referred to the Committee on
                                    Stationery.
                            The SPEAKER thereupon announced his appointment of Messrs. Branham,
                                Hunter and Turpie, to constitute said committee on stationery.
                        
                        
                            THE SINKING FUND.
                            Mr. WATERMAN submitted a resolution requiring the appointment of a
                                select committee on the Sinking Fund, to inquire into the condition
                                of said fund, and report whether any legislation is necessary at this session for the
                                security of said fund.
                            The SPEAKER suggested, and Mr. Waterman acquiesced, in making the
                                report directory to the standing committee on the Sinking Fund.
                            Mr. MAJOR suggested that there was an impropriety in offering thus
                                prematurely, resolutions on business of importance that must come
                                bofore the standing committees.
                            The resolution was rejected.
                            The House then took a recess until 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, as I understand itis desirable on the part
                                of the Chair to have some time to devote to the organization of the
                                standing committees, and believing that we can do nothing that is
                                legitimate before the time when the committees shall be organized, I
                                move that we adjourn till to-morrow morning, nine o'clock.
                            Mr. DAVIS. The member from Boone has a proposition.
                            Mr. EDWARDS. I withdraw the motion.

                            
                                 BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.
                                Mr. DUVAL submitted the following, which was adopted:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            A joint resolution in relation to the subject of
                                                legislationat the present session of the General
                                                Assembly of the State of Indiana.
                                            WHEREAS, by the Constitution biennial sessions of the
                                                Legislature are deemed to be sufficient for the
                                                ordinary legislation of the State, and a special
                                                session can only be justified in cases where
                                                legislation is so urgent that it can not be delayed
                                                until the regular session:
                                            AND WHEREAS, The only matter brought before this body
                                                by Executive communication, upon which the public
                                                welfare requires immediate action, is an act of the
                                                General Assembly, making provision for raising money
                                                to pay the coming instalment of interest on the
                                                State debt, and to carry on the State Government:
                                                Therefore be it
                                            Resolved by the General Assembly of the
                                                  State of Indiana, That no other legislation
                                                or business requiring the action of both Houses be
                                                done at this session than to make provision for
                                                raising money for the purposes aforesaid, and the
                                                revaluation of property for taxation.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. EDWARDS now renewed his motion.
                                And the House adjourned till to-morrow morning at nine
                                    o'clock.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            WEDNESDAY, November 24, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read, pending which,
                        Mr. MURRAY suggested that the reading of the standing committees proposed
                            by Mr. Cravens be passed over.
                        Mr, WILLIAMS objected, and the names were read through by the
                            Secretary.
                        Mr. CARNAHAN desired to be recorded as voting for the resolution
                            introduced yesterday by the Senator from Laporte, with reference to the
                            Wabash and Erie Canal.
                        The Senate consented.
                        
                            MESSAGE DOCUMENTS.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That there be printed for the
                                            use of the Senate five hundred copies of each of the
                                            documents accompanying the Governor's Message.
                                    
                                
                            
                            I refer particularly to the report of the Trustees of the
                                Penitentiary, with regard to the number of convicts, &c.
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            SENATE EMPLOYEES TO BE SWORN.
                            Mr. STEVENS. I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That we require an oath to be
                                            administered to every appointee made by the Door-keeper
                                            or his assistants; also, the appointees of the Principal
                                            and Assistant Secretary, that they will faithfully
                                            perform their duties, and watch over and protect all
                                            property belonging to the State, the State House, or to
                                            members of this body.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            STATE OFFICERS' REPORTS.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                            directed to lay on the table of Senators, copies of each
                                            of the reports from the different departments and
                                            officer of State for 1857, as soon as practicable, If
                                            the same are now printed.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY PRISONS.
                            Mr. HEFFREN introduced a bill (No.
                                    11) in relation to the ventilating and warming of county
                                prisons, which was read through by the Secretary and passed to the
                                second reading.
                        
                        
                            UNSAFE PAPER CURRENCY.
                            Mr. TARK1NGTON introduced a bill (No. 12) to prohibit unsafe paper
                                currency and to punish the making and circulating of the same which
                                was read through by the Secretary and passed to the second
                                reading.
                        
                        
                            ELECTIONS.
                            Mr. HILL introduced a bill (No. 13) entitled An Act to amend Senate
                                bill No. 13, with regard to elections, which was read through by the
                                Secretary and passed to the second reading.
                        
                        
                            MISDEMEANORS.
                            Mr. GREEN introduced a bill (No. 14) entitled An Act to amend the 22d
                                section of an act defining misdemeanors and prescribing punishments
                                therefor, approved June 14,1852, which was read through by the
                                Secretary and passed to the second reading.
                        
                        
                            NEW COUNTIES AND COUNTY LINES.
                            Mr. WEIR'S bill (No. 14) repealing an act authorizing the formation
                                of new counties and changing county boundaries was now read through
                                the second time by the Secretaiy and passed to a third reading.
                            Mr. RICE I move the postponement of the consideration of this bill
                                for one week from today, or until the standing committees are
                                organized, or I will move its reference to a select committee of
                                three.
                            The PRESIDNT. I would suggest that, suppose this bill should be
                                referred to the Judiciary Committee, or any other
                                standing committee of the Senate, it goes upon the file and when
                                that committee is formed it goes to the committee. I suppose it
                                would be in order to refer the bill to the Judiciary
                                    Committee, although the committee is not formed.
                            Mr. RICE. I move to lay the bill upon the table.
                            The motion was withdrawn for
                            Mr. WEIR. This act was introduced to repeal

                        Vol. I.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, NOV. 30, 1858.
                        No. 4.
                    
                    
                        
                            an act of 1857, with the express purposes applying to a case in point
                                now pending in the Supreme Court, and that is the object of passing
                                the bill with the emergency clause.
                            Mr. RICE. I now renew my motion to lay on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            LAW OF DIVORCE.
                            Mr. WALLACE'S bill (No. 4) for the amendment of the divorce act, was
                                read through the second time by the Secretary, and passed to a third
                                reading.
                            Mr. GOODING. I move that the bill be committed to a select committee
                                of three or five. But as the author of the bill is absent, I suppose
                                it will be better to lay it on the table. I make that motion.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                            Mr. WALLACE. I move to take it up from the table, and refer it to a
                                select committee of three.
                            Mr. CONNER. I move to amend by inserting "five."
                            The Senate consented, and authorized the Chair to appoint.
                            The PRESIDENT appointed Messrs. Wallace, March, Gooding, Conner and
                                Murray as said committee.
                            Mr. MILLER'S bill [No. 5]
                                providing for the collection of taxes upon lands in the corporations
                                and towns in which the land lies, was read through the second time
                                by the Secretary, and passed to the third reading.
                            Mr. MILLER. I move that the bill be referred to a select committee of
                                three.
                            The Senate consented, and authorized the Chair to appoint Messrs.
                                Miller, O'Brien, Connelly, Bennett and McClure said committee.
                        
                        
                            RE APPRAISEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Mr. President I move to take up bill No. 1, having
                                reference to the appraisement of real estate, from the table.
                            The Senate consented.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I now move to refer it to a committee of one from each
                                Congressional District.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I would suggest that it be referred to a committee of the
                                whole House first.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I would rather have it referred to a committee of one
                                from each Congressional District first. It is intended to refer the
                                other bill upon this subject to the same committee.
                            Mr. GREEN. I am satisfied this is one of the most important bills of
                                the session, and I am in favor of hurrying it through.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I insist upon referring it to a Committee of the
                                Whole.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I would prefer that both bills be referred to the
                                same committee.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I will withdraw my motion, so as to dispose of them both
                                at the same time.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I will move that it be referred to a Committee of the
                                Whole House, and that it be made the special order for next Monday
                                at two o'clock.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            DEEDS.
                            Mr. GREEN'S bill (No. 6) for
                                the correction of detects in the execution of deeds, was read,
                                through the second time by the Secretary and passed to the third
                                reading.
                            Mr MARCH. I move to lay the bill upon the table.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            CHANGE OF VENUE.
                            Mr. HEFFREN'S bill (No. 7) to authorize and provide a mode of
                                changing the venue in certain cases not provided for by law, and
                                providing for the trial of the same, was read through the second
                                time by the Secretary and passed to the third reading.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I move to lay the bill on the table, for the purpose of
                                referring it to the Judiciary Committee at the
                                proper time.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            SALE OF SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS.
                            Mr. HILL'S bill (No. 8) regulating and restricting the sale of
                                spirituous and intoxicating liquors, was read through the second
                                time by the Secretary and passed to the third reading.
                            Mr. HILL. I move that the bill be laid upon the table and three
                                hundred copies be printed.
                            Mr. JOHNSON. I move that only fifty copies be printed.
                            Mr. MURRAY. The bill is of a good deal of interest to the people of
                                the State, and I believe it will meet with approbation. I want to
                                send home some copies of this bill, and I am in favor of printing
                                two hundred copies at least.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. For the purpose of setting matters right, I will state
                                that the Printer gets as much for printing one copy as he does for
                                an hundred. The State furnishes the paper, and that is all the extra
                                expense. It is a very small affair.
                            Mr. CONNER. I am opposed, as a general rule, to the printing of any
                                bill until it goes through the ordeal of a committee. I believe it
                                is contrary to good policy.
                            Mr. McCLURE. I am in favor of printing. This is a good bill, and I
                                want to send a large number home to my constituency to be informed
                                whether this is the kind they want or not.
                            Mr. JOHNSON. I withdraw my amendment and move a division of the
                                question. I want to lay it on the table and refer it to the
                                    Temperance Committee.
                            
                            Mr. RICE. I am in favor of laying upon the table and printing, then
                                bringing it before a committee of the whole, and then referring it
                                to the Temperance Committee.
                            Mr. WALLACE. I second the motion.
                            Motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            MARRIED WOMEN.
                            Mr. BOBBS' bill (No. 9) providing for and securing the rights of
                                married women in real property, was read through the second time by
                                the Secretary, and passed to the third reading.
                            Mr. BOBBS I move to refer this bill to the Judiciary
                                    Committee.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            ORDER OF BUSINESS.
                            The PRESIDENT now directed the reading of the resolution introduced
                                by the Senator from Montgomery, on Monday last, in the following
                                words:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the interests of the
                                            people demand that this Legislature, without delay
                                            proceed to the passage of acts for the raising of
                                            revenue for State purposes, for the re-appraisement of
                                            real estate; and that the election of officers, the
                                            discussion of political questions, and contested
                                            election cases shall be postponed to the regular session
                                            and that when such acts are matured and passed, this
                                            session do adjourn.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. ANTHONY. I move to amend as fol lows: Strike out all after the
                                word "resolved" and insert,
                            "That the interests of the people demand that this Legislature,
                                without unnecessary delay, proceeed to the passage of acts to raise
                                revenue for State purposes, to reappraise real estate, for the
                                necessary general and special appropriations and such other acts as
                                are material to a just regard of the public good and to maintain the
                                rights and dignity of the State, and that when such acts are passed
                                this session will adjourn."
                            The amendment was agreed to by consent.
                            Mr. WALLACE. I was not present when the motion was adopted, or I
                                should have made a motion in reference to it.
                            Mr ANTHONY sustained the resolution, as amended, in a few
                                remarks.
                            Mr. STEELE submitted humorous remarks on party politics, objecting to
                                party names, &c.
                            Mr. WALLACE. I understand, and wish to ask the Senate whether the
                                report is correct that the Republican caucus last night passed a
                                resolution in reference to the election of United States Senators
                                to-day?
                            Mr. STEELE. I will answer the question by asking the Senator if he
                                believes we have two legal and constitutional Senators in the United
                                States Senate? [Laughter.]
                            Mr. WALLACE. I will make a fair agreement with the Senator. If he
                                will answer my question, I will answer his. That is fair. What says
                                the Senator?
                            Mr. STEELE. I will do it if he says we havo two legal United States
                                Senators in Congress whe represent the wishes of Indiana.
                            Mr. WALLACE I will name another proposition. I will answer first, if
                                the gentleman will pledge his honor as a Senator, if I answer his
                                question, he will answer mine.
                            Mr. STEELE. I want to make a prediction. I venture the prediction
                                that the Senator will belong to the powers that be before the
                                session is over.
                            Mr. WALLACE. I put it to the Senator whether there is any thing in
                                this that requires me to answer. But I do not shirk anything. I
                                think I have shown to what party I belong. I have no hesitation in
                                saying here, sir, that I am a Democrat.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I am informed that the Republicans did agree to elect
                                Henry S. Lane as one of the United States Senators.
                            Mr. ANTHONY. I did not attend that caucus. I have had that amendment
                                in my pocket since day before yesterday, written just as it is now.
                                That amendment is not offered in view of anything which took place
                                last night.
                            Mr. JOHNSON. I believe that amendment was adopted by consent. If it
                                would be in order, I move a reconsideration of that vote.
                            The yeas and nays were demanded.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I move a call of the Senate.
                            A motion was made that the Senate adjourn.The yeas and nays were
                                demanded, and being ordered and taken thereon, resulted - yeas 8,
                                nays 41.
                            So the Senate refused to adjourn.
                        
                        
                            STATIONERY.
                            Mr. GREEN, from the Special Committee on Stationery, submitted the
                                following report:
                            The committee to whom was referred the resolution, and the amendments
                                thereto, relative to the officers of the Senate furnishing "articles
                                to be used by the Senate," have had the same under consideration,
                                and have directed me to report the following, as the result of their
                                deliberations, and recommend the adoption of the same:
                            First. That all officers of the Senate, their
                                assistants and employees, unless specially authorized by the
                                Senate,, be prohibited from contracting any accounts for articles to
                                be used by the Senate. Put for everything required for the official
                                use of the Senators, they shall apply to the Secretary of the
                                Senate, who shall make purchases only when the articles required can
                                not be obtained from the Secretary of State, application being made
                                to him therefor.
                            Second. That the Secretary of the Senate shall be
                                charged by the Secretary of State, with all stationery or other
                                articles furnished for the use of the Senate. That the Secretary of
                                the Senate shall charge to each member or officer of the Senate, all
                                stationery or other articles furnished them, and render a weekly
                                account of the same to the Finance Committee,
                                with itemized bills of all purchases made. And the Secretary of
                                State be requested to report weekly to the Senate, the amount of
                                articles furnished to the Secretary of the Senate.
                            Third. That the Senate will audit no account for
                                purchases not made personally by the Secretary or upon his written
                                order, and no account for services rendered by any officer,
                                assistant or employee, not specially authorized by the Senate.
                            Fourth. That the Secretary of the Senate, and
                                Doorkeeper, immediately inform the Senate the number of assistants
                                and employees required by each at this time.
                            Fifth. That the compensation of Door-keeper and
                                Assistants, shall not exceed three dollars per day each, as now
                                prescribed by law.
                            Mr. SLACK. I move to lay the report on the table.
                            The PRESIDENT. At the time the report was received I was not disposed
                                to decide it out of order, but as I see there is not a disposition
                                readily to concur, I shall hold that the report is out of order,
                                there being demanded a call of the Senate.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I withdraw the demand.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I desire to elect United States Senators, but I wish
                                legislation to be proceeded with first. The Senator spoke of several
                                items of legislation which were necessary and urgently demanded at
                                the hands of this General Assembly, particularly a bill introduced by the Senator from
                                Montgomery, at the last session, for the re-organization of
                                townships, and expressed his willingness to aid in the passage
                                thereof.
                            Mr. WALLACE. To test the sincerity of the Senator, I move to pass
                                over the matter pending, informally, that I may introduce the bill
                                which I hold in my hand, which obtained a second reading at the last
                                session, and is the identical bil the Senator from Howard alludes
                                to.
                            The Senate refused.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON now insisted on his motion for the reconsideration of
                                the vote by which the amendment of the Senator from Floyd was
                                adopted.
                            The yeas and nays being ordered, and being taken on this question,
                                resulted - yeas 23, nays 26 - as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS - Messrs. Carnahan, Cobb, Connelly, Fisk, Hamilton,
                                            Hargrove, Heffren,Jennings, Johnson, Line, Lomax,
                                            McClure, McLeau, Miller, O'Brien, Odell, Shoemaker,
                                            Slack, Studabaker, Tarkington, Wallace, Williams and
                                            Wilson - 23.
                                        NAYS - Messrs. Anthony, Beeson,Bennett, Blair, Bobbs,
                                            Brown, Conner, Cooper, Cravens of Jefferson, Cravens of
                                            Madison, Culver, Green, Hendry, Hill, Kinley, March,
                                            Murray, Rice, Robinson, Steele, Stevens, Thompson,
                                            Turner, Wagner and Wier - 26.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The question recurring upon the resolution as amended - 
                            Mr. SLACK. I move to lay the resolution on the table.
                            The motion was withdrawn for
                            Mr. JONES. I understand that when I took the oath to support the
                                Constitution of the United States and of the State of Indiana, that
                                I was bound to discharge my duty, as I understood it, and no
                                resolution can bind my action No man can define the duties of
                                members of this body. I regard the question as worthless, and think
                                the whole subject should be dismissed.
                            Mr. SLACK. I now renew my motion to lay on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to, and then
                            The Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The PRESIDENT resumed the chair at 2 o'clock, and directed the
                                Secretary to read the report submitted this morning by the chairman
                                of the special committee on stationery.

                            
                                STATIONERY.
                                Mr. GOODING. I move to lay the report on the table.
                                The motion was lost.
                                Mr. WALLACE. I move the adoption of the report.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr. MURRAY. In that report there are more cats in the meal tub
                                    than many of you know of.
                                Mr. WALLACE. I move the reconsideration of the vote just taken,
                                    for the purpose of getting at the cats in the meal-tub.
                                The motion was not agreed to.
                            
                            
                                SETTEES.
                                Mr. MURRAY. I offer the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper of
                                                the Senate be requested to furnish two settees, to
                                                be placed on either side of the President's

                                The resolution was adopted by consent.

                                Mr. CONNER. I offer the following resolution:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the pretended
                                                election of Jesse D. Bright and Graham N. Fitch, to

                                                members of the General Assembly of the State of
                                                Indiana, during the session of 1857, was illegal,
                                                unconstitutional and void, and that the State of
                                                Indiana is not at this time legally or
                                                constitutionally represented in the Senate of the

                                The yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken,
                                    resulted - yeas 24, nays 26 - as follows:

                                                26.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, said: I shall not on this
                                    occasion give my views with regard to the constitutionality of
                                    that election. My vote will be governed by this consideration: I
                                    see no good that can now result upon any action of this body at
                                    this time.So the resolution was not laid on the table.
                                Mr. WILLIAMS. I move to amend by striking out all after the word
                                    "resolved," and insert: "That inasmuch as Jesse D. Bright and
                                    Graham N. Fitch have been confirmed in their seats by the Senate
                                    of the United States, it is inexpedient to entertain any motion
                                    for the election of United States Senators at this session.
                                Mr. MURRAY. It is not in order.
                                The PRESIDENT. If I were to decide upon the point of order, I
                                    would decide that the original resolution is not in order - but
                                    I will decide that this is in order.
                                Mr. MURRAY. I appeal from the decision of the Chair.
                                The PRESIDENT. State your appeal in writing.
                                Mr. MURRAY wrote: "The resolution of the Senator from Wabash
                                    being under consideration, the Senator from Knox offers an
                                    amendment, to which objection is made by the Senator from Howard
                                    because not being germain to the original resolution, and the
                                    objection overruled by the Chair - I appeal to the Senate from
                                    this ruling."
                                Mr. HEFFREN. I move to lay the appeal on the table.
                                The yeas and nays were demanded.
                                Mr. WALLACE. I want to say, (by the consent of the Senate) that
                                    this matter is going to be settled in a certain way, and I hold
                                    it to be our duty, knowing it is to be settled, not to throw
                                    anything in the way.
                                The yeas and nays being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 22,

                                Mr. WALLACE, when his name was called, said we had a test vote
                                    upon this question upon the vote to lay upon the table, and it
                                    was decided against us. It is now manifest that the party
                                    proposing this resolution have the power to carry it. Knowing
                                    this to be the fact, and in order tosave time - I vote No.
                                So the Senate refused to sustain the appeal, and the question
                                    recurred: Shall the decision of the Chair remain as the judgment
                                    of the Senate?
                                The PRESIDENT. I will state why the amendment is in order. The
                                    objection made by the Senator from Howard was, that the
                                    amendment was not germain. I admit that to be true; nor is it
                                    necessary that it should be. When a resolution is introduced
                                    upon any subject, a Senator has the right to move to strike out
                                    and insert matter upon any other subject.
                                The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken on the
                                    question of appeal, resulted - yeas 24, nays 26 - as
                                    follows:

                                So the Senate refused to sustain the Chair.
                                Mr. TARKINGTON. I propose to amend, by striking out all after the
                                    word "resolved," and inserting:
                                "That the election of all officers shall he postponed until the
                                    regular session of the Legislature."
                                A SENATOR moved to lay this on the table; and the yeas and nays
                                    being demanded, ordered and taken thereon, resulted - yeas 26,

                                Mr. TARKINGTON. I rose to a point of order. I think the
                                    resolution and amendment lie upon the table by this vote.
                                The PRESIDENT. To save time, I decide that the resolution does
                                    not go to the table.
                                Mr. MURRAY. I move the previous question on the adoption of the
                                    resolution, and there was a second.
                                The yeas and nays were demanded by the Senators from Howard and

                                Mr. GOODING. I do not ask the Senate to excuse me. I decline to
                                    vote, and let it so be entered upon the journal.
                                Mr. WILSON, when his name was called, also declined to vote.
                                So the resolution was adopted.
                                The PRESIDENT. Will the Senate direct the manner this vote is to
                                    be sent to Washington, so that these men may be turned out?
                                Mr. MURRAY. I would suggest that will take care of that.

                                Mr. McCLURE. I ask the Senate a a particular favor to suspend the
                                    rules and let the bill be read a second time.
                                The Senate consented, the bill was read second time by its title,
                                    and passed to the third reading.

                                 THANKSGIVING DAY.
                                Mr. MURRAY. I have a resolution to offer. It's as follows:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            WHEREAS, the Governor having by proclamation
                                                designated to-morrow as a day of thanksgiving and
                                                prayer therefore:
                                            Resolved, That when the Senate
                                                adjourns to-day, the Senate stand adjourned till
                                                Friday next.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. GOODING. I move that the resolution sit upon the table. I
                                    came here to work, and I' think the Governor will not
                                    object.
                                The yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken
                                    resulted - yeas 20, nays 30.
                                So the Senate refused to lay the resolurion upon the table.
                                Mr. MURRAY. I will withdraw the resolution if the Senate
                                    consent.
                                The Senate refused to allow the resolution to be withdrawn:
                                And then the resolution was adopted.

                                             AND WHEREAS, The course pursued by the aforesaid'
                                                Senators during the contest that arose upon the
                                                question of admitting Kansas into the Union under
                                                the Lecompton Constitution, was not consistent with
                                                the position occupied, by them before that question
                                                arose, nor in accordance with the wishes of the

                                            AND WHEREAS, Now that the Lecompton Constitution has
                                                been voted down by the people of Kansas, the only
                                                practical questions, pertinent to that Territory,
                                                that can arise
                                                to disturb the peace of the Union, are as to whether
                                                Kansas shall be admitted as a State at any time
                                                admission is demanded by her people, and whether the

                                                particular rights of the people of that Territory
                                                shall be left to the people themselves or to
                                                Congress. Therefore
                                            Be it resolved by the General Assembly
                                                  of the State of Indiana, That our Senators in
                                                Congress are hereby instructed, and our
                                                Representatives requested, to vote and use their
                                                influence for the admission of Kansas into the Union
                                                as a State, whenever the people thereof demand it;
                                                and that, to remove all obstruction from the way of
                                                such admission, the said Senators and
                                                Representatives vote, if necessary, to repeal that
                                                part of the Act passed at the last session of
                                                Congress, called the "English Bill," which requires
                                                said Territory to have a population equal to the

                                                before her people can hold another convention to
                                                form another Constitution preparatory to an
                                                application for admission as a State.
                                            Be it further resolved, That we
                                                recognize, and insist upon, the right of the people
                                                of any Territory to form and regulate their domestic
                                                institutions in their own way, subject only to the
                                                general Constitution, and that as incidental to that
                                                great right, we also recognize and insist upon their
                                                further right, through their Legislature, to pass
                                                and establish such laws and regulations relative to
                                                their property as they shall deem proper, without
                                                interference by Congress.

                                MILLER AND SHRYOCK CONTESTED CASE.
                                Mr. BENNETT introduced a preamble to this effect:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            WHEREAS, It should be the first duty of the Senate to
                                                determine who is entitled to seats therein, and the
                                                case of Kline G. Shryock against Hugh Miller is
                                                still undisposed of; AND WHEREAS said contestor and
                                                contestee are entitled to a per
                                                  diem until the case is disposed of, justice
                                                to the people of the State requires an immediate
                                                decision of the case: Therefore,
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                                authorized to furnish the majority and minority
                                                reports in this case, together with the evidence
                                                accompanying the same, and that it be made the
                                                special order for next Saturday, at 10 o'clock.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. HEFFREN. I move a division of the question.
                                Mr. WALLACE. I move that the resolution be laid upon the table. I
                                    don't think the preamble states facts. I do not understand that
                                    they are both entitled to a per diem, although
                                    I grant the contestor and contestee generally gets itbut it is
                                    subject to the order of the Senate.
                                The motion prevailed, and the preamble and resolution were laid
                                    on the table.
                            
                            
                                CLOSED DOORS.
                                Mr. RICE. I offer the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                                requested to keep the front door or entrance closed
                                                against all persons during session hours except
                                                Messengers from the Governor and House of
                                                Representatives.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Objection being made by a number of Senators, the resolution was
                                    withdrawn.
                                Mr. WAGNER. I offer the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                                directed to lay upon the desk of each member of the
                                                Senate a copy of the last Report of the State Board
                                                of Agriculture.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The resolution was adopted.
                                Mr. McLEAN. I offer the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the
                                                  Judiciary Committee be
                                                requested to report upon the constitutionality of
                                                the exemption from taxation of private school and
                                                college property where the same is used for these
                                                purposes exclusively.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The resolution was adopted by consent.
                                The Senate adjourned till Friday morning, nine o'clock.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        WEDNESDAY, November 24,1858.
                        The Journal of yesterday having been read and authenticated - 
                        A Senate message announced, that that body reciprocated the resolution
                            for a committee to frame joint rules.
                        
                            STATE DEBT.
                            Mr. LAWHEAD asked and obtained unanimous consent to introduce a bill
                                (No. 1) to provide for the payment of the January instalment of
                                interest on the State debt, which was read and passed to the second
                                reading to-morrow.
                        
                        
                            REVENUE FOR 1858.
                            Mr. BOYD, (by unanimous consent,) intro duced a bill (No. 2) to raise
                                revenue for State purposes, for the year 1858; which was read
                                through and passed to the second reading tomorrow.
                        
                        
                            RE-APPRAISEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.
                            Mr. DOBBINS (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill (No. 3) to
                                provide for the appraisement of real estate in the State of Indiana,
                                and to make such appraisement uniform throughout the State; which
                                was read through and passed to a second reading.
                            Mr. BOYD. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules, in order that the
                                bill may be passed to the second reading now, and so become subject
                                to an order to print. The bill is very lengthy, and having but one
                                copy it will be impossible for every member to examine it. We wish
                                to suspend the rule requiring bills to be read on separate days,
                                have it read the second time by its title, and then to move to lay
                                it on the table and order it to be printed, that all may have an
                                opportunity of examining it.
                            The SPEAKER, (Mr. Edwards in the Chair.) The rule requires that a
                                resolution to suspend the rules shall be taken by yeas and nays.
                            And the yeas and nays being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 81,
                                nays 14.
                            So, the rules being suspended, the bill was again read by its
                                title.
                            Mr, BOYD. I move that the bill be laid on the table, and that 100
                                copies be printed for the use of the House of Representatives.
                            Mr. MURRAY. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to printing this bill, and all
                                bills until they shall come
                                before this body recommended from a reg ular committee. I do this
                                upon a principle of economy. It will cost some $20 or $25 to print
                                this bill, and then, in all probability it wil have to be referred,
                                and the committee may amend or lay it over altogether and substitute
                                some other. Such a practice will run up the expenses of our
                                Legislature enormously. For my self,I hope that some bill for this
                                important object will be got up, not so long as this - something
                                that the officers will be able to understand.
                            Mr. COLGROVE. I move to refer the bill to the Committee on
                                    Ways and Means.
                            The SPEAKER. That motion is out of order.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. The gentleman from Elkhart has taken up nearly half the
                                time of the session in talking about economy; and I have found that
                                these gentlemen talkers about economy are generally opposed to
                                practicing it. A number of us around here wish to get forward these
                                bills for re-appraisement of real estate, and for revenue; these
                                main objects of the sessionand they do not wish to talk much about
                                extraneous matters. When gentlemen oppose the printing of 100 copies
                                of a bill of such importance as this, it seems to me like economy on
                                the back track. How can the gentleman know the provisions of the
                                bill from the reading of the Clerk? But if he had a copy before him
                                he could see whether it contained all that is necessary. Economy
                                certainly would teach any gentleman that a copy of this bill should
                                be placed before each member, for his careful perusal.
                            I will say, once for all, that no vote of mine shall ever aid in the
                                extravagant appropriation of money on this floor; but I will always
                                vote for the printing of every important proposition here, that I
                                may be well informed as to how I ought to vote upon it. As I stated
                                yesterday, I am not here to make loud professions of economy, but to
                                act in an economical manner; and I make not this profession that it
                                may go to the country, but I mean to show my economy in action. I
                                apprehend that there is not a man in the State but expects every
                                member on this floor to peruse carefully every important proposition
                                before he votes on it. I do not speak of this bill as an important
                                measure because I introduced it, for I have copied the most of it
                                from the conclusions of abler men, but from the fact that it lays
                                down a basis upon which the taxes shall be assessed for five years
                                to come. Opposition to printing such a bill, indicates to my mind a
                                wish not to understand it. I want to read the bill again for
                                myself.
                            Mr. COLGROVE, without any desire to be thought wanting in courtesy to
                                the gentleman from Martin, insisted that no bill, whether important
                                or not, should be printed before it has passed through the hands of
                                a committee. It w s asking too much; and the gentleman must not take
                                it unkind if he said this bill was entirely too voluminous. Half the
                                matter might make a bill equally as good and as easily understood by
                                the officers and people. If that went to a committee it would, no
                                doubt, be cut down materially, and otherwise changed. Why then print

                                serving on the committee on Roads. He was opposed
                                to all roads.
                            The House took a recess till 2 o'clock, P M.

                                MESSAGE.
                                The SPEAKER announced the special order for the consideration of
                                    the recommendations in the Governor's message in Committee of
                                    the Whole: and accordingly - 
                                The House resolved into Committee of the Whole - Mr. Edwards in
                                    the chair - and the Governor's message was again read by the
                                    clerk, until the further reading was dispensed with.
                                Mr. FORDYCE submitted a resolution, to refer so much of the
                                    message as relates to benevolent institutions of the State to
                                    the Committee on that subject.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON submitted a resolution to the effect,That that
                                    portion of the Governor's message which relates to the increase
                                    of crime in the State, and the insufficiency of the penitentiary
                                    in point of capacity to contain the increased number of convicts
                                    which his Excellency predicts will be sent thither by the 1st of
                                    January, 1859, and the necessity arising thereupon for the
                                    enlargement of the old, or the erection of a new penitentiary,
                                    be referred to the Committee on the State
                                        Prison, and that said committee be instructed to
                                    inquire into the cause of such alarming increase of crime, and
                                    report the result of such inquiry to the House at as early a day
                                    as practicable.
                                Mr. DOBBINS submitted a resolution, to refer so much of the
                                    message as relates to the re-appraisement of real estate in the
                                    State of Indiana, to the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means.
                                Mr. BOYD submitted a resolution, to refer so much of the message
                                    as relates to the tax levy for the year 1858 to the
                                        Committee on Ways and Means.
                                These resolutions were severally agreed to.
                                On motion by Mr. TURPIE, the committee then arose, and the
                                    Chairman reported these resolutions to the House, recommending
                                    their adoption, and asking leave to be discharged from the
                                    further consideration of the subject.
                                On motion by Mr. MURRAY, the report of the Commitee of the Whole
                                    was concurred in, and so these several resolutions were
                                    adopted.
                            
                            
                                STATIONERY, &C.
                                Mr. HUNTER, from the Special Committee on
                                        Stationery, reported that they had made the  necessary arrangements for
                                    stationery, &c., for the session; and for the prevention of
                                    abuse in these things they recommend the following
                                    regulations:
                                
                                    That the clerk of the Stationery Room make all his
                                        purchases on account of the General Assembly of the
                                        Secretary of State.
                                    That the clerk of the Stationery Room open an
                                        account with each member, and charge him with all articles
                                        furnished to him.
                                    That the clerk of the Stationery Room shall not
                                        permit any person not a member of the House of
                                        representatives to receive stationery therefrom.
                                    That there may be a check upon the said clerk of the
                                        Stationery Room, it is respectfully requested that each
                                        member keep an account of all articles so delivered to
                                        him.
                                
                                The report was concurred in and adopted as an order of the
                                    House.
                            
                            
                                STAMPS.
                                Mr. HUNTER, from the same committee to whom was referred the
                                    subject of purchasing stamps for document postage of members of
                                    the House of Representatives, reported adversely to the
                                    proposition.
                                The House refused to concur in the report.
                                Mr. THOMPSON, of Elkhart, submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                                authorized to purchase $20 worth of one cent postage
                                                stamps, which are to be retained in his possession
                                                and placed upon such papers or documents as may be
                                                handed to him for such purpose by members of this
                                                House.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren. I move to strike out "Door-keeper," and
                                    insert Clerk of the stationery room."
                                Mr. THOMPSON accepted this modification.
                                Mr. COLGROVE. I am opposed to the adoption of that resolution. It
                                    is indifferent with me whether we purchase stamps or not; but if
                                    we are to purchase, I want it in a direct regular way. This
                                    resolution, I think, is a direct insult upon the members of this
                                    House. [Consent; consent.] It presupposes that we wish to steal,
                                    to use plain language. If it is neccessary to purchase stamps
                                    for members of this House, in order to free them from the
                                    expense of sending documents home to their constituents, I am
                                    for purchasing a reasonable amount and placing them at once into
                                    the hands of each member. I expect to see members on this floor
                                    who are "straining at gnats" now, ready to "swallow the camel"
                                    before they leave their places.
                                Mr. WHITEMAN. I move to lay the resolution on the table.
                                Mr. REEFER demanded the yeas and nays, which being ordered and
                                    taken, resulted - yeas 92, nays 4.
                                So the resolution was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                COMMITTEE ON CORPORATIONS.
                                The SPEAKER appointed Mr. Baird, of Vigo, to the Chairmanship of
                                    the Committee on Corporations, declined by
                                    Mr. Davis, and added Mr. Hartley of Ripley to the same
                                    Committee.
                            
                            
                                STAMPS.
                                Mr. KEEPER submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That tho Doorkeeper furnish
                                            each member with $3,00 worth of postage stamps.
                                    
                                
                                Mr. RITTER and Mr. THOMPSON of Elkhart demanded the yeas and nays
                                    on its adoption,which being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas
                                    47, nays 49:
                                So the resolution was rejected.
                            
                            
                                UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                                Mr. AUSTIN submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the pretended
                                                election of Jesse D. Brigt and Graham N. Fitch to
                                                the Senate of the United States by a portion of the
                                                members of the General Assembly of the State, during
                                                the session of 1857, was illegal, unconstitutional
                                                and void, and that the State of Indiana is not at
                                                this time legally and constitutionally rep esented

                            The PRESIDENT. The next thing in order is the following
                                resolution:
                            The Secretary read the resolution offered Mr. Tarkington on the first
                                day of the session:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the rules for the
                                            government of the Senate of 1855, be adopted as the
                                            rules for the government of the present session of the
                                            Senate.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. CONNER moved to amend by striking  out the figures "1855," and inserting
                                "1857,' and proposing a number of alterations and additions which
                                were read through by the Secretary.
                            Mr. CONNER. It was my intention to offer reasons for the adoption of
                                these amendments but I find myself so hoarse that I must leave it to
                                other Senators.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I call for a division of the question.
                            Mr. JONES. I hope this subject will be deferred until new Senators
                                will have an opportunity to examine the rules.
                            Mr. GREEN proceeded to make some remarks in support of the
                                amendments, and was interrupted by
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I rise to a point of order. A division of the
                                question being demanded, the question is upon the first rule
                                proposed to be amended.
                            The PRESIDENT. The first question will be to strike out "1855" and
                                insert "1857,"
                            Mr. WILLIAMS. If in order I will move to refer the whole matter to a
                                select committee of one from each Congressional District.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I second the motion.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I should like to accommodate the Senator from Knox,
                                but it will not save time. These amendments will hive to be
                                discussed here and we may as well do it now.
                            Mr. MARCH. I believe we may just as well come to a vote now. I move
                                to lay the motion for reference on the table.
                            The yeas and nays were demanded by Messrs. Williams and Heffren, and
                                being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 26, nays 23.
                            So the motion to refer was laid on the table.
                            The question then being upon striking out "1855" and inserting "1857"
                                - 
                            The amendment was agreed to.
                            Then followed quite an animated debate upon the further amendments,
                                but more particularly upon the merits and demerits of the Miller and
                                Shryock contested election case, in which Messrs. Heffren, Cravens,
                                Tarkmgton, Murray and Wallace, took part; and without coming to any
                                conclusion on the subject,
                            The Senate took a recess till two oclock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The Senate took up the consideration of the amendment of the rules
                                where it was stopped by the adjournment at noon. Messrs. Green,
                                Hamilton, Conner ad Wallace took part in the discussion.The
                                propositions to amend were adopted, and the rules, as amended, were
                                laid on the table.
                            Mr. McLEAN. I move that one hundred copies of the rules, as amended,
                                be printed, and also one hundred copies of the standing committees
                                and order of business be printed for the use of the Senate.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. GOODING moved an addition to the rules which would make it a
                                contempt of the Senate for members to bolt, and as a penalty for so
                                doing, the offending member shall be reprimanded by the President in
                                open session.
                            Mr. WEIR offered an amendment, adding the words "or any Senator
                                refusing to vote shall be liable to the same penalty."
                            A motion was made to lay the amendment and the amendment to the
                                amendment on the table. The motion was agreed to.

                            
                                GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
                                The Senate then resolved itself into a committee of the whole,
                                    (Mr. Tarkington in the chair,) and took up for consideration the
                                    Governor's Message.
                                The Secretary proceeded to read the message, when
                                Mr. SLACK moved that the reading be suspended.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr. McLAIN. I move, sir, that all that portion of the message
                                    that refers to the erection of a new State Prison, be referred
                                    to the committee on the State Prison.
                                The committee consented, and it was so referred.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. Mr. Chairman, I move that all that part of the
                                    message that refers to finance, be referred to the
                                        committee on Finance.
                                The committee consented, and it was so referred.
                                Mr. GOODING. I would inquire whether here is anything on
                                        Temperance in the message?
                                The CHAIRMAN. The Chair has not read the message.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER. I move that the committee rise
                                The motion was agreed to, and the committee accordingly rose,
                                    reported that they had had under consideration the Governor's
                                    message, had made sundry references of parts thereof, and asked
                                    leave to rise and be discharged, and it was so taken by
                                    consent.
                                The PRESIDENT. The next thing in order is bills on their second
                                    reading.
                            
                            
                                CHAIRS FOR VISITORS.
                                Mr. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to offer a resolution.
                                The resolution was read by the Secretary, as follows:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Secretary of the
                                                Senate he directed to furnish one dozen chairs to be
                                                placed in the Senate Chamber, for the use of
                                                visitors.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The resolution was adopted by consent.

                                            Resolved, That the Committee on
                                                County and Township Officers be requested to inquire
                                                into the expediency of abolishing the office of
                                                Township Trustee, substituting therefor one School
                                                Trustee, and that if expedient they report a bill to

                                The resoluiion was adopted by consent.
                            
                            
                                SCHOOL FUND.

                                    resolution:

                                                if any, has not been distributed for school
                                                purposes.

                                ADJOURNED OVER.
                                Mr. CRAVENS. I ask consent to introduce the following
                                    resolution:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That hereafter when the
                                                Senate adjourns on Saturday it will adjourn at 11
                                                o'clock A. M., and stand adjourned till 2 o'clock P.
                                                M. on Monday.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The yeas and nays were demanded.
                                Mr. CRAVENS. Mr. President, my reason for offering this
                                    resolution is that on Saturday afternoons and Monday mornings
                                    there is hardly ever more than a quorum, and our important
                                    committees will need time to sit. The committeemen are afraid
                                    the strings will be pulled in their absence, and consequently
                                    don't ask leave to sit while the Senate is in session, and so it
                                    is that the committees have no time to sit at all.
                                The yeas and nays were ordered, and being taken, resulted - yeas
                                    22, nays 25.
                                So the resolution was not adopted.
                            
                            
                                PETIT JURORS.
                                Mr. HEFFREN, by unanimous consent, introduced a bill (No. 24)
                                    entitled An act to authorize the empanneling of petit jurors in

                                    which was read through by the Secretary, and passed to a second
                                    reading.

                                    &C.
                                Mr. BOBBS, by consent, introduced a bill (No, 25) providing for
                                    the redemption or purchase of bank bonds, and Indiana and other
                                    State stocks and United States stocks, and providing for the
                                    manner of doing the same, and defining the duties of certain

                                SCHOOL FUND.
                                Mr.LINE. I ask leave to introduce the following preambles and
                                    resolution:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            WHEREAS, the General Assembly of the State of Indiana
                                                did at its first session after the adoption of the
                                                new Constitution provide for the consolidation of
                                                all the school funds, including that of the
                                                Congressional Township fund And whereas, under the
                                                law aforesaid, some of the Congressional Townships
                                                in the State did enjoin the payment of the
                                                Congressional Township (funds, which injunction was
                                                sustained by the Supreme Court of the State. And,
                                                whereas, the Legislature, at its session of 1855,
                                                did pass a law authorizing the school tax so divided
                                                as to make an equality in the school funds, by
                                                taking from those Congressional Townships that
                                                receive a larger amount of Congressional funds, an
                                                amount of the tax which will equalize the funds for
                                                educational purposes. And, whereas, under the law
                                                last aforesaid, there has been an injunction
                                                obtained in some of the County Courts to prevent the
                                                payment of said school tax as was contemplated by
                                                said law, which injunction is now pending in the
                                                United States Supreme Court, and does thereby
                                                prevent the persons who are a paying said taxes from
                                                receiving any benefit therefrom - therefore,
                                            Resolved, That the committee on
                                                education in quire whether any remedial legislation
                                                can be granted without forestalling said question
                                                pending as aforesaid - or in any way reflecting on

                                                otherwise.

                                            last Report of the State Board of Agriculture.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it is the deliberate
                                            judgement of this House, that all elections, and all
                                            subjects of general legislation should be be deferred
                                            until he next regular session; and that after the
                                            special questions for which this session has been called
                                            shall have been considered and acted upon, this House
                                            will, with the concurrence of the Senate, immediately
                                            adjourn.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. SCOTT. I move to lay the resolution on the table.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY and Mr. DOBBINS demanded the yeas and nays, and the
                                same being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 47, nays 52,as

                            Mr. RYNEARSON, when his name was called, said: It is my desire that
                                the legislation of this House should be expedited in every manner
                                compatible with the interests of our State. I feel pledged to return
                                home at as early a day as possible; but at the same time I do not
                                acknowledge the right of the Governor to dictate the policy I shall
                                pursue here. I vote aye.
                            So the resolution was not laid on the table.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I move the indefinite postponement of the resolution. It
                                is well understood, Mr Speaker, that the whole question of the
                                election of United States Senator turns upon the adoption or
                                rejection of this resolution; and, sir, for one, I am as willing to
                                make the fight on this resolution, at this stage of the game, as at
                                any other period.
                            We have been called here by the Governor to amend the defects, as he
                                says, of the legislation of the previous session, and all the
                                complaints growing out of that session are attributable to but one
                                thing, and that is the election of United States Senators. Had the
                                party then in power - the old line members of that session -
                                proceeded according to precedent in the election of these officers -
                                had they gone according to the Constitution - elected our United
                                States Senators according to the provisions of the constitution of
                                Indiana, none of those animosities resulting in defective
                                legislation, would have arisen, and nothing would have transpired to
                                authorize the call of this extra session. But there was a party in
                                the Legislature at that time that were determined, against law,
                                precedent, and the constitution, to fill those offices or United
                                States Senators, and they accomplished their object. This fact is
                                not controverted. It was admitted in all the canvassing of the late
                                election. I never heard any man on the stump, Democrat or not, that
                                did not freely grant that the election of Bright and Fitch was
                                illegal. Every man joined with the Republicans in condemning it as
                                an illegal and unconstitutional proceeding, and in alledging that
                                those men were no more entitled to places in the United States
                                Senate than they were themselves. The whole people, also, have
                                signified at the polls their opposition to that election by sending
                                up here an opposition majority in the Legislature. And now we are
                                called upon to right this usurpation of the party in power - an act
                                in which they were aided by the Governor himself - and that is to go
                                at the very root of the difficulty, and deny the right of Bright and
                                Fitch to their election, as against the constitution, and the voice
                                of the sovereign people of Indiana. I want to know whether that
                                majority is now to be bound hand and foot, or sold over to the old
                                line Democracy? For I understand that this resolution means that no
                                election for United States Senators shall come up either at this or
                                at the regular session.
                            He contended that a review of these elections lies directly in the
                                line of the duty of this Legislature. He admitted that the United
                                States Seriate would not admit the men we might elect; because he
                                believed the Old-line Democracy to be but a corrupt instrument in
                                the hands of the slave oligarchy of this country.
                            There was an acknowledged opposition majority in this Legislature,
                                sent here by constituencies opposed to the election of Bright and
                                Fitch. This question turned upon the new dogma of the Democratic
                                party, that the Constitution of the United States carries slavery
                                into the Territories.
                            Mr DOBBINS interrupted. What principle does the Republican party
                                recognize?
                            Mr MURRAY. The Republican party recognizes the principle of our
                                fathers on this question the action of the old Continental Congress
                                - the action of such men as
                                Washington, Jefferson and Madison.
                            It only remained for the oposition here to faithfully carry out the
                                object for which they were elected. There was no difference between
                                Republicans and Anti-Lecompton Democrats in this matter, and he
                                appealed to them to meet harmoniously in defense of freedom on this
                                question.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. I must confess, sir that I am somewhat astonished at the
                                gentltman from Elkhart. When we look back over the proceedings of
                                this body, we remember how often we have heard that gentleman's
                                voice in favor of economy - of attending to the subjects of
                                legislation tor which we are called together. Does not that
                                gentleman know that every day we are in session here, it costs the
                                State at least six hundred dollars per day for this branch alone?
                                and he has certainly now gone beyond the business for which we have
                                been called, in thus endeavoring to enact in this branch of the
                                Legislature, the scenes which transpired in the Senate two years
                                ago. He wishes to get up the discussion of barren political
                                questions from which no good can come. He wishes here, upon the
                                threshold of the session, to covert the Legislature into a political
                                convention, for the purpose of talking about political questions and
                                party organizations. It seems strange that a gentleman making such
                                loud professions about economy should bring up such a question at
                                this time, and ask Representatives to vote for a revisal of
                                questions that have been settled before the highest tribunals of the
                                country. It shows that his professions of economy are only made to
                                go to the country - to go to his constituents and mine, to convey to
                                them the idea that he and his associates are foremost in favoring
                                measures of economy and retrenchment. But this is taking no action.
                                It shows nothing upon the record by votes that he is in favor of
                                retrenchment; for if he were in favor of retrenchment he would vote
                                for this resolution.
                            The gentleman has seen proper to make a direct attack upon me as a
                                member of the last Legislature, as one who cast his vote in that
                                body for Bright and Fitch. It is well known to you, sir, as one of
                                the members of that House of Representatives, that there were three
                                hundred and sixty-five bills introduced and acted upon in that body;
                                and that those very bills upon which we are now called upon to act,
                                were passed through this branch of the General Assembly by the
                                Democrats of that House of Representatives. It is known to you, sir,
                                that these measures were sent to the Republican Senate of that
                                Legislature, and that if that body had acted in accordance with the
                                letter and spirit of the Constitution of the State of Indiana, there
                                would have been no necessity for this extra session of the
                                Legislature. They would have passed the appraisement bill and the
                                revenue bill, and made provision for carrying on the government of
                                the State. But failing then to pass these bills, the responsibility
                                and all the expense of this called session rested on the gentleman's
                                party. I here to-day put it down upon them, and if this called
                                session should cost the State $60,000, the Republican party has all
                                the responsibility to bear. I am not here to defend the course
                                pursued by the last Senate, but to defend my own course, in which I
                                have been fully justified before my constiuents. I went before my
                                constiuents, and I proudly held up before them the Journal of the
                                former House of Representatives, and they returned me with an
                                increased majority. Such is the understanding of what is right and
                                wrong in Southern Indiana. They frowned on the Journal of the
                                Senate, and applauded that of the House of Reprsentatives of the
                                last Legislature.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY called the gentleman from Martin to order, under the
                                14th rule, but did not insist on the point.
                            Mr. DOBBINS continued. I was going to remark, that it is not my
                                province on this occasion to enter into the field of partizan
                                politics, as the gentleman from Elkhart has done, neither am I going
                                to show up the curruptions of the opposition. This is not the arena
                                for such contests. I have been called here to attend to business for
                                the people of Indiana, and this resolution calls us directly to
                                that. It asks members whether they are in favor of attending to the
                                requirements of the people, or whether they will lengthen out the
                                session by such discussions a? the gentleman has broached. The
                                gentleman has made his appeal to the House and called upon
                                Anti-Lecompton Democrats to stand and vote with him; but I apprehend
                                those Anti-Lecompton Democrats understand their duty to represent
                                questions affecting the interests of the people better than to vote
                                for bringing up questions about the power of the Senate of the
                                United States to decide upon the qualifications of their own
                                members. I apprehend that they know their duty too well to consume
                                time about matters which the gentleman himself admits will be
                                useless - which can have no effect whatever upon the decision of the
                                Senate of the United States.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY. I did not introduce this resolution for political
                                purposes or as a party man, for the purpose of getting the views of
                                this House on the question, whether we should launch out into the
                                subjects unconnected with State legislation into the discussion on
                                political questions and the election of officers at this session, or
                                whether we should attend to the special matters of pressing
                                necessity for which we were called together. I introduced this
                                resolution, Mr Speaker, for the reason that I believed that had not
                                these extraneous matters been brought before this body at this extra
                                session, its duration would not be prolonged to the extent of the
                                constitutional limit. If we attend to the special matters for which
                                the session has been called we can get home at an early day; and as
                                the regular session is not far distant we can take up these other
                                questions of the election of officers and find time, if it must be
                                so, to discuss political questions. This resolution of mine is a
                                resolution of the House merely - not a joint resolution - introduced
                                solely for the purpose of testing the opinion of the House and its
                                choice between action upon subjects of general legislation, and the
                                special matters for which the session has been called. This
                                resolution agrees substantially with the joint resolution introduced
                                the other day by the gentleman from Boone, but his is a joint
                                resolution which will require some time to be disposed of. I put the
                                proposition in the form of a House resolution that it might be
                                disposed of at once and without
                                debate. I had no political motive in the matter. I was glad that the
                                House refused to lay it on the table. I desire to call the attention
                                of the House and the country to the fact that the question of
                                politics was introduced upon this floor, first by the gentleman from
                                Wayne in relation to the election of Senators of the United States;
                                and that the gentleman from Elkhart has seen the first to invoke
                                discussion thereupon. I rejoice that the introduction of political
                                matter has not come from the Democratic side of the House, but the
                                Republican side. But, sir, although the attempt to interrupt the
                                smooth current of legislation by lugging in political questions has
                                come up thus from the other side, I hope it will not be endorsed by
                                them as a party. I rejoice in the indication adverse to this course,
                                manifested in the vote by which the House voted down the motion to
                                lay this resolution on the table - the motion was voted down by
                                Republicans as well as Democrats, and I hope they will not now take
                                the back track, although the gentleman from Elkhart has cracked the
                                whip over their heads.
                            Mr. AUSTIN next addressed the House, defining and defending his
                                position to the questions involved in the premises - making a
                                constitutional argument in support of his resolution.
                            Mr. THOMPSON, of Madison, desired to introduce a resolution to limit
                                speech to fifteen minutes, which was ruled out of order.
                            Mr. SCOTT insisted that the power of the Governor over this body is
                                merely advisory; and whilst the Representatives were fresh from the
                                people, they were presumed to know what the people desire better
                                than the Governor He also deprecated political speaking in the
                                House; and was as much disposed to economize in time and in
                                everything else as any other gentlemen on this floor; but he
                                submitted the consideration that it would require no more time to do
                                the work of the Legislature now than in the course of the regular
                                session. It was not to be supposed that this body would not know
                                when they had got through with the necessary business of the
                                session. The resolution was useless, and he believed it was
                                introduced for political effect. He was therefore in favor of
                                indefinite postponement.
                            Mr. DAVIS endeavored to show, under the 53d rule of the House, that
                                the consideration of the resolution was out of order until to-morrow
                                - it being a proposition to amend the rules.
                            After debate - 
                            The SPEAKER (Mr. Colgrove in the chair) overruled the point of
                                order.
                            Mr. Speaker GORDON then addressed the House at length in support of
                                the resolution; finding sundry reasons therefor in the necessity
                                which he alleged existed for an investigation of the various offices
                                of the State and the collection of specific abuses in the shape of
                                perquisites to salaried officers.
                            After further debate by Messrs. Harney, Millett, Boyd, and Nebeker,
                                of Warren - 
                            Mr. MERRIFIELD said he should vote against the motion to postpone, in
                                order that he might have an opportunity to submit an amendment,
                                which would strike out all after the word "resolved" in the
                                resolution, and insert words to this effect: "That it is inexpedient
                                for this House to take any action respecting the election of United
                                States Senators during the present session; but that it should
                                confine its action exclusively to measures recommended in the
                                Governor's Message and other matters of pressing importance, and the
                                legislation of the State."
                            Mr. Scott and Mr. Dougherty demanded the yeas and nays on the
                                indefinite postponement of the resolution and they were ordered, and
                                being taken, resulted - yeas 48, nays 46
                            So the resolution was indefinitely postponed.The House then took a
                                recess until two o'clock P.M.
                        

                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On motion of Mr. MERRIFIELD, Mr, Stanfield had leave of absence till
                                Monday; and Mr. Merrifield had leave to pair off with Mr. Stanfield
                                in the meantime.
                            Mr. TURPIE. Mr. Speaker, I desire to inquire under what rule the
                                    Standing Committee on Apportionment was
                                appointed.
                            The SPEAKER. It was appointed by resolution.
                            Mr. TURPIE, The resolution dqes not authorize the appointment.
                            The SPEAKER. It was understood to authorize it. Resolutions are in
                                order.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That two hundred copies of
                                            the Lists of Standing Committees and the Order of
                                            Business be printed for the use of this House.
                                    
                                
                            

                            
                                POSTAGE STAMPS.
                                Mr. SHULL submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper
                                                purchase, for the use of each member of this House,
                                                three dollars' worth of postage stamps - two-thirds
                                                of which shall be one cent stamps, to be delivered
                                                at the desks.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. MURRAY demanded the yeas and nays on this resolution, and
                                    they were ordered.
                                Mr. SCOTT proposed to amend by striking out "three" and inserting
                                    "two"dollars' worth.
                                Mr. SHULL accepted.
                                Mr. KEEPER made an ineffectual motion to make them all one cent
                                    stamps.
                                Mr. SMITH, of Miami, stated that he had paired off with Mr
                                    Knowlton, who had gone home on account of ill health.
                                The yeas and nays being now taken, resulted - yeas 50, nays
                                    46.
                                So the resolution was adopted.
                                Mr. MURRAY submitted the following, which was adopted by
                                    consent:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                                instructed to ascertain the amount chargeable for
                                                postage on all the mailable matter printed by order
                                                of this House, and post the same up in some
                                                conspicuous place in the Stationery room.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
                                Mr. ROBINSON submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That two members be added
                                                to the Judiciary Committee in the place of those who
                                                have been excused from, service thereon.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The SPEAKER. That will be done as a matter of course.
                                Mr. COLGROVE. I move to amend by making it a proposition to
                                    increase the number of the committee to nine.
                                
                                Mr. ROBINSON acquiesced, and so the resolution was adopted.

                                Mr. MURRAY submitted the following, which was adopted:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                                authorized to have the three copies of the two

                                Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren, submitted a preamble and resolution to
                                    the effect that
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            WHEREAS, Article V, section 3 of the Constitution of
                                                Indiana provides that the school fund may be
                                                increased, but not diminished; AND WHEREAS,in 1853
                                                about eight hundred thousand dollars was due to the
                                                school fund; AND WHEREAS, it has since been
                                                increased to nine hundred and twenty-eight thousand
                                                dollars,as shown by the report of the Superintendent
                                                of Public Instruction, page 54: Therefore, be it
                                            Resolved, That the
                                                  committee on Education be
                                                instructed to introduce a bill more effectually to
                                                secure said fund.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The preamble and resolution was adopted.
                            
                            
                                THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON (Mr. Edwards in the chair) submitted a
                                    resolution to the effect that the Auditor of State be requested
                                    to furnish this House immediately with statements showing what
                                    amounts of money was audited for services rendered the State by
                                    various persons acting as Attorney General for the State, making
                                    five particulars, which was adopted.
                            
                            
                                THE GOVERNOR'S PERQUISITES.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON also submitted a resolution requiring the
                                    Auditor of State to furnish this House, as soon as practicable,
                                    full and complete information touching all sums of money audited
                                    to Joseph A. Wright, as Governor of the State of Indiana, from
                                    the first day of November, 1851, to the expiration of his term,
                                    making a distinction between monies audited on account of salary
                                    and those connected with the swamp land interest; also,
                                    statements of monies audited on account of the Governor's house,
                                    and furnishing the same; on account of gardener and other
                                    servant hire; and also on every other account, and that he
                                    furnish a statement of all monies audited on these several
                                    accounts to the present Governor down to the present time.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON. One word of explanation. I commence the date
                                    of these inquiries at the time when the new Constitution was
                                    adopted and went into operation, because the new Constitution
                                    cuts off from the Governor all perquisites. I want to see
                                    whether any perquisites have been allowed that officer not
                                    authorized by law.
                                The resolution was adopted.
                            
                            
                                STATE LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON submitted another resolution to the effect
                                    that the Auditor of State be required to furnish this House
                                    immediately with full information of all sums of money audited
                                    in favor of John B. Dillon, as State Librarian, during the term
                                    he held that office; also, of all sums audited in favor of other
                                    persons, as his assistants, during the same period, including
                                    monies audited for the State House, &c.; and a like
                                    statement of all monies audited to Nathaniel Bolton, for like
                                    purposes, during the period of his term; also,a like statement
                                    during the period that office was held by Gordon Tanner; also, a
                                    like statement to embrace the term of the present incumbent of
                                    that office; and that in all cases these statements set forth
                                    for what particular service such sums have been audited and
                                    paid.
                            
                            
                                SUPREME COURT CLERK'S OFFICE.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON also submitted a resolution to the effect that
                                    the Auditor be required to furnish this House immediately, with
                                    a full statement of monies audited in favor of the present
                                    incumbent of the Supreme Court Clerk's Office, from the day of
                                    his first induction in that office to the present time, and that
                                    in such state ment he set forth, &c.
                                Mr. CLEMENTS moved to strike out "immediately." This word
                                    occurring in so many resolutions seemed to him unreasonable.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON acquiesced in the modification, so as to read
                                    "at his earliest convenience."So the resolution was adopted.
                            
                            
                                SWAMP LAND LAW.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON submitted a resolution to this effect:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            that the Committee on the
                                                  Judiciary be instructed to inquire into
                                                the constitutionality of that portion of Chapter 59
                                                of the Acts of the General Assembly for the year
                                                1857, subsequent to the first Section thereof, and
                                                that they make report of the same to his House as
                                                soon as possible.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                That is the swampland law of 1857. A few years ago the Government
                                    told us that we had a swamp land fund donated by the General
                                    Government of the value of one million two hundred thousand
                                    dollars The people want to know what has become of that fund.
                                    Years have passed since these lands were in the possession of
                                    the State, and the people have received nothing in the way of
                                    proceeds. I desire to know whether that fund is fixed in the
                                    hands of those who have robbed the children of their bread and
                                    given it to the dogs. As an incipient step to that inquiry I
                                    want to know whether that law is constitutional or otherwise.
                                    For my part I do not think it is constitutional; and I will
                                    endeavor to satisfy the House of that myself, if the committee
                                    do not.
                                The resolution was adopted.
                            
                            
                                DISBURSEMENTS OF FUNDS.
                                Mr. MURRAY submitted the following, which was adopted:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the
                                                  committee on the Judiciary be
                                                instructed to inquire into the expediency of
                                                reporting a bill fixing a penality upon any
                                                disbursement of the public funds without the
                                                authority of law.

                                Mr. SULLIVAN submitted the following, which was adopted:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                                and he is hereby authorized to obtain copies of the
                                                report of the Committee on Bank
                                                  Frauds, and lay one copy of the same on
                                                the desk of each member of this House.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. BOYD submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That it is the opinion of
                                                this House that the present judiciary system of the
                                                State is both inefficient and expensive, and that in
                                                ouropinion it ought to be so changed as to dispense
                                                with the court of Common Pleas and allow the Circuit
                                                Court to convene three times in each year; and that
                                                this resolution be referred to the
                                                  Committee on the Judiciary,
                                                with instructions to make the said changes.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    THE LEGISLATIVE SENTINEL.

                            Mr. COLGROVE was in favor of the object of the resolution, but
                                opposed to its imperative style. He moved to amend by striking out
                                and inserting "and that they have leave to report by bill or
                                otherwise."
                            Mr. BOYD, It is not imperative. My design is to draw out an
                                expression of opinion whether or not these charges should be made. I
                                accept, however.
                            Mr. MILLETT moved ineffectually to refer the resolution to the
                                    Committee on the Organization of the Courts of
                                    Justice.
                            The resolution was then adopted,
                        
                        
                            VENTILLATION OF THE HALL.
                            Mr. CLEMENTS moved a resolution for the appointment of a committee of
                                three to provide for a better ventillation of the Hall; which was
                                adopted, and the Speaker appointed Messrs. Clements, Sullivan and
                                Hamilton of Wayne.
                        
                        
                            MEMBERS COMPENSATION.
                            Mr. HUNTER submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Judiciary be instructed to examine
                                            the law, as it exists, and see if there is any law
                                            authorizing compensation to the members of the
                                            Legislature for their services.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE.
                            Mr. DOBBINS submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Aditor of State be
                                            requested to report at the earliest practicable period,
                                            the accounts audited in his office against the former
                                            Auditor of State, his immediate predecessor; also thit
                                            he submit similar reports of amounts audited against the
                                            present incumbent.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            CONVENTIONAL INTEREST.
                            Mr. SHULL submitted a resolution directing the Committee on
                                    Ways and Means to inquire into the expediency of so
                                changing the law of interest as to allow a conventional interest not
                                exceeding twelve per cent, per annum.
                            The resolution was rejected.
                        
                        
                            UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            On motion of Mr. AUSTIN the House now took up his resolution
                                condemnatory of the election of United States Senators by the last
                                Legislaturethe question being on the motion to indefinitely
                                postpone.
                            Mr. EDWARDS, Mr. Speaker, I move to commit the resolution to a select
                                committee of three, with the following instructions:
                            "To inquire whether Messrs. Jesse D. Bright and Graham N. Fitch were
                                elected to the Senate of the United States in pursuance of the
                                Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and Laws of
                                the State of Indiana; and, if they were not so elected, to report
                                what I course the General Assembly of the State of Indiana should
                                pursue in relation thereto."
                            Mr EDWARDS briefly supported this proposition.
                            Mr. TURPIE. I shall vote against committal. We are all well enough
                                advised of the facts. There is no use of a committee. It will merely
                                occupy the time of those composing the committee for a purpose
                                entirely nugatory. I move to lay the motion to commit on the
                                table.
                            The SPEAKER decided this motion out of order. The yeas and nays
                                having been ordered - 
                            Mr. BLYTHE opposed commitment, and gave notice of an amendment to the
                                resolution by way of substitute, which he desired to have an
                                opportunity to place upon record.
                            Mr. MURRAY was willing to submit to any investigation on this
                                subject, and to discussion also, or amendment, if gentlemen
                                desire.

                            Mr. CLEMENTS, on reflection, was ready to meet the storm. The Senate
                                of the United States had decided on the legality of the election of
                                our Senators; and it was perfectly farcical to make any declaration
                                or taking any action here in the matter.
                            Mr. DOBBINS explained his vote about to be given. There was no
                                necessity ibr referring this subject which had already been
                                investigated and settled by the highest authority.
                            Mr. HALL, of Rush, spoke in favor of reference. He was not certain
                                that our election of other Senators would do no good. Whether our
                                Senators to be elected ever get their seats or not, it was important
                                that the voice of the Legislature and the people should be beard in
                                the case.
                            Mr. GIFFORD had prepared a substitute, which he read in these
                                words:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        "Resolved, That the State of Indiana is
                                            at this time legally and constitutionally represented in
                                            the Senate of the United States, and that this House
                                            would deem it a perfect farce to go into the election of
                                            United States Senators at this session,"
                                    
                                
                            
                            The SPEAKER ruled the substitute out of order.
                            Mr. MERRIFIELD opposed the reference, because it could not affect the
                                minds of men so well made up. The matter had been passed upon by the
                                highest tribunals, and the arguing whether it was right or wrong,
                                would be manifestly most improper. The time of the session might be
                                spent just as well about inquiry into the decisions of the Supreme
                                Court of the United States. Again, there was not probably a lawyer
                                on this floor that knew that the Senate of the United States could
                                not review and reverse their decision of this matter if they were
                                disposed to. It would be just as competent for the Suprerne Court to
                                sit upon its errors.
                            Mr. AUSTIN gave reasons for the vote he was to give. The object of
                                this reference was to give opportunity for an intelligent vote.
                            Mr. BAIRD replied to Mr. Merrifield, and asked if the Supreme Court
                                could not admit a re-hearing of any matter decided by that tribunal?
                                     That was all we wanted - a
                                re-hearing in the Senate of the United States.
                            Mr. DAVIS occupied a peculiar position. Why should we attempt a
                                foolish and a vain thing? God knows if he had the power, no man
                                would be more ready than he to send up men from this body to the
                                Senate of the United States who would represent the State of Indiana
                                aright. At the time of the election of Bright and Fitch, he thought
                                it was irregular, and ought to be reversed. But action had been
                                taken, and that action was irrevocable. He would go for an election
                                to fill the place of Mr. Fitch, according to a recent precedent in
                                the Legislature of the State of Tennessee. If gentlemen desired to
                                express themselves as indignant, let them do so. With reference to
                                the length of the session, he was willing they should proceed and
                                elect all the officers they desired. Both parties were to blame at
                                the last Legislature, and the people had so decided. Representatives
                                were not sent here to act in little party caucuses, but to represent
                                grave public interests. He was for attending to the business
                                included in the Executive recommendation, and these included, he
                                thought, too much, rather than too little. The people had more to
                                fear from too much than from too little legislation. He wanted to go
                                on the record upon the proposition of his friend from Vanderburg,
                                and then would leave the House to dispose of the question as it
                                pleased them.
                            The yeas and nays were taken on the motion to refer the resolution to
                                a select committee, resulting - yeas 44, nays 54. So the House
                                refused to commit.
                            Mr BLYTHE now proposed to strike out all after the resolving clause
                                and insert to the following effect:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        "That in the judgment of this House the election of the
                                            Hon. Graham N. Fitch and the Hon. Jesse D. Bright to the
                                            Senate of the United States by the General Assembly of
                                            the State, at the session of the year 1857, was improper
                                            and irregular, and that the course of these gentlemen in
                                            demanding and receiving seats in the Senate of the
                                            United States, is worthy of censure."
                                        "Resolved, further, That it is to be
                                            regretted that the Senate of the United States, by their
                                            resolution of the 12th of June, 1858 (recites the
                                            resolution) has pronounced a final judgment, which
                                            preclules this General Assembly from making further
                                            inquiry into the legality of the seats so held by the
                                            two Senators aforesaid."
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BLYTHE. I do not design or desire to make extended remarks,
                                either on this amendment or on the original resolution. But that I
                                may be distinctly understood, I will say that the language of those
                                two resolutions which I have offered by way of substitute, contain a
                                tolerably clear statement of the position I occupy. I am not here,
                                Mr. Speaker, to act with either of the parties in this House, except
                                in so far as they may be in the right. Like the gentleman from
                                Floyd, I exceedingly regret the state of facts which has brought
                                about the occupancy of seats in the Senate of the United States, by
                                Messrs. Fitch and Bright. Had I the power these gentlemen would not
                                occupy those seats. Had I the power, constitutionally, legally,
                                rightfully to do so, I would deprive them of their seats. But I
                                believe there is no safety for us, as citizens or as legislators,
                                except in a strong, conscientious and uniform adherence to the
                                decisions of law.
                            The decision of the Senate of the United States is law; it is a
                                judicial decision, pronounced by a competent tribunal, and coming
                                properly before that tribunal. That decision I have no right to call
                                in question here in the mode proposed in the original resolution. In
                                part it is a position I accept: and I regret that the Senate of the
                                United States has, by its resolution admitting these gentlemen to
                                seats in the Senate of the United States, precluded any inquiry into
                                the constitutionality or propriety of their decision.
                            After an ineffectual motion by Mr. Dobbins to adjourn - 
                            Mr. BLYTHE'S amendment was rejected by yeas 9, nays 83; and then - 
                            Under the force of the previous question, the main question, viz:
                                Shall Mr. Austin's resolution pass? was decided by yeas 51, nays 45
                                - as follows:

                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            SATURDAY, November 27, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read.
                        
                            BANK REPORT.
                            The PRESIDENT. I will lay before the Senate a report of the Branch of
                                the Bank of the State of Indiana at Terre Haute.
                            The Secretary proceeded to read the report, when a motion was made to
                                dispense with the reading, and lay upon the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            AUTHORIZING A LOAN.
                            Mr. STEVENS. I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Finance be instructed to report a bill
                                            authorizing the Treasurer of State to negotiate a loan
                                            from the Sinking Fund, or from some other source,
                                            sufficient in amount to meet all demands referred to in
                                            the Governor's message, and that we deem it inexpedient
                                            to levy a tax at this session, for any purpose,
                                            whatever, to make up any deficiency caused by failure to
                                            pass the revenue and appropriation bills at the session
                                            of 1857.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. STEVENS sustained his resolution in a few remarks. The people of
                                the State were not willing at this time to pay a heavy tax. In many
                                counties of the State there had not been enough corn raised for
                                their own consumption, and they would have to go to other counties,
                                or another State to get grain for their own use, and, besides, they
                                have in many counties built expensive courthouses and other public
                                buildings, and they are already overtaxed. For these and other
                                considerations, he was in favor
                                of the passage of the resolution.
                            The resolution was laid on the table.
                            Mr. STEVENS. I hope a reconsideration of the vote will be had in
                                order that I may make it a resolution of inquiry.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I move a reconsideration of the vote.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. STEVENS. I now move to amend by making it a resolution of
                                inquiry. [Strike out the word "report," and insert in lieu thereof
                                the words "inquire into the expediency of reporting.]
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                            Mr. JOHNSON moved to strike out the last clause in the
                                resolution.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent, and the resolution, as amended,
                                was adopted.
                        
                        
                            ALLEN MAY.
                            Mr. WEIR. I offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Attorney General be
                                            requested to inform the Senate at the earliest
                                            opportunity the condition of the claim of the State of
                                            Indiana against one Allen May, indorsed by Messrs.
                                            Bright and Drake, the amount thereof, and what steps
                                            have been taken to collect the same, since the
                                            adjournment of the last Legislature, and if the game has
                                            not been sued, the reason fur such neglect.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            ACCOUNTS OF THE TREASURER OF STATE.
                            Mr. WALLACE. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of five be
                                            appointed to examine and report the condition of the
                                            affairs of Treasurer of State, with reference
                                            particularly to the accounts of the said Treasurer, and
                                            all other matters pertaining to his office and late
                                            report.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. WALLACE. I will just say, Mr. President, that this is done at the
                                request of the Treasurer of State himself.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I will suggest that the Finance
                                    Committee would attend to this matter.
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                            The PRESIDENT appointed Senators Wallace, Heffren, Cravens, Cooper
                                and McLain said committee.
                        
                        
                            COMMON PLEAS JURORS.
                            Mr. McLAIN. I offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Organization of Courts be directed
                                            to inquire into the expediency of the entire abolition
                                            of the regular panel of jurymen, for the Court of Common
                                            Pleas, and that if the same be deemed expedient, the
                                            said committee report a bill to that effect, at as early
                                            a day as practicable.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. McLAIN Senators will remember that this jury is a very expensive
                                one, and that very often we have had an entire court without this
                                jury being once empaneled. I apprehend that there is no need of
                                having a regular jury; but that these juries could be selected as
                                occasion might require from the by-standers.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            STATE PRISON.
                            Mr. WEIR. I offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on State Prison be instructed to visit the
                                            same at some convenient time during the special session
                                            and make an examination thereof in order for them to be
                                            able to report to the Senate the necessities of the
                                            same.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            PRINTING.
                            Mr. HILL. I offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Printing be instructed to inquire into
                                            the expediency of so changing the law as to let the
                                            public printing to the lowest bidder.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TILL MONDAY.
                            Mr. GREEN. I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That when the Senate adjourn,
                                            it adjourn until Monday at two o'clock.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HENDRY. I desire to remark that we have had a Thanksgiving day
                                this week, which we adjourned over, and it strikes me that it would
                                be improper to adjourn till Monday afternoon. Some Senators are from
                                a distant portion of the State, and I apprehend they came here to
                                stay during this session, as it is a duty they owe to the country.
                                It would be very convenient to go home and stay half the time; but
                                then we have started out to be economical, and we should keep it up.
                                I hope Senators will consider the matter, agree to remain a week or
                                two, and then if desirable let us have a holiday or two so that
                                members from a distance can go home and see their families.
                            Mr. GOODING. The committees have been appointed; they will have to
                                examine questions of law and propose bills; it is important that
                                those committees have some time to act, and they can not act when
                                the Senate is in session.
                            Mr. WEIR. Do you not desire to go home?
                            Mr. GOODING. I will, probably, if the Senate adjourn over; but I say
                                it will be a saving of time. I shall vote for it upon that
                                consideration, and upon no personal consideration whatever.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN. During the last session I remember distinctly of being
                                the Chairman of the Committee on Claims of the
                                other end of this House, and I know on Saturday afternoons that I
                                could not parade two members of the committee - they were all gone
                                home. I think these limited sessions should be abolished,, and that
                                members should be paid a stipulated salary, and then when they must
                                run home let them do it at their own expense.
                            Mr. GREEN. This is my second session here, and I have never known any
                                business done on Saturday afternoons and Monday mornings. I know
                                enough going away this afternoon, whether we adjourn over or not, to
                                prevent any business being done; and it will be Monday noon before
                                they get back.
                            Mr. CONNER spoke in favor of the resolution.
                            Mr HENDRY. I would propose a plan, and that is to agree upon some
                                day, and then adjourn over a day or two, or three, and let us all go
                                home and have a jollification.
                            Mr. JOHNSON. I have not been in the habit of asking the Senate to
                                adjourn.
                            Mr. WALLACE, (interposing.) I want the Senator to make a speech for
                                me too.
                            Mr. JOHNSON. Now, sir, the reason why we ought to adjourn over to
                                give us a chance to go home is this: Some of us have left our farms,
                                and have farming interests to attend to. This is my case, and I know
                                my constituents knew I would attend to my own personal business when
                                they elected me; and in order to, do it I am in favor of adjourning
                                over.
                            
                            Mr. STEELE. I shall vote for the resolution as a matter of economy. I
                                have heard this question discussed over and over again. We will
                                always find ourselves with very few members present every Saturday
                                afternoon that we have a session,
                            The yeas and nayd were demanded, and being ordered and taken,
                                resulted - yeas 26, nays 24.
                            Mr. WALLACE, when his name was called, said: In order to accommodate
                                some of my friends, who want to go home, I vote "Aye."
                            Mr. WEIR, when his name was called, said: In order to accommodate
                                gentlemen, I vote "Aye." I intended to vote the other way.
                            So the resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY CLERKS.
                            Mr. McLEAN. I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                                Committee be directed to report a Bill
                                            requiring County Clerks to pay over all monies in their
                                            hands to their successors in office, in all cases not
                                            already provided for by law, if the said Committee
                                            shall, upon investigation, deem the same expedient.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            CHANGE OF VENUE.
                            Mr. McLAIN. I, also, offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                                Committee be requested to inquire into the
                                            expediency of passing an act by which a party can have a
                                            change of venue from the Common Pleas Court to the
                                            Circuit Court, upon the affidavit of the party that he
                                            can not have affidavit and impartial trial of his case
                                            in such court owing to the prejudice or bias of the
                                            judge of such Common Pleas Court, and that if the same
                                            be deemed expedient the said Committee report a bill
                                            authorizing such change of venue to be made.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. WALLACE. That is law now.
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            PRINTING THE LAWS.
                            Mr. CONNER. Mr. President: I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Judiciary be instructed to inquire
                                            into the expediency of providing by law, for the
                                            publication of all Acts of the General Assembly which
                                            contain an "emergency clause," in at least one
                                            newspaper, in each of the several counties of the State,
                                            where one is published.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            STATE OFFICERS' REPORTS FOR 1857.
                            Mr. HENDRY. I offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Secretary of State
                                            be requested to report to the Senate the number of the
                                            reports of the State Officers for the year 1857, that
                                            were published.
                                        Also, what number of the same remain on hand.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HENDRY. It is customary after these reports have been printed to
                                have them filed in some of the State offices, and there left to rot.
                                The object of this resolution is to ascertain the number now on
                                hand, so as to put them to use.
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            TAXING REAL ESTATE BELONGING TO CORPORATIONS.
                            Mr. MILLER. I would ask leave to make the following report:
                            Mr. PRESIDENT, The Select Committee to whom was referred the Bill No. 5, for the purpose of
                                taxing real estate belonging to corporations, in the counties in
                                which said real estate is situated, have unanimously instructed me
                                to report the same back and recommend its passage.
                            Mr. HENDRY. I was not on this committee, but I have examined this
                                bill carefully, and think it ought to pass. Hundreds of acres of
                                land in my county have been put into Railroad companies as stock,
                                for which not one cent of taxes has been collected. Railroad
                                companies should pay taxes on their lands, in the county where the
                                land lies, whether their road runs through it or not.
                            Mr. MILLER. I desire simply to say that in the county I reside, I
                                don't know but that there are twenty thousand acres of land
                                belonging to Railroad companies, from which not one cent of taxes
                                has been collected. But I don't think it necessary to advocate the
                                passage of this bill.
                            Mr. GREEN. I understand that the taxes of Railroad companies are
                                collected at the principal depot in the State. If the county
                                officers have allowed the list of lands belonging to the companies
                                to go off their books it is their own fault.
                            Mr. MILLER. In our county they have stricken these lands from the tax
                                duplicate.
                            Mr. GREEN. The advantage of the law by which the taxes are
                                distributed to the counties all along the line of the road, is that
                                we are certain to get all the taxes.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I would inquire whether it would not be proper to embrace
                                this bill in the regular taxation bill?
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. I am desirous that this bill should pass; it ought to
                                have been law for years past. In my county there are several
                                townships of land belonging to Railroad companies that have not been
                                taxed upon the duplicate for years. This is wrong. At the last
                                session of the General Assembly a proposition of this kind was
                                passed through the other end of the Capitol in a general bill. That
                                bill for the appraisement of real estate failed to become a law. Now
                                I desire that this single proposition,unconnected with anything
                                else, should become a law.
                            Senators Hamilton, Tarkington and Stevens made further remarks upon
                                the subject, when - 
                            Mr. GREEN moved to refer it again to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary with special instructions.
                            Mr. STEVENS. I second the motion to recommit.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            TOWNSHIP BUSINESS.
                            Mr. WALLACE. I wish the permission of the Senate to take up the bill
                                having reference to the organization of townships, which I
                                introduced yesterday. The object of this is to get a reference as
                                soon as possible. Every Senator agrees that the bill is of great
                                importance and should be considered as early as possible. I move
                                that the rules be suspended, and that bill No. 23 be taken up.
                            The resolution was agreed to; and the Secretary read the bill through
                                the second time.
                            Mr. McCLURE. I move that the bill be referred to the
                                    Committee on County and Township
                                business.
                            The motion was agreed; to by consent.
                            Mr. WALLACE. I wish to have it referred to that committee, perfected
                                as far as possible; report it back to the Senate, print it, and then
                                put it through the Committee of the Whole.

                            Mr. HILL. I would ask the consent of the Senate to take up bill No.
                                8.
                            
                            The PRESIDENT. The Secretary informs me that the bill is in the hands
                                of the printers.
                            Mr. HILL. I move that the bill be referred to the Committee
                                    on Temperance.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.

                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I wish to take up bill No. 3
                            The bill (No. 3) for the re
                                appraisement of real estate was taken up.
                            Mr. LINE. Was not the bill on the same sub-feet, introduced by the
                                Senator from Washington, made the order ior 2 o'clock, Monday?
                            The PRESIDENT. It was so ordered by the Senate.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I move, then, that it be referred to the Committee of
                                the Whole House aud made the special order for Monday, 2
                                o'clock.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                            Mr. GREEN. I move that bill No. 22, upon the same subject, be taken
                                up, and that the same reference be made.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.

                                their places.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TILL MONDAY.
                            Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That when this House
                                            adjourns, it shall be till Monday at 2 o'clock P.M.
                                    
                                
                            
                            I have several reasons, Mr. Speaker, for offering that resolution.
                                One is, that unless we give the committees some time for
                                organization and examination of subjects, it will be impossible for
                                them to make reports to this House. I for one am unwilling to remain
                                in the House all day and then work at night on the committees.
                                Another reason is, that the health of members demand this recess. We
                                cannot prudently occupy more than five days in the week, sueh
                                weather as this, in this House. There is another reason: for the two
                                last sessions never more than once or twice were we able to have a
                                quorum on Saturday evening and Monday morning.
                            The SPEAKER stated that at this present time the rain was dripping
                                through the roof on the Clerks desk, so as to render it nearly
                                impossible to proceed with business.
                            Mr. STILES proposed to amend, so as to read,"That all adjournments on
                                Saturday shall be at eleven o'clock A. M., till Monday at two
                                o'clock P. M.
                            Mr. BRANHAM accepted:
                            And so the resolution was adopted - affirmative 62, negative not
                                counted.
                        
                        
                            LIBERTY OF SPEECH.
                            Mr. TREADWAY submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That no member shall speak
                                            more than ten minutes at one time to the same question,
                                            without leave of the House.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MURRAY proposed fifteen minutes.
                            Mr. POWER twenty minutes.
                            On motion by Mr. TURPIE, the resolution and pending amendments, were
                                laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            COMMITTEE ON SWAMP LANDS.
                            Mr. TURPIE moved an order, that Mr. Snyder, of Jasper, be added to
                                the Committee on Swamp Lands.
                            
                            The SPEAKER suggested Mr. Merrifield, also.
                            Mr. TURPIE acquiesced, and so the order was adopted.
                        
                        
                            INDIANA UNIVERSITY.
                            Mr. ROW submitted the following, which was adopted by consent:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper be and
                                            he is hereby authorized to lay upon the tables of
                                            members such numbers as they are entitled to, of the
                                            catalogues and reports of the Board of Trustees of the
                                            Indiana University for the years 1857 and 1858.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            Mr. PARRETT submitted the following
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS, By the Constitution of the United States each
                                            House of Congress is judge of the election and
                                            qualification of its own members; AND WHEREAS, the
                                            Senate of the United Statee did, on the 12th of June,
                                            1858, declare and adjudge, that Graham N. Fitch and
                                            Jessee D. Bright, Senators returned and admitted from
                                            the State of Indiana, were entitled to the seats they
                                            now hold as Senators aforesaid the former till the 4th
                                            of March, 1861, and the latter till the 4th of March,
                                            1863, according to the tenor of their respective
                                            credentials; therefore,
                                        Resolved, That we recognize such
                                            decision of the Senate of the United States as a final
                                            adjudication of the right of these Senators to ther
                                            respective seats; that, whatever may be the opinion of
                                            members as to the legality or the illegality of said
                                            election, we have no power to review the facts, or
                                            declare void the said decision made as aforesaid by the
                                            Senate of the United States; that we acquiesce in said
                                            decision, and that we deem it unwise, inexpedient,
                                            un-constitutional and irregular for this House to
                                            entertain any motion or resolution for the election of
                                            United Senators at the present session.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The SPEAKER ruled this resolution out of orderas in conflict with the
                                resolution of Mr. Austin, adopted yesterday.
                            Mr. PARRETT. The resolution of the gentleman from Wayne involves but
                                one point, and that is, the illegality of the election of United
                                States Senators in 1857. This resolution says nothing whatever of
                                the opinion of members as-to the legality or illegality of that
                                election, but that acquiescing in the decision had thereon, we will
                                entertain no motion or resolution for the election of Senators at
                                the present session of the Legislature. This is the point involved,
                                and it has no bearing upon the matter embraced in the other
                                resolution, as I understand the two.
                            The SPEAKER read Mr. Austin's resolution,  and decided that Mr. Parrett's
                                resolution would be a reversal of its declaration.
                            Mr. PARRETT. I respectfully ask for an appeal from the ruling of the
                                Chair.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I would suggest that the gentleman reduce his appeal to
                                writing.
                            The SPEAKER. It must be so done before it can be considered.
                            Mr. PARRETT wrote to this effect: "The Speaker decides that the
                                resolution of the gentleman from Wayne, adopted yesterday, and the
                                matter just now submitted, are in conflict, and therefore the
                                present resolution is not in order: and thereupon I, William F.
                                Parrett, appeal to the House from said decision."
                            Mr PARKS. I would inquire whether a similar resolution, submitted
                                yesterday by the gentleman from Johnson and Morgan, (Mr.
                                Dougherty,)reciting the same points was not indefinitely
                                postponed?
                            The SPEAKER. It is not ruled out on that ground.
                            Mr. TURPIE. I second the appeal. I do not see why a direct vote on
                                this resolution should not be in order. It was declared by the
                                resolution of yesterday, that the opinion of the United States
                                Senate in the co-tested election case of the Senators from the State
                                of Indiana was wrong That was the extent clearly of that resolution.
                                As to that, of course, any future consideration of a directly
                                conflicting proposition would be unparliamentary. But the resolution
                                of the gentleman from Warrick takes another step. It does not
                                express an opinion directly adverse, but it takes another step and
                                says, that the election of United States Senators, at the present
                                session, would be unwise, inexpedient, unconstitutional and
                                irregular. It is patent to all, that there are two minorities on
                                this floor: one composed of the representatives of that splendid
                                fossil, the old Whig party; the other is that with which I have the
                                honor to stand. The former made their record yesterday, and now all
                                we ask is, that this expression of our opinion may go upon the
                                record also. It seems to me, that gentlemen might vote for this
                                resolution, and still retain the opinion that the Fitch and Bright
                                election was unconstitutional, and be ready to go into another
                                Senatorial election at the regular session of the Legislature; and
                                it is to that point that I would particularlv direct the attention
                                of the Chair.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I am but little acquainted with parliamentary rules. Like
                                most of us, I am a new member here; and with all due deference to
                                the gentleman, (Mr. Turpie) who is an old member and better
                                acquainted with parliamentary rules, I differ with him on this
                                question. I think the sum and substance ot the resolution come in
                                conflict with the resolution we adopted here yesterday. That is my
                                opinion, and I think the rules preclude the gentleman from offering
                                it. I think the Speaker is right. We have declared here, by vote,
                                that Fitch and Bright are not entitled to their seats as Senators
                                from Indiana. This resolution declares the contrary - that they are
                                entitled to their seats under the decision of the Senate of the
                                United States; and if we adopt this resolution, we of course reverse
                                our decision of yesterday. I would just remark, that if we do not
                                sustain the Chair, we shall find no end to the discussions of these
                                political questions. I had hoped, that when we decided this point
                                yesterday, it was forever put to rest, and that we would not hear
                                the election of these bogus Senators contested here again.
                            Mr. GRIFFIN moved to lay the appeal on the table.
                            The yeas and nays being demanded by Mr. Parrett, were ordered and
                                taken thereon, resulting - yeas 55, nays 39 - as follows:

                                            Speaker - 55.
                                        NAYS - Messrs. Black, Blythe. Bowman, Carr, Clements,

                                            Perry, Stanley, Sullivan, Summers, Tebbs, Thompson of
                                            Madison, Turpie, Usrey, Waterman, Wheeler, Wood -
                                            39.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. DAVIS, when his name was called, said: I think the decision of
                                the Chair is sustained by parliamentary usage, and I shall therefore
                                vote to lay the appeal on the table. At the same time I should like
                                to see my friends on the right have an opportunity of putting
                                themselves on the record as they desire; but the question of order
                                being raised, we must decide it correctly.
                            So the appeal from the decision of the Chair was laid on the
                                table.
                            The House then adjourned till Monday at two o'clock P. M.
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            MONDAY, November 29, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of Saturday was read.
                        
                            REPORT OF SINKING FUND.
                            The PRESIDENT. I will lay before the Senate the report of the
                                Commissioners of the Sinking Fund.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I move that the reading be dispensed with.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            REPORT OF AUDITOR OF STATE.
                            The PRESIDENT. I will lay before the Senate the Annual Report of the
                                Auditor of State. I am requested by him to state that it is but a
                                partial report. It contains matter, however, sufficient to enable
                                Senators to prepare a Revenue bill. The extended report will be
                                reidy and will be laid before the Senate in a short time.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I move that the reading of the report be dispensed with.
                                Every Senator has it upon his table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            The PRESIDENT. I will lay before the Senate a communication from the
                                Treasurer of State in response to a resolution adopted by it:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        OFFICE OF TREASURER OF STATE, INDIANA INDIANAPOLIS,
                                            November 27, 1858.
                                        
                                            Hon. A. A. Hammond, President of the
                                                Senate of Indiana - 
                                        
                                        SIR:In answer to a resolution of your honorable body
                                            concerning the condition of the "school fund" during the
                                            present and past years, I beg leave to submit that the report of the
                                            Auditor of State to the Legislature, which will be
                                            before you in a day or two, contains all the information
                                            you desire on that subject; and the previously submitted
                                            reports of this officer to the Governor and the
                                            Legislature contain the history of his fund during the
                                            time specified in the resolution.

                            Mr. WAGNER. Mr. President, I move that the report be referred to the
                                    Committee on Education.
                            The motion was agreed to.

                                            Hon. A. A. Hammond, President of the

                                        SIR:I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a
                                            resolution of inquiry touching unavailable funds in this

                                            exact justice may be done to all parties concerned, a
                                            committee be raised with power to make a full and fair
                                            investigation of the affairs of this office.
                                        
                                            Very respectfully, Your obedient
                                                servant,
                                            AQUILLA JONES, Treas. of
                                                  State.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            

                            The PRESIDENT, That committee has been appointed.
                            The communication was laid upon the table by consent.
                        
                        
                            REAPPRAISEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.
                            The PRESIDENT. Senate bills Nos. 1, 2 and 23 are made the special
                                order for this hour, and have been referred to a committee of the
                                whole.
                            The Senate resolved itself into a committee of the whole (Mr. Murray
                                in the Chair) and took up the consideration of the bill No. 1,
                                having reference to the appraisement of real estate and making the
                                value thereof uniform throughout the State; when
                            Mr. HEFFREN addressed the committee at length upon the merits of the
                                bill - it having been introduced by him.
                            Mr. GREEN offered an amendment to the first section, which was in
                                fact to strike out the whole bill and insert the law of 1851
                                instead. The amendment proposed by Mr. G. also provides for county
                                appraisers.
                            Mr. LINE spoke in favor of the appointment of township
                                appraisers.
                            Mr. WAGNER was opposed to township appraisers. Some counties are so
                                small that one man could appraise alone, while they may have six or
                                eight townships in them.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS, I offer the following amendment to the amendment:
                            "Strike out the County Assessor clause and insert one Assessor from
                                each Commissioner's district."
                            Mr. SLACK was in favor of the amendment though he did not like the
                                language exactly.
                            The amendment to the amendment was rejected.
                            Mr. SHOEMAKER offered an amendment, proposing that the Board of
                                Commissioners of each county shall appoint a suitable person as
                                appraiser, and that assistants may be appointed not exceeding five
                                in number.
                            The amendment was rejected.
                            Mr. STEELE. I offer the following amendment: Insert the words "not to
                                exceed one in each Commissioner's district." The old law is
                                satisfactory to my people.
                            Mr. MARCH was in favor of leaving this matter to the County
                                Commissioners.
                            Mr. STEELE That is the intention of the amendment; but I will
                                withdraw it, sir.
                            Mr. GOODING. I am in favor of popular sovereignty, and shall propose
                                an amendment at the proper time, that these assessors shall be
                                elected by the people.
                            Mr. CRAVENS. As there seems to be so many systems proposed, I move
                                this committee rise and ask leave to sit again.
                            Mr. BOBBS. I move that they ask to be discharged.
                            The committee agreed to rise and ask to be discharged from the
                                further consideration of this subject.
                            The committee accordingly arose, reported, and the Senate
                                concurred.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I move to take up Senate bill No. 3. [Having reference to
                                the re-appraisement of real estate.]
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I moved all three bills referring to this subject be
                                referred to a select; committee. I now make the same motion I made
                                last week, to refer them to a committee of one from each
                                Congressional District.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. Every Senator knows whether he is in favor of county
                                or township assessors. I prefer that we try this question now. I am
                                opposed to references.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER, I have often seen this kind of discussion upon
                                legislation that is not matured, and I am satisfied that these bills
                                ought to go to a committee, that they may mark out the proper bill
                                that is to come before us.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent, and bills Nos. 1, 3 and 22 were referred to a
                                special com mittee of eleven.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I offer the following instructions: "That they report a
                                bill providing for County Auditors and such assistants as the Board
                                may think necessary."
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. STEVENS. I move that this select committee be instructed to
                                strike out all that requires owners of real estate to swear to the
                                value of their property; and make it the duty ot the County
                                Appraisers to fix the value thereof.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            The PRESIDENT appointed as said select committee, Senators Carnahan,
                                Heffren, Tarkington, O'Brien, March, Jennings, Johnson, Culver,
                                Miller, Hamilton and Green.
                        
                        
                            LEGISLATIVE SENTINEL.
                            Mr. SLACK. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper procure
                                            for the use or the Senate one hundred and fifty copies
                                            of the Legislative Sentinel, now in
                                            course of publication by Messrs. Bingham &
                                            Doughty.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. SLACK. We had copies of the Legislative
                                    Sentinel laid upon our desk on Friday last, and I
                                understand that if five hundred copies are taken, it will be
                                published during the session. I think the Senate should take at
                                least one hundred and fifty copies, three apiece, and the House
                                should subscribe for three apiece.
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    THE LEGISLATIVE SENTINEL.
                    BINGHAM & DOUGHTY, PUBLISHERS.ARIEL & WM. H. DRAPIER,
                        REPORTERS.
                    
                        Vol. I.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, DEC. 2, 1858.
                        No. 7.
                    
                    
                        
                            A VOICE. That would make but four hundred and fifty copies.
                            Mr. SLACK. That would be near enough. These reports are put up in
                                very convenient form for binding, and I think we ought to subscribe
                                for them.
                            Mr. MARCH. I vote against most anything in the way of subscribing for
                                newspapers, but it seems to me very clear that we should subscribe
                                for this. We want it. It gives us a fair view of our proceedings,
                                and is a useful assistance in legislation. I didn't believe this
                                subscribing for newspapers amounts to anything; but I am in favor of
                                subscribing for these reports.
                            Mr. TURNER. I rise for information. There has been a subscription
                                paper circulated amongst us, and I have subscribed on that for these
                                reports. Will that subscription be withdrawn?
                            SEVERAL SENATORS - Yea, yes.
                            Mr. WEIR. I move to amend by striking out "150," and inserting
                                "200."
                            Mr. SLACK. I accept of the amendment.
                            The resolution as amended was adopted.
                        
                        
                            COMMON SCHOOL FUND.
                            Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it is the sense of this
                                            Senate that any bill providing for the disposal and
                                            management of the trust funds set apart by law for
                                            common school purposes in this State, should provide for
                                            equalizing and setting apart to be loaned as other
                                            school funds, on substantial mortgaged securities.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            CLERK FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
                            Mr. MARCH. I offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                                Committee be authorized to employ a Clerk
                                            for such portion of this session as his services are
                                            necessarily required.
                                        The resolution was adopted.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE.
                            Mr. RICE offered a resolution that the Secretary of State be
                                requested to inform the Senate by what authority his predecessor,
                                the late Secretary of State had printed with his annual report for
                                1857, some forty-three pages of general statistical matter; the
                                number of reports so printed; the cost to the State of printing such
                                matter, &c.
                            The resolution was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            SUMS PAID TO ATTORNEY'S IN STATE CASES.
                            Mr. COBB. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Treasurer of State
                                            be and is hereby required to report to the Senate
                                            immediately, the sums of money he has, during his
                                            official term, paid to Attorneys for their services in
                                            the prosecution and defense of suits instituted in
                                            behalf of, and against the State of Indiana; to whom
                                            paid, and the amount each one received, and in what
                                            cases said services were performed, and whether or not
                                            they were the duties imposed by law upon the Attorney
                                            General of said State:
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MARCH. I would like to have him report, also, what duties the
                                Attorney General has discharged, for which he gets his salary.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            ACCOUNTABILITY OF OFFICERS.
                            Mr. STEELE. I offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Finance
                                                Committee be instructed to inquire into
                                            the expediency and necessity of such further legislation
                                            as will effectually secure the rigid accountability of
                                            all officers entrusted with the collection, safe-keeping
                                            and disbursement of the public funds, or with the
                                            custody of State bonds; and which shall render penal the
                                            loaning or misapplication of such funds or bonds, and
                                            which shall protect the State and innocent purchasers
                                            against the fraudulent issue or transfer of certificates
                                            of State stock.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. JENNINGS. I offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the select committee to

                            The SPEAKER. The Chair is constrained to decide the resolution out of
                                order, under the ruling already made.
                            Mr. TURPIE. I submit, that in justice to the Democratic minority on
                                this floor, they should have an opportunity to express their opinion
                                on this question. I hope the House will be unanimous in its consent
                                to allow us a direct vote on this resolution. I am willing to accept
                                the decision of the Chair upon the point of order, but I hope the
                                ruling will be suspended, and that this courtesy will be extended
                                now - now is the accepted time. [Laughter.]

                                gentleman's proposition?
                            Mr. EDWARDS. I object; and I move that the application be laid on the
                                table, and made a special order for to-morrow at two o'clock.
                            Mr. TURPIE. Why not now?
                            Mr. EDWARDS. Because I do not know who are absent or present now,
                                precisely.
                            Mr. TURPIE. I will ask the gentleman from Vigo if he objects?
                            Mr. EDWARDS. I do object at this time.

                                the effect:

                                            of the State, the price paid therefor, and also into the
                                            prices of binding done by him on account of the State;

                            TAX FOR STATE PURPOSES.
                            Mr. EDWARDS submitted a resolution, instructing the
                                    Committee on Ways and Means to the
                                effect:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        That in the opinion of this House, to add anything to the
                                            tax duplicate on assessments of real or other property
                                            for State purposes, for the year 1858, would be
                                            inexpedient, as many have paid or will pay the tax now
                                            charged, before such a law could go into effect: that
                                            such a thing would lead to confusion, because of the
                                            inability of many to pay anything additional before they
                                            can avail themselves of the advantage of the crops of
                                            another year, and because taxation should be equal and
                                            uniform under a reappraisement to be provided for; and
                                            that they should meet the present necessities of the
                                            administration of the State Government, arising out of
                                            casual deficits of the revenue, in consequence of the
                                            last General Assembly failing to pass any law for
                                            revenue, for the years 1857 and 1858; that the means for
                                            that purpose, as well as to pay the interest on the
                                            public debt should be borrowed; and that the money so
                                            borrowed be charged on future tax duplicates, commencing
                                            with the year 1859, &c.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HARNEY. There are important ques tions couched in that
                                resolution, upon which I do not feel ready now to vote. I move that
                                it be postponed and made the special order for tomorrow at 2

                            It was so ordered.

                                        Resolved, That the Auditor of State be
                                            authorized to employ such number of clerks as may be
                                            necessary to enable him to answer promptly the various
                                            resolutions of this House, which have been addressed to
                                            his office.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MURRAY. I move to lay the resolution, on the table.
                            The motion being withdrawn - 
                            Mr. PARRETT referred to the length of time required to go over the
                                business of that office by sundry resolutions adopted in this House,
                                and alleged the impossibility for the Auditor to respond
                                satisfactorily without clerical assistance.
                            Mr. MURRAY renewed the motion to lay the resolution on the table, and
                                it was agreed to on a division - affirmative 38, negative 35.
                            Mr. LAWHEAD submitted a preamble and resolution to the effect,

                                            but Jor what purpose and upon what authority.

                            The SPEAKER (Mr. Edwards in the Chair) now announced the order of

                            Mr. LAWHEAD'S bill (No. 1) providing for the payment of the January

                                passed the second reading - 
                            On motion of Mr. RITTER, it was referred to the Committee on
                                    Ways and Means.

                            Mr. BOYD'S bill (No. 2) to raise revenue for State purposes for the
                                year 1858 was read through and passed the second reading.
                            Mr. BOYD proposed to amend by filling the blank with "fifteen" cents

                            The amendment was agreed to, and the bill referred accordingly.
                        
                        
                            EXEMPTIONS OF CORPORATIONS, &C,
                            Mr. MERRIFIELD'S bill (No. 4) to amend the 445th section of the Act

                                from and after its passage."
                            The amendment was agreed to.
                            On motion by Mr. SCOTT, the bill as amended was referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                        
                            LAW OF DIVORCE.
                            Mr. COLGROVE'S bill (No. 5) to amend the 6th section and repeal the
                                7th clause of the 7th section of the Divorce Act, was read through
                                and passed the second reading.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved to refer the bill to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary.
                            Mr. TURPIE proposed to amend the motion so as to refer the bill to
                                the Committee on the Rights and Privileges of the
                                    Inhabitants of the State of Indiana.
                            After debate upon this motion by Messrs. Colgrove, Turpie, Scott,
                                Parrett, Parks, Murray and Griffin - 
                            Mr. TURPIE'S motion was rejected.
                            Mr. BLYTHE proposed to amend the motion by referring the bill to a
                                select committee of five.
                            The SPEAKER. The first question is on referring to the Standing
                                Committee.
                            The House refused to refer the bill to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary.
                            Mr. BLYTHE'S motion was then agreed to, and the bill was accordingly
                                referred to a select committee.
                            Whereupon the Speaker appointed Messrs Blythe, Davis, Mansfield,
                                Parrett and Brotherton.
                        
                        
                            BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.
                            Mr. DUVAL'S joint resolution relative to the business of the special
                                session, coming up, and being read through by the Clerk
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair regards the resolution as conflicting with the
                                action of the House last Thursday, by which the resolution of the
                                gentleman from Morgan and Johnson (Mr. Dougherty) was indefinitely
                                postponed, and therefore out of order.
                            After debate upon this ruling by Messrs. Davis, Dougherty, Duval and
                                Colgrove, indulged by unanimous consent of the House, without coming
                                to any conclusion
                            The House adjourned.
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            TUESDAY, November, 30, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read.
                        
                            DELINQUENT TAXES - TEN PER CENT. PENALTY
                            Mr. GREEN. I wish to introduce a memorial from the citizens of Tipton
                                and Clinton counties, referring to the ten per cent, penalty on
                                delinquent tax payers. I move it be referred to the
                                    Committee on Finance without reading.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            WATER COURSES PUBLIC HIGHWAYS.
                            Mr. HILL. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Roads be instructed to nquire into the
                                            expediency of declaring water courses public highways,
                                            andm tking it the duty of the Supervisors to keep them
                                            free from obstruction, and report by bill or
                                            otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            ABOLISHING COURT OF COMMON PLEAS.
                            Mr.BENNETT. Mr. President, I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Organization of Courts be
                                            instructed to inquire into the expediency of abolishing
                                            Courts of Common Pleas, increasing the number of Circuit
                                            Judges, holding Circuit Courts three times a year in
                                            each county, increasing the salary of Circuit and
                                            Supreme Judges, increasing the salaries of Prosecuting
                                            Attorneys of Circuit Courts, extending the jurisdiction
                                            of clerks of Circuit Courts in probate, transferring the
                                            business of the Court of Common Pleas to Circuit Courts,
                                            and clerks thereof in vacation, and of a general
                                            revision of the judicial system of the State so as to
                                            render the same more - and economical, and that the
                                            committee report by bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            STATE TAX FOR 1858.
                            Mr. GOODING. I offer the following resolution.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it is inexpedient at
                                            this session of the General Assembly to enact a law
                                            requiring the Auditors of he several counties of this
                                            State, to put upon the tax duplicate a State tax for
                                            collection during the present year.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GOODING. The object of this resolution is this: that if it is
                                adopted it will declare against the collection of taxes now for
                                State purposes;  but of course
                                it will come in order, and have to be collected in subsequent years.
                                Now the people are much oppressed, money is scarce, and it is with
                                great difficulty the people can pay the heavy taxes they are already
                                paying. I simply want a vote of the Senate upon it.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I regard this as a very important proposition, and it
                                ought to be decided by a full Senate. In my county the tax duplicate
                                for this year has been made out, and the collection of a State tax
                                for this year, would cause the additional expense of re vising the
                                duplicates, and we would have to throw away the duplicates we have
                                prepared, and make new ones, which would be attended with a great
                                deal of inconvenience. I understand that money can be borrowed at
                                three or four or five per cent, with which to pay the January and
                                perhaps the July interest upon our State bonds, and a little
                                additional loan will keep the wheels of government in motion. It is
                                good economy to borrow what money may be necessary to meet the
                                exigencies of the State for the present - this is my view, and I
                                think I express the universal sentiment of the people of my
                                district. For these reasons, I am in favor of adopting the
                                resolution of the Senator from Hancock.
                            Mr. SLACK. I am opposed to the adoption of this resolution. We are
                                convened for the purpose of assessing a revenue. A column is already
                                prepared in all the tax duplicates for the purpose of inserting a
                                State taxit can be done in a short time, and at a small expense; and
                                the people expect this Legislature to assess a tax upon them. I am
                                in favor of a light tax. I don't want it to be neglected until
                                another year or two rolls around, and then treble it.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I do think that we ought to lay a tax for 1858. It is
                                as the Senator trom Huntington says, there are blank columns in the
                                tax duplicate for the purpose of inserting a State tax. If the
                                officers can collect a tax for county purposes, of course they can
                                for State purposes. The average tax for county purposes is
                                eighty-three cents on the hundred dollars, while the State tax is
                                only twenty-two cents - twenty cents to pay the expenses of the
                                Government, and two cents for the Sinking Fund. There may be one
                                difficulty with those individuals who have already paid their taxes
                                for the year, there may be some difficulty in collecting the State
                                tax that may be imposed by this Legislature, from them. It may cause
                                some grumbling among this portion, but I apprehend there are not
                                many of them.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. Senators have well said this is an important
                                question. I consider it a very important one, and one upon which we
                                ought to act. To my mind it is a sad commentary upon the financial
                                skill of Indiana, that she should steadily increase her State debt,
                                instead of diminishing it. We find no taxes levied for 1857, and
                                none for 1858, and unless the tax is levied she will still increase
                                her indebtedness. There is general prosperity throughout the State
                                now, and there is no reason why her indebtedness should be
                                increased. It is intended to be the policy to diminish it, but it
                                appears not to have been the policy for the past two years. The
                                People expect this Legislature to levy a tax for 1858, and when we
                                were called together it was generally known that this was one of the
                                principal purposes for which we were convened. As far as my
                                constituents are concerned they did not complain, but expect this
                                tax to be levied. With these views I have an amendment to offer.
                                Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the
                                following:
                            That this Senate is in favor of levying a sufficient amount of tax
                                for the year A.D. 1858, to pay the interest on the State debt, and
                                keep up the expenses of the State Government for said year.
                            Mr. BENNETT. I concur with the Senator from Adams that this is the
                                most important subject upon which we are called together to act, but
                                I am not prepared to vote upon this question now. I move to postpone
                                it until next Thursday at half-past two o'clock. I think we ought to
                                take time to consider about it it is too important to pass over
                                lightly.Mr. GOODING made some further remarks explanatory of his
                                resolution.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS was opposed to postponing the subject. The people expect
                                to pay a State tax for this year. In 1843 and 1844, when property
                                was selling for little or nothing when we sold pork for two dollars
                                and a half per hundred we paid State taxes higher than we ask the
                                people to do now, and why should they complain when we have seven
                                dollars a hundred for our pork?
                            Mr. HEFFREN spoke in favor of the resolution. He was opposed to the
                                postponement of the subject.
                            Mr. STEVENS introduced a similar resolution the other morning. He was
                                strongly in favor of the proposition then, and is more so now.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON was opposed to postponement.
                            The question was further debated by Senators Anthony, Line and
                                Murray, when Mr. RICE moved as an amendment to the amendment, the
                                following:
                            That the Committee on Finance be instructed to
                                inquire into the expediency of raising revenue by taxation for the
                                current year, and report by bill or otherwise.
                            Further debate was indulged in by Senators Steele, Bobbs, and
                                Hamilton, when - 
                            Mr. ANTHONY moved that the resolution and amendments be laid upon the
                                table until Friday next, and that they be made the special order for
                                2 1/2 o'clock.
                            Mr. BENNETT. I have a motion before the Senate to postpone until
                                Thursday.
                            Mr. ANTHONY. I would suggest to the Senator to make it Wednesday.
                            Mr. BENNETT. I accept.
                            Senators Green, Weir, Cravens, Cooper, Beeson, March, Brown,
                                Robinson, Jones, Turner, Kinley, and Conner continued the discussion
                                of the subject.
                            The question recurring upon the postponement until to-morrow at 2 1/2
                                o'clock: the yeas and nays were demanded by Senators Weir and
                                Heffren, and being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 12, nays
                                34.
                            So the subject was not postponed.
                            Mr. MARCH. I move that the resolution and amendments lay upon the
                                table.
                            The yeas and nays were demanded by Senators Williams and Grooding, and being
                                ordered and taken resulted, yeas 29, nays 17.
                            So the motion was agreed to, and the resolution and amendments lie
                                upon the table.
                        
                        
                            DEFICIT IN THE REVENUE.
                            Mr. MARCH. By leave of the Senate I ask to introduce the following
                                resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Treasurer of State
                                            report to the Senate at the earliest moment practicable,
                                            the amount of money required to meet the present deficit
                                            in the revenues of the State, and the wants of the
                                            coming year; whether the same can be borrowed, and if
                                            so, from what source and upon what terms.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                            And then the Senate took a recess till two o'clock P.M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President: I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Superintendent of
                                            Public Instruction be requested to inform the Senate
                                            whether one township library has been distributed to the
                                            Directors of the State Prison for the use of the
                                            convicts thereof, in compliance with the 20th section of
                                            an act entitled an Act to provide for the government and
                                            discipline of the State Prison, and to repeal an Act to
                                            provide for the government and discipline of the State
                                            Prison, approved March 3d, 1855, and all other laws or
                                            parts of laws, inconsistent herewith, approved February
                                            5th, 1857, if not, the reason why said library was not
                                            thus distributed.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.

                            
                                DIVORCES.
                                Mr. CONNER. If the Senate will consent I would like to have the
                                    order of business suspended so that we can take up bill No. 39
                                    with regard to the Divorce law.
                                This bill was read through the second time by the Secretary.
                                Mr. CONNER. I move that the bill be referred to the select
                                    committee of five to which the other bill upon this same subject
                                    was referred.
                                Mr. WEIR. I move to instruct the committee to amend by striking
                                    out the word "two" whereever it occurs before the word "year,"
                                    and insert instead the word, "one;" and to strike out the
                                    emergency clause.
                                Mr. MARCH. I ask for a division of the question.
                                The question being, first, upon instructing the committee to
                                    strike out "two" and insert "one."
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                The question then being upon instructing the committee to strike
                                    out the emergency clause in the bill: Senators March, McLean and
                                    Conner made a few remarks, when
                                Mr. MURRAY offered the following additional instructions: "To
                                    strike out the clause 'saving cases pending at the passage of
                                    this act'."
                                This motion was debated by Senators Murray, Weir, March, and
                                    Cravens, when - 
                                Mr. McLEAN moved to lay it upon the table.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr. MURRAY. I offer the following additional instructions:
                                Further instruct the committee to inquire into the
                                    constitutionality of the 12th section of the Divorce act.
                                The question being upon instructing the committee to strike out
                                    the emergency clause - the motion was rejected.
                                The question then being upon Mr.Murray'S instructions just
                                    submitted - 
                                The motion was agreed to and the committee were so
                                    instructed.
                            
                            
                                POSTAGE ON DOCUMENTS.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. I offer the following
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper find
                                                the amount of postage on each of the reports of tbe
                                                State officers of 1857 and'58, together with the
                                                reports of the Superintendent of the Hospitals, and
                                                post the same up in the folding-room for the

                                The resolution was agreed to by consent.

                                            Resolved, That the Door-keeper be

                                Mr. SLACK. I move to amend by inserting "whisky."
                                The PRESIDENT. Reduce your amendment to writing.

                                The resolution was rejected.

                                Mr. CONLEY. I offer the following resolution:

                                Mr. RICE. I offer the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the
                                                  Committee on Finance be
                                                authorized to employ a clerk for such time as said
                                                committee may deem necessary.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. STEELE. I move to amend by adding that the Committee
                                        on Banks and Corporations be authorized to employ
                                    a clerk.
                                Mr. GREEN. I offer the following as an amendment to the
                                    amendment:
                                That the Committee on Swamp Lands be authorized to employ a clerk
                                    for such time as his services may be needed.
                                
                                Mr. GOODING. I desire that the Committee on
                                        Temperance should have a clerk.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. It seems we might as well appoint a clerk for every
                                    one of the committees.
                                The motion made by Senator Gooding was rejected.
                                Mr. HEFFREN wished to amend by adding "and that the chairman of
                                    such committee shall report the name of the employee to the
                                    Senate and the number of days the said clerk has been employed
                                    by said committee.
                                Mr. STEELE. I withdraw my amendment, sir
                                Mr. BENNETT. I offer the following, as an amendment. [Strike out
                                    all alter the resolving clause, and insert]
                                "That no commitee shall be allowed a clerk, except on the written
                                    request of the chairman of said committee, and that the said
                                    clerk shall be paid but for so many days as the chairman shall
                                    certify in writing the days he was so employed."
                                The amendment was agreed to, and the resolution, as amended, was
                                    adopted.

                            ABSENCE.
                            On motion of Mr. SUMMERS, Mr. Dobbins had leave of absence on account
                                of ill health.
                        
                        
                            STATE DEBT.
                            Mr. BAIRD, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                reported back Mr. Lawhead's bill (H. R. 1) to provide for the
                                January instalment of interest on the public debt, with a
                                recommendation that the same be referred to the Committee
                                    on the Sinking Fund.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            LICENSE LAW.
                            Mr. DURHAM submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Temperance be instructed to inquire
                                            into the expediency of adopting the License system for
                                            the regulation of the liquor traffic, and appropriating
                                            the money arising therefrom to the support  of common schools; and
                                            also to protect the community from the disorderly
                                            condnct of drunkards; and that they report by bill or
                                            otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MURRAY submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Temperance be instructed to inquire
                                            into the expediency of reporting a bill for the repeal
                                            of the Prohibitory Liquor Law of 1855, and the enactment
                                            of a law on that subject which will not be liable to the
                                            objections urged by the Supreme Court against the law
                                            aforesaid.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            PUBLIC PRINTING.
                            Mr. KEEFER submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That in the opinion of this
                                            House the State printing should be let out to the lowest
                                            bidder, and that the Committee on Public
                                                Expenditures be instructed to inquire into
                                            the expediency, and report a bill to that effect at as
                                            early a period as possible.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MURRAY. That is an imperative resolution. I do not think the
                                House is prepared now to act on the subject. There was a special
                                committee raised yesterday to inquire into this printing. He wanted
                                the facts before he acted, and therefore moved to lay the resolution
                                on the table for the present.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            STATE PRISON.
                            Mr. SCOTT submitted the following, which was adopted by consent:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That an addition of two
                                            members be made to the Committee on the Affairs
                                                of the State Prison.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            LEGISLATIVE SENTINEL.
                            Mr. CARR submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                            instructed to procure two hundred copies of the Legislative Sentinel for the use of
                                            members of this House.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. NEBEKER of Warren. I move to lay the resolution on the table.
                            Mr. PROSSER and Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren, demanded the yeas and nays,
                                and they were ordered.
                            Mr, MURRAY. I would like to see that publication encouraged.
                            The SPEAKER. Debate is not in order.
                            The question on the motion to lay the resolution on the table was now
                                taken, resulting - yeas 42, nays 52, as follows:

                                        NAYS - Messrs. Baird, Black, Blythe, Bowman, Carr, Clark,

                                            - 52.
                                    
                                
                            
                            So the resolution was not laid on the table.
                            Mr. BOYD. I propose to amend by adding in the proper place:
                            "Provided that each member pay for his proportion of the same out of
                                his own pocket."
                            Mr. POWER. I would like to know, if that amendment pass, whether it
                                would be obligatory?
                            Mr. BOYD. It is not. I would speak for myself. I am in favor of
                                taking this paper and paying for it out of my own pocket.
                            On motion by Mr. PARKS, the amendment was laid on the table.
                                Affirmative 43, negative 30.
                            The question recurring on the adoption of the resolution - 
                            Messrs. RITTER and HAMILTON of Boone, demanded the yeas and nays, and
                                they were ordered.
                            Mr, MURRAY. I would like to see this publicarion encouraged, from the
                                fact that it does contain full and correct reports of our
                                proceedings - more so than were ever given heretofore, to my
                                knowledge, in this Capitol; but I would prefer to sustain the
                                publication by private subscription, if we could get at it. But as
                                that proposition has been voted down, and the indication is to pass
                                the resolution, I move to strike out and insert one hundred
                                copies.
                            Mr. USREY moved to refer the resolution and amendment to the
                                    Committee on Stationery.
                            Mr. PROSSER. I think we ought to come to a direct vote. With respect
                                to this paper we shall have to subscrib something to maintain it,
                                either out of our own pockets or from the Treasury. I understand the
                                Senate has authorized 200 copies, and we certainly can take that
                                number. These reports make a very nice, convenient thing for future
                                reference to look back and see what has been done here. Nothing has
                                ever been furnished here to equal it. I am opposed to the reference.
                                There is no use in wasting time in that way over such a
                                proposition.
                            Mr. DAVIS. I have no desire to squander public funds by taking
                                papers, and I would not think it extravagant to take this. For, if
                                it is to be kept up in good faith, it will be an important document
                                for reference to those who sent us here. Again, our rules admit of
                                the explanation of a vote in very brief terms on the yeas and nays,
                                and these reasons given by those who vote here, preserved in this
                                shape, will probably some time become very important. Those
                                gentlemen who feel very sensitive about taking money out of the
                                Treasury for this, can very easily go to the Treasury and pay in the
                                amount of the jost of the copies they receive. I would suggest to my
                                friend from Lawrence that he and I could go and deposit that
                                amount.
                            Mr. HALL, of Grant. Do we get the back numbers?
                            The SPEAKER supposed that was understood.Mr Usrey's motion to refer
                                was rejected, and the question recurred on Mr. Murray's
                                amendment.
                            Mr. RITTER. I know the State of Indiana is a great State, and we are
                                a great and flourishing people, but it is rather a new step for us
                                to assume the functions and dignity of the Congress of the United
                                States by authorizing reports in the form of this resolution. I have
                                no objections, and I think every member, if he feel sufficiently
                                interested, ought to take a number of this Sentinel. But the question is, whom does it interest?
                                Those who have their names printed in it. It is interesting only to
                                ourselves; and if we desire to gratify our pride in this respect so
                                much as to have these numbers, it seems to me that it meet that we
                                should pay for them out of our

                            own pockets. As to the record of reasons assigned for a vote, they
                                are spread upon the journal. I can bear testimony to the general
                                accuracy of these reports; but if we take this Legislative Sentinel, the precedent will run through time,
                                accumulate in expensiveness, and draw off thousands and thousands of
                                dollars by the hands of every Legislature
                            Mr. POWER. I shall support the amendment of the gentleman from
                                Elkhart, for the reason that I labored here very hard to get three
                                dollars' worth of postage stamps, and had to put upwith two dollars'
                                worth. I want to get back that dollar.
                            Mr. HAMILTON opposed the whole thing. No valid reason had been
                                offered for the proposition, and he hoped it would not prevail.
                            Mr. MURRAY'S amendment was rejected, and the question recurred on the
                                adoption of the resolution.
                            Mr. HUNTER and Mr. MURRAY demanded the yeas and nays, which being
                                ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 44, nays 44 - as follows:

                            Mr. JEFFRIES submitted the following, which was adopted.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the committee
                                                on Education be instructed to inquire into
                                            the expediency of distributing the taxes collected for
                                            school purposes in the counties where collected, and
                                            report by bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. SHULL submitted the following, which was adopted.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That sound policy dictates
                                            that an act providing for the disposal and management of
                                            the trust funds set apart for common school purposes,
                                            should provide for the distribution of said fund amongst
                                            the several counties of this State, according to the
                                            number of children in each; and inasmuch as the interest
                                            only of said fund can be used for the support of common
                                            schools, its investment in such securities or in such
                                            way as to secure promptly the interest thereon, is of
                                            the highest consideration.

                            Mr. TURPIE submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS, Great loss and inconvenience have been felt by
                                            the several counties by reason of the law now in force
                                            for assessing the property of railroad companies doing
                                            business therein: therefore,
                                        Be it Resolved, That the
                                                Committee on Ways and Means be
                                            and they are hereby instructed to inquire into the
                                            expediency of so amending the present law as to provide
                                            that the real and personal property belonging to
                                            railroads be assessed and listed for taxation in the
                                            county where the same may be situate, and not in the
                                            county of the principal office.

                            Mr. MERRIFIELD submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Judiciary be instructed to inquire
                                            into the expediency of repealing so much of the 36th
                                            section of the act establishing the Court of Common
                                            Pleas, defining its jurisdiction, duties, &c, as
                                            provides for the taxing of a docket fee against the
                                            losing party in civil cases.

                            STATE INDEBTEDNESS
                            Mr. HUNTER submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Auditor of State
                                            furnish this House immediately with the entire
                                            indebtedness of the State other than the foreign State
                                            debt, stating particularly to what persons or
                                            corporations or funds it is indebted, and the amount of
                                            interest it is paying to each.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HARNEY thought the Auditor's statements submitted yesterday
                                sufficiently satisfactory on that subject.
                            Mr. HUNTER. The Committee on Ways and Means desire
                                to set forth the entire indebtedness of the State. We have carefully
                                looked over the Auditor's report, and are satisfied that it does not
                                furnish the entire amount. It says nothing about the amount due the
                                Sinking Fund. In fact there are some of the trust funds of which it
                                states the gross amount. We want exact, specific amounts, or as
                                nearly so as may be: and if the Auditor's report be correct, it will
                                not take long to answer that resolution. We want the Auditor to
                                furnish the amount of indebtedness and the amount of interest the
                                State is paying.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            ROAD LAW.
                            Mr. TREADWAY submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Roads be instructed to inquire into the
                                            expediency of so amending the present Road law as to
                                            dispense with the working out of personal privileges,
                                            and substituting one dollar, to be paid by such persons
                                            as are liable to work privileges, to the Supervisor to
                                            be expended as the law may provide; and that said
                                            committee report by bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was rejected.
                        
                        
                            LEGISLATIVE SENTINEL.
                            Mr. USREY. Mr. Speaker, I move a reconsideration of the vote on the
                                adoption of the resolution of the gentleman from Clark in regard to
                                taking the Legislative Sentinel.
                            Mr. GIFFORD. I am in favor of taking this Sentinel,
                                and though I have voted against taking it here, I am anxious that it
                                should be taken by individual subscription. I think members can well
                                afford to subscribe to the extent indicated in the resolution. If it is only for the
                                benefit of members, we ought not to tax the State for our individual
                                benefit. If it was a thing to benefit our constituents, it would be
                                proper to make the subscription proposed. I think we ought to
                                subscribe as individuals. I am willing to take two copies, or as
                                many for my share as will justify the publication.
                            The motion to reconsider was agreed to on a division - affirmative
                                51, negative not counted and the question recurred on the adoption
                                of the resolution.
                            The yeas and nays being again demanded, ordered and taken thereon,
                                resulted - yeas 51, nays 44 - as follows:

                            TRUSTEES OF CARLISLE.
                            Mr. USREY asked and obtained a suspension of the order of business,
                                to enable him to submit a petition from the trustees of the town of
                                Carlisle, in the county of Sullivan, asking the General Assembly to
                                authorize their act in levying and collecting a school tax.
                            The petition was referred to the Committee on
                                    Education.
                        
                        
                            TOWNSHIP BUSINESS.
                            Mr. COLGROVE submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on County and Township Business be
                                            instructed to inquire into the expediency of abolishing
                                            the present mode of doing township business, and provide
                                            for a less expensive mode of dcing the same, and that
                                            they report by bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.
                            Mr. MURRAY submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That this House will proceed
                                            to the consideration of all business in its regular
                                            order - the filling of all offices to be filled by
                                            election of the Legislature included - until all the
                                            questions of public policy recommended by the Governor
                                            shall have been considered and decided, and then adjourn
                                            the session.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY submitted whether the resolution was not out of order
                                under the ruling of the Chair.
                            The SPEAKER. I decide now that the Chair was out of order in the
                                ruling against both the resolutions last week, to which the
                                gentleman refers. The present decision of the Chair is based on
                                section 35 of Jefferson's Manual (which the Speaker read.) The Chair
                                entertains the resolution of the gentleman from Elkhart.
                            Mr. COLGROVE proposed to amend by striking from the resolution all
                                after the word "order."
                            Mr. MURRAY considered the amendment designed to destroy the
                                resolution. He was opposed to the idea of sitting forty days, and
                                also to confining the business of the session to the subjects
                                recommended by the Governor. He would put all into the hopper, and
                                when they were ground out, he would shut down the gate and go
                                home.
                            Mr. COLGROVE. The election of these officers was an important duty
                                owing to our constituents, and he was in favor of making elections
                                whenever we get ready to do itwhenever the proper arrangements are
                                made when all parties here may be fully represented. He was
                                especially in favor of electing officers to the places of those who
                                have been so long holding by the grace of the Governor. The
                                provisions of the resolution were premature. He had submitted the
                                amendment in good faith.
                            Mr. CAVINS made an ineffectual motion lay the amendment on the
                                table.
                            Mr. DAVIS spoke to the importance of stability in our legislation,
                                and the importance of being careful about making changes in the
                                laws. To adopt the amendment would be to vote the session shall be
                                continued forty days. He admitted certain necessary modifications of
                                the code of 1852, to suit judicial decisions under it. Under the
                                original resolution we would go on with the ordinary business until
                                the proposition from the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means shall be fully matured. What was to be
                                understood by the word "arrangement" in the remarks or the gentlemen
                                from Randolph? He neither understood nor sympathized with
                                arrangements for party drill in the matter of elections here. If he
                                were a party leader he would urge his brethren to make a short
                                session, and he considered course also for the best interest of the
                                State, hoped this resolution would pass, and that should go on
                                regularly with the business, elections also, &c., and that the
                                amendment would be voted down.
                            Mr. COLGROVE replied to Mr. Davis. demanded the yeas and nays on the
                                amendment.
                            Mr. TURPIE gave his views of the proper business that should be
                                considered at this extra session. He was glad to see this
                                disposition to reconsider the action already taken, and hoped that
                                general subjects of legislation at this session would be avoided,
                                and that all such business would go over to the regular session, as
                                the Constitution provides. The people did not expect general
                                legislation, and the dearth of petitions and memorials indicated
                                this. He reviewed and replied to the arguments for going into
                                general business and the election of officers.
                            Mr. BRANHAM also addressed the House at length, insisting that a loan
                                was necessary to meet the interest of the State debt, because it
                                could not be raised in time by a tax levy, neither could that tax be
                                collected so soon without manifest inequality and injustice. All
                                these resolutions had no other effect than to interrupt
                                investigation in the committees. The filling of the offices was a
                                small consideration by the side of these financial considerations.
                                It was the dictate of good policy to remain in session till we can
                                indicate what is the temper of the House with regard to the Court of
                                Common Pleas, the  present
                                cumbrous township business, the mananagement of the Penitentiary,
                                and the facts connected with the same, the management of the several
                                Benevolent Institutions of the State, and then adjourn and go home,
                                that propositions on these may be matured at once in the regular
                                session. The Committee on Ways and Means did not
                                intend to go out to borrow money before they were ready to tell the
                                world how and when it should be paid.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY supported the resolution and opposed the amendment. At
                                the proper time he would move to strike out what relates to
                                elections, but still, if he did not succeed, he should vote for it.
                                He exulted in the prospect of the adoption of this resolution. The
                                only difference between this, and his resolution, offered last
                                Friday was the election of officers. He reviewed the arguments
                                againts his resolution, &c.
                            Mr. SCOTT regretted the introduction of the resolutions, and opposed
                                all such propositions as indirectly reflecting on the intelligence,
                                if not the integrity of this body. Too early a day for adjournment
                                could not be set to suit him, and he replied at length to those of
                                the other part.
                            Mr. RITTER gave sundry suggestions against the wisdom of dsscussing
                                such resolutions as this. They could have no binding force.
                            Mr. MELLETT gave his voice against this debate, but reasoned in favor
                                of the amendment. Still, he must not be taken as favoring a long
                                session. A long session was against his sense of duty as well as
                                considerations of private advantage. He scouted all considerations
                                of a partisan or a mere popular character in connection with those
                                of duty here. He also reviewed the arguments favoring the least
                                amount of legislation, but seeing no reason why the business before
                                us could not be done now as well as at any other time, &c. He
                                would act speedily, but intelligently.
                            Mr.SPEAKER GORDON (Mr. Colgrove in the Chair) gave an explanation
                                with reference to remarks made by the gentleman from White, and the
                                gentleman from Johnson and Morgan, justifying his resolutions of
                                inquiry into alleged abuses, &c.
                            Mr. MURRAY also explained, maintaining and defending his course.
                            Without coming to any conclusion
                            The House took a recess till two o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The SPEAKER directed the consideration of the special order, viz: the
                                consideration of Mr. Edward's resolution submitted yesterday:
                            
                                STATE LOAN.
                                The resolution was read through again by the Clerk, and it is as
                                    follows:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the
                                                  Committee on Ways and Means are
                                                hereby instructed, that in the opinion of this
                                                House, the levying of a tax to be added to the tax
                                                duplicate on the assessment and valuation of real
                                                property for taxation for state purposes, would be
                                                inexpedient, as many persons have now paid and
                                                others will pay the taxes as now charged, before the
                                                act making such additions can go into effect; that
                                                it will leal to confusion, cause delinquencies
                                                because of the inability of tax-payers to meet any
                                                additional assessment until they can have the
                                                advantage of the products of another year; that the
                                                value of real property has materially changed, and
                                                to cause the rate of assessment and taxation to be
                                                equal and uniform, a reappraisement of all real and
                                                personal property should be provided for and made;
                                                that to meet the present necessities for the
                                                administration of the State Government, arising out
                                                of the casual defects in the revenue in consequence
                                                of the last General Assembly failing ta pass any law
                                                for the purpose of raising a revenue for toe years
                                                1857 and 1858; that the means for that purpose, as
                                                well as to pay the interest on the public debt
                                                should bs borrowed, aad that the monies so borrowed
                                                should be collected by being divided and charged
                                                upon future tax duplicates commencing with the year
                                                1859, and when so collected should be paid to the
                                                proper parties.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. HARNEY wanted the action of the House on the resolution, for
                                    a guide of the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                    although he himself should not vote for it. He proceeded to
                                    reason against an increase of the public debt, without providing
                                    means to pay it. Such a course of policy could not fail to
                                    injuriously affect our State credit. We had already exhausted
                                    $559,000 of these trust funds! and for the present year and the
                                    next year it would require a like sum, and there was danger of
                                    the exhaustion of these funds, which was too sacred almost to
                                    disturb at all for the ordinary expenses of the government. It
                                    was singular that the State Bank should have been more careful
                                    of the Sinking Fund than the State itself. This proposition, if
                                    adopted, would lead to a new State indebtedness of more than two
                                    millions of dollars. He showed from the 12th page of the report
                                    of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, that provision for the
                                    repayment of these funds thus used, was expected to be made, and
                                    if it were not done, we would go into market with a bad grace,
                                    with a domestic debt which we have not yet provided for.
                                Mr. AUSTIN moved to postpone the consideration of the subject
                                    till Thursday 2 o'clock P. M.
                                Mr. MURRAY proposed to amend the motion by substituting a
                                    reference to the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                    with instructions to report whether there are any funds
                                    belonging to the State which can be made available for the State
                                    expenses of 1857-8, and the interest on the State debt.
                                The first question being on the postponement, it was agreed
                                    to.
                            
                            
                                ORDER OF BUSINESS.
                                The SPEAKER announced the consideration of the unfinished
                                    business of the morning, viz: Mr. Murray's resolution - the
                                    question being on Mr. Colgrove's amendment to strike out all
                                    after the word "order."
                                Mr. SCOTT moved to lay the resolution and amendment on the
                                    table.
                                Messrs. DAVIS and SCOTT demanded the yeas and nays, and they were
                                    ordered and taken, resulting - yeas 42, nays 49, so the House
                                    refused to lay on the table, and the question recurred on the
                                    amendment.
                                Mr. HUNTER spoke to the whole argument involved in this subject -
                                    stating particularly important subjects of legislation, and the
                                    necessity of attending to them promptly; and the neces sity of
                                    carrying the present organization into the regular session in
                                    order to economise time and labor in the standing committees.
                                    When he had concluded,
                                Mr. COLGROVE moved indefinite postponement of the subject.
                                
                                Messrs. SCOTT and PROSSER demanded the yeas and nays, and the
                                    same were ordered.
                                Mr. DAVIS said, (explaining,) that in giving this vote now, he
                                    did so with no disposition to disturb the organization of the
                                    House. Let the committees go on - sit in the vacation - but an
                                    forty days' session now was out of the question.
                                Mr. AUSTIN explained, that he must vote in favor of postponement
                                    to quiet this subject, which had occupied too much time.
                                Mr. RYNEARSON explained, that in view of the necessity of
                                    attending to pressing business indicated, he could not vote to
                                    postpone. He also desired a short session.
                                Mr. POWER also spoke briefly, regarding the whole proceeding on
                                    this subject as ridiculous and farcical. He desired its
                                    effectual quiet - its indefinite postponement and burial so deep
                                    that gentlemen can never raise it again.
                                The yeas and nays were taken, resulting - yeas 51, nays 43 - as
                                    follows:

                                    of the United States Senate on this subject, and declaring it
                                    inexpedient to go into any election of Senators at this

                                            sum of $186,861 64, which is now due from the State
                                            Treasury to said fund, and also in the further sum of
                                            $145,410 57 to the Swamp Land Fund; and whereas, in
                                            justice to those that purchased swamp lands with the
                                            expectation that the same would be drained, and also
                                            with a proper regard for the educational interests of
                                            the State, said sums ought to be speedily reimbursed,
                                            therefore the Committee on Finance
                                            are instructed to inquire into the expediency of paying
                                            said sums, and report as soon as practicable.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.

                                from Ripley:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Ways and Means be instructed to inquire
                                            into and ascertain the amount of available funds, if
                                            any, that may be applied to meet the deficit of 1857 and
                                            1858, and report accordingly, at their earliest
                                            convenience.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. McLEAN. I move that the Messenger of the Senate take it to the
                                other end of the Capitol.
                            A VOICE. There is no Committee on Ways and Means
                                in the Senate.
                            Mr. FISK. I desire that the resolution shall be so changed as to read
                                    "Committee on Finance."
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.

                            The PRESIDENT. The following resolution is offered by the Senator
                                from Marshall:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the State Prison be instructed to
                                            inquire into the expediency and propriety of
                                            establishing a house of refuge at in county, in the
                                            northern part of this State, for the confinement of
                                            juvenile offenders, and all those that have committed
                                            larceny, and report by bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The report was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            CONVICTS TO THE PENITENTIARY.
                            Mr. CONNER. Mr. President.
                            The PRESIDENT. The following resolution is offered by the Senator
                                from Wabash.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS, heretofore, when more than one prisoner has been
                                            convicted to the State Prison at the same term by the
                                            several Circuit Courts of this State, some of the
                                            Sheriff's of the several counties of the State in such
                                            cases, have been in the practice of conveying such
                                            prisoners to the State prison, one at a time, and
                                            charging mileage for conveying each several prisoner;
                                            therefore,
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the State Prison be instructed to
                                            report a bill requiring all the prisoners convicted at
                                            the same term to be conveyed to the State Prison at one
                                            time, or otherwise be prohibited from charging miles for
                                            more than one visit.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            CLERK TO THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE.
                            Mr. RICE. Mr. President. I beg leave to submitted the following:
                            Mr. PRESIDENT, In pursuance of a Resolution of the Senate, the
                                undersigned, as Chairman of the committee on Finance, asks leave of
                                the Senate for said committee to employ a Clerk for such time as
                                said committee may deem necessary.
                            J. A. RICE, Chairman.
                            To which the Senate consented.
                        
                        
                            TOWNSHIP TRUSTEES MEETING.
                            Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President.
                            The PRESIDENT. The following resolution is offered by the Senator
                                from Decatur:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on County and Township Business be
                                            requested to inquire into the expediency of so changing
                                            the law regulating the meeting of Township Trustees so
                                            as to have them meet only once in three months, and to
                                            give notice of the time of their meeting, in the
                                            newspaper having the largest circulation in the
                                            county.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. STEVENS. It is a mere resolution of inquiry; no harm can be done
                                by its adoption
                            Mr. WEIR. Mr. President, I object to the passage of this resolution,
                                and the reason I object is this. It seems to be agreed that the
                                present mode of doing township business shall be changed, and that
                                being the case we do away entirely with the present system, and
                                consequently there is no use of adopting forty resolutions of this
                                character, calling upon the committee to act in this respect. There
                                will be no end to expressions of this character, therefore I object.
                                I move to lay the resoluton on the table.
                            
                            Upon a division of the Senate the motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            OPENING OF NEW ROADS.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Mr President.
                            The PRESIDENT. The following resolution is offered by the Senator
                                from Washington:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on County and Township Business be
                                            requested to inquire into the expediency of so amending
                                            the present Road law as to piy for the expenses of
                                            opening new roads, out of the Township Treasury, and
                                            report by bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            ABOLISHING TOWNSHIP LIBRARIES.
                            Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President.
                            The PRESIDENT. The following resolution is offered by the Senator
                                from Union:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That as the present system of
                                            Township Libraries has failed to accomplish the purposes
                                            for which it was designed, and is a heavy unnecessary
                                            expense to the people of the State, that the
                                                Committee on Finance be
                                            instructed to inquire into the expediency of abolishing
                                            or revising the same.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. RICE. This resolution assumes what I think is not true. I take it
                                upon myself to say here, and I think Senators will bear me out in
                                the assertion, that these township libraries have done a great deal
                                of good. If the question should come up here as to voting for a tax
                                to increase these libraries, that would be another question. I will
                                vote against the resolution.
                            The resoluion was rejected.
                        
                        
                            BILLS ON THE SECOND READING.
                            Mr. McLEAN. Mr. President: If in order, sir, I will move to suspend
                                the order of business, and take up the order of the day - being
                                bills upon their second reading. The Senate will remember that there
                                are some forty odd bills now on their second reading. We have been
                                in session nine or ten days and done nothing. I think these bills
                                ought to be taken up, and some substantial legislation be done.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
                            Mr. WEIR. Mr. President: Owing to sickness in my family, I desire the
                                Senate's consent to be absent for a few days. I will further state
                                that I have made an arrangement with the Senator from Allen (Mr.
                                Hamilton) to pair off with him upon political questions. I will also
                                state that the Senator from Allen is in poor health and he may
                                desire to go home; I don't know how that will be.
                            Mr. McLEAN. I move that the Senator from Allen be excused until
                                Tuesday.
                            Mr. CRAVENS. I was requested by the Senator from Monroe (Mr. Wagner,)
                                to ask leave of absence for him - he could not get the floor in time
                                to ask for himself.
                            Leave of absence was granted in these three cases by unanimous
                                consent.
                        
                        
                            MODE OF CHANGING VENUE IN CIVIL CASES.
                            Mr. Heffren's bill (No. 7) authorizing a mode of taking a change of
                                venue, in certain civil cases not now provided for by law, was about
                                to be read by the Secretary, who was stopped by - 
                            Mr. HEFFREN. That bill is upon the table now.
                            [This was found to be the case; the Secretary had made a mistake;
                                and, of course rectified it.
                        
                        
                            VENTILATING AND WARMING COUNTY PRISONS.
                            Mr. Heffren's bill (No. 11) in
                                relation to the ventillating and warming of county prisons, was read
                                through a second time by the Secretary.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I move that this bill be referred to the
                                    Committee on County and Township
                                Business.
                            Mr. GREEN. I do not see much need of referring it again, It is a
                                simple bill providing that it shall be the business of the Board of
                                County Commissioners to make repairs and fix the prisons right. I
                                don't see how it can be bettered it is a simple proposition. It is
                                delaying business very much to refer a bill to a committee unless it
                                has need of revision. I am in favor of the bill, and I should like
                                to take a vote upon it now.
                            The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time to
                                morrow.
                        
                        
                            PROHIBITING UNSAFE PAPER CURRENCY.
                            Mr. Tarkington's bill (No. 12) prohibiting safe paper currency, was
                                read through the second time by the Secretary.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I move that the bill be referred to the
                                    Committee on Banks.
                            The bill was so referred by consent.
                            Mr. GREEN. I ask to instruct the committee to strike out the
                                emergency clause. We find it in almost every bill, and is a great
                                expense.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON. I think there is morel need of an emergency clause in
                                this bill than in any other that may come up here. I hope we will
                                shut the door down upon such trash immediately and that it will pass
                                with the emergency clause.
                            Mr. GREEN. The reason why I offer this instruction is that I want to
                                settle the question at the start, whether we will keep that
                                emergency clause in almost every bill.
                            Mr. ANTHONY. I heartily agree with the suggestions made by the
                                Senator from Brown. I think there is no bill which requires an
                                emergency clause to such an extent as this. The people in the
                                southern part of Indiana have been most severely imposed upon by
                                those kinds of issues. I sincerely think that the emergency clause
                                ought to remain in this bill - I think the sooner we shut down the
                                better.
                            The instructions proposed were rejected.
                            Mr. MARCH. If in order, I will offer the following additional
                                instructions: "To inquire into the expediency of embracing the paper
                                of broken banks." I understand this bill only refers to the bills of
                                banks not authorized by law and in my opinion there is as much evil
                                resulting from circulating the bills of broken banks. When banks are
                                once broken, persons should not be permitted to circulate their
                                bills.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the committee was so instructed.
                        
                        
                            ELECTIONS - COUNTING OF VOTES.
                            Mr. HILL'S bill (No. 13), proposing to amend the Election law so that
                                the Board of Judges may proceed to count out votes at any time
                                during the receiving of votes when they may have leisure, was read
                                through the second time by the Secretary.
                            Mr. LINE. I move its reference to the committee on
                                    Elections.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                        
                            MISDEMEANORS.
                            Mr. GREEN'S bill (No. 14), proposing to amend an act defining
                                misdemeanors, was read through the second time by the Secretary.
                            Mr. HENDRY. I move that this bill be referred to the
                                    Judiciary Committee.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            ABANDONED HIGHWAYS.
                            Mr. Steele's bill (No. 15)
                                authorizing County Commissioners to take possession of public roads
                                abandoned by toe constructors, was read through the second time by
                                the Secretary.
                            Mr. STEELE. I move to have that bill referred to a special committee
                                of three. I would inform the Senate that there is an emergency
                                existing for the passage of this bill, in my county; we have a plank
                                road which cost some forty thousand dollars and is abandoned by the
                                corporation which built it; our County Commissioners have failed to
                                divide it into road districts, and it is the road over which our
                                mail runs. The object of this bill is to keep that road, and other
                                roads in the same situation throughout the State, in good order. I
                                understand from some Senators in the southern portion of the State,
                                that they have roads in the same condition. Our Commissioners sit
                                next Monday, and I would be glad to have it passed through by that
                                time.The motion was agreed to, and the President appointed Senators
                                Steele, Johnson, and Line, said committee.
                        
                        
                            RELIEF OF JAMES O'BRIEN.
                            Mr. Slack's bill (No. 16) for the relief of James O'Brien, was read
                                through the second time by the Secretary.
                            Mr. LINE: I move to refer this bill to the Committee on
                                    Claims.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. For the information of those Senators who were not here
                                two years ago I will say that this same bill was referred to a
                                committee of which I was one, and that we made a full examination of
                                the matter and found that relief should be granted, but we failed to
                                meet the bill in the Senate to put it upon its passage.
                            Mr. LINE. I withdraw my motion.
                            The bill was then ordered to be engrossed and passed to third
                                reading.
                        
                        
                            QUALIFICATION OF VOTERS.
                            Mr. Cooper's bill (No. 17) having reference to the qualification of
                                voters, was read through the second time by the Secretary.
                            Mr. COOPER moved that this bill be referred to the Committee
                                    on Elections.
                            Mr. JOHNSON. If in order, I would like to offer the following
                                instructions:
                            Amend by striking out all that rebates to a residence of sixty days
                                in the township.
                            I think it is a provision we can not insert into the bill, because I
                                do not think it is according to the Constitution.
                            Mr. CONNER. This bill should be referred to the Judiciary
                                    Committee. I move to amend the motion ot the Senator
                                from Rush, (Mr. Cooper) by moving its reference to the
                                    Judiciary Committee. Another thing, I would
                                suggest to the Senator from Putnam (Mr. Johnson) that he modify his
                                motion so as to require the committee to inquire into the
                                constitutionality of the bill.
                            Mr. JOHNSON. I have no objection to the reference of the bill in that
                                way.
                            Mr. CONNER. Another thing; I see that the bill contains an emergency
                                clause likewise; it seems to be the fashion to add that clause to
                                almost every bill. There has been a resolution passed requiring the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary to report a bill
                                providing in all cases where an emergency clause is enacted, that
                                the bill be published by one newspaper in each County of the State:
                                and I insist that in the case of all bills containing an emergency
                                clause that should be done. If an act should take effect immediately
                                upon its passage, the people should know it, and there is no more
                                speedy method than by publishing the law in a newspaper of their own
                                County. If that law be passed, Senators ought to consider the
                                expense attached to these bills. Again, no important election will
                                take place until this law will go into effect and be published
                                according to the usual method of publishing laws; I therefore move
                                to further instruct the committee to strike out the emergency
                                clause.
                            Mr. JOHNSON. I withdraw my motion.
                            Mr. BOBBS. I believe the bill just before this, sir, having reference
                                to elections, was referred to the Committee on
                                    Elections. I think the Judiciary is
                                the right committee, and I think they both ought to go to the same
                                committee.
                            Mr. MURRAY. The other bill only had reference to that section of the
                                law which authorizes the Judges of elections to count votes.
                            Mr. GOODING. All questions involving constitutional construction, it
                                would be propert to refer to the Judiciary
                                    Committee.
                            The motion to refer the bill to the Judiciary
                                    Committee was agreed to.
                            The motion to instruct the committee to strike out the emergency
                                clause was also agreed to.
                        
                        
                            ELECTION OF TOWNSHIP OFFICERS.
                            Mr. Hill's bill (No. 18) having reference to the election of township
                                officers, was read through the second time by the Secretary.
                            Mr. HILL. I move its reference to the Committee on County
                                    and Township Business.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            REAPPRAISEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN. I ask leave to make a report from the select, committee
                                to which was referred the bills Nos. 1, 3 and 22, on the subject of
                                the reappraisement of real estate.
                            The report recommended the laying on the table of Nos. I and 22, and
                                making numerous amendments to the bill No. 3; and after these

                                Mr. HEFFREN. I ask that the rules be suspended to allow me to
                                    introduce a bill with regard to the issue and transfer of
                                    bonds.
                                The rules were suspended, and -

                                Mr. HEFFREN. I now ask that the rules be suspended, and that this
                                    bill be read a second time by its title, so that it may be
                                    referred to a committee.

                                    suspended, and the bill was read a second time by its title.

                                            is transacting.

                                        Resolved, That the special committee to
                                            investigate the accounts of the State Printer have the
                                            privilege of a clerk.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HUNTER. The Committee on Ways and Means have a
                                clerk, and I thought it had been arranged that he should serve this
                                special committee also.
                            Mr. MILLER. I am satisfied that it will require the service of a good
                                clerk for three or four weeks.
                            The resolution was rejected.
                            Mr. RITTER. Will this action exclude the clerk of the
                                    Committee on Ways and Means?
                            The SPEAKER. I presume not.
                            Mr. MILLER. I shall be constrained to resign my place on that special
                                committee unless we can have a clerk. We want a practical printer
                                clerk, with brass in his face. We might as well dry lap the inquiry
                                at once, if we are not to have this clerk. The committee desire to
                                investigate this matter thoroughly, expecting to bring to light some
                                $20,000 now in the pockets of individuals without authority of law.
                                I hope some gentleman will move a reconsideration.
                            On motion by Mr. PARRETT, the vote was reconsidered, and the question
                                recurred on the adoption of the resolution.
                            Mr. MURRAY. The appointment of this committee was for the sole
                                purpose of investigating the accounts of the State Printer; and I
                                state here, from my knowledge of the printing business, that that
                                committee can not go through their investigations without a
                                practical printer for a clerk. All the matter printed by this
                                officer will have to be re measured; and the manner of making up
                                forms will have to be investigated to see whether overcharging for
                                tokens of press work have not been made; and I undertake to say,
                                that unless they have a practical printer for a clerk, they might as
                                well throw up the business.
                            Mr. AUSTIN. I move to amend so as to provide that this service shall
                                not extend beyond a just limit of time. Unless this be done, there
                                will be a claim laid in for the entire term of the session.
                            Mr. COTTON. If the gentleman from Tippecanoe accepts, I will vote for
                                the resolution.
                            Mr. MILLER accepted:
                            And so the resolution was adopted.
                            Mr. PROSSER moved to add Mr. Murray to this special committee.
                            Mr. MURRAY declined.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair would inform the gentleman from Brown, that
                                nearly every member on that committee, except the chairman, is a
                                practical printer.
                            The motion was withdrawn.
                        
                        
                            TOWNSHIP CLERKS AND TRUSTEES.
                            Mr. COTTON submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on County and Township business be
                                            instructed to inquire into the expediency of doing away
                                            with the offices of township clerks and treasurers, and
                                            requiring two of the trustees to perform the duties
                                            thereof in connection with their duties as trustees.
                                    
                                
                            
                            M. COLGROVE submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the organization of Courts be
                                            instructed to inquire into the expediency of abolishing
                                            the Court of Common Pleas, and providing for a different
                                            mode of doing probate business, and revising the
                                            Practice Act so as to make the same conform to the
                                            proposed changes.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            JEFFERSON'S MANUAL.
                            Mr. GIFFORD. Mr. Speaker, I offered a resolution yesterday which I
                                think was not understood by the House. I refer to that requiring the
                                Doorkeeper to furnish each member with a copy of Jefferson's Manual. It was not the intention to authorize
                                the purchase of that work: for the fact is, as I am imformed, that
                                there are now in the Library some 200 copies of Jefferson's Manual, purchased for the use of members of
                                the Legislature, and all the resolution contemplated was to have
                                them laid on our tables. I hope now that some gentlemen who voted
                                down the resolution, will move a reconsideration.
                            Mr. HALL of Rush. I make that motion.
                            Mr. COLGROVE. I understand the resolution is to purchase these books.
                                If this is the case I am opposed to it. I suppose all members
                                desiring to be posted up in matters of parliamentary law will
                                purchase a Manual for themselves. I have done that. I hope the vote
                                will not be reconsidered.
                            Mr. HALL, of Rush. My impression was that the books were already
                                procured for the purpose. I beg leave now to withdraw the motion to
                                reconsider.
                        
                        
                            PROHIBITORY LIQUOR LAW REPEAL.
                            Mr. DOBBINS introduced a bill (No.

                                manufacture  and sale of
                                spiritous and intoxicating liquors, except in cases therein named,
                                to repeal all acts in conflict therewith, and suppress intemperance;
                                which was passed the first reading.

                                reading.
                        
                        
                            PUBLIC NOTICE IN NEWSPAPERS.
                            Mr. GREGORY introduced a bill (No. 26) to define the duties of
                                Sheriffs, Auditors, Treasurers, Administrators arid other officers

                                newspapers,) which was passed the first reading.
                            Mr. GREGORY also introduced a bill (No. 27) to amend section 2,
                                article 2 of the Constitution of the State of Indiana so as to
                                confine the qualification of electors to free white male citizens of
                                the United States, of the age of twenty-one years and upwards, who
                                shall have resided in the State six months preceding the election,
                                which was passed the first reading.
                        
                        
                            BUSINESS OF THE SESSION.
                            The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of Mr. Duvall's
                                joint resolution, (H. R. 1) in relation to the subject of

                                was passed the second reading.
                            Mr. STANFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I move to refer the resolution to a
                                select committee of five.
                            Mr. SCOTT. I move indefinite postponement. Monsieur Tonson has come
                                again, and I want to place him under the table.
                            But the latter resolution was withdrawn, and the resolution was
                                ordered to be referred to a select committee of five.
                            The SPEAKER, (Mr. Kdwards in the chair,) appointed Messrs. Stanfield,

                                                on Roads be instructed to inquire into the
                                            expediency of declaring Water Courses public highways,
                                            and making it the duty of the Supervisor to keep them
                                            free from obstruction, and report by bill or otherwise,
                                            have at the same under consideration, and report that it
                                            is inexpedient.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The report was concurred in by consent.
                        
                        
                            SWAMP LANDS.
                            Mr. GREEN. Mr. President: I offer the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Swamp Lands be authorized to send for
                                            papers and witnesses, to enable them to fully
                                            investigate the alleged frauds committed in the
                                            management of the swampslands, and the frauds arising
                                            from the sales of said lands.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GOODING. Before we vote upon this resolution, as it will incur a
                                good deal of expense, I would like to know something about these
                                alleged frauds.
                            Mr. GREEN. "Alleged" may be a strong word, but if there is anything
                                in Madam Rumor, there are a good deal of frauds in these swamp land
                                matters. An act donating lands for draining purposes is in force,
                                but somehow or other the lands are gone and the ditching is not
                                done, and there must be swindling going on somehow or other. We want
                                to send for the Swamp Land Commissioners, to see where the fraud
                                is.
                            Mr. GOODING. I understand the Senator wishes to go fishing to
                                ascertain whether Madam Rumor is right.
                            Mr. GREEN. We are satisfied there is something wrong, and we want to
                                fish for it.
                            Upon a division of the Senate, the resolution was adopted.
                            Mr. CONLEY. Mr. President.
                            The PRESIDENT. The following resolution is offered by the Senator
                                from Greene
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the committee apoointed
                                            during the session of the General Assembly in the year
                                            1857, to investigate the conduct and methods resorted to
                                            by persons to secure the passage of the charter for the
                                            Bank of the State of Indiana, be requested to report to
                                            this body as soon as they can do so.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I stated to the Senate but the other day, that the
                                committee would report as soon as it was in their power to do
                                so.

                            Mr. GOODING. Will the Senator inform the Senate whether the report
                                will be in in a few davs?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I suppose it will be in this afternoon.
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            INSURANCE LAW.
                            Mr. FISK. Mr. President.
                            The PRESIDENT. The following resolution is offered by the Senator
                                from Ripley:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Judiciary inquire into the
                                            inefficiency of the present Insurance law and the
                                            difficulties attending its enforcement, and report by
                                            bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was rejected.
                        
                        
                            JURISDICTION OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.
                            Mr. McLEAN. I desire to submit the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                                Committee be requested to inquire into the
                                            expediency of so amending the Justices' Act as to make
                                            the jurisdiction of Magistrates in civil cases
                                            co-extensive with their counties respectively, instead
                                            of townships, as the law now exists; and, if the same be
                                            deemed expedient, to report a bill to that effect at as
                                            early a day as practicable.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was rejected.
                            Mr. McLEAN. I would just simply state that this is a resolution of
                                inquiry, and I trust that the Senate will yet let it go the
                                    Judiciary Committee. I hope the Senate will
                                confer the favor upon me, and permit it to have that reference.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I move a reconsideration of the vote just taken, although
                                I shall always vote against the object of the resolution.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the resolution was adopted by
                                consent.
                        
                        
                            ABANDONED HIGHWAYS.
                            Mr. STEELE. I ask leave to make a report from a select committee.
                            Leave was granted, and Mr. Steele submitted the following report:
                            Mr. PRESIDENT: The select committee to whom was referred Senate bill No. 15 to
                                authorize and empower the County Commissioners or Board doing county
                                business in any county to take possession of arid control any and
                                all plank, gravel and McAdamized roads in their respective counties
                                which may have been abandoned by the corporations, report that they
                                return the bill without amendment, and recommend its passage.
                            The PRESIDENT. The question is, "Shall the bill be engrossed and read
                                a third time?" The Senate agreed, and it was so ordered.
                        
                        
                            HUNTING PARTIES.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President.
                            The PRESIDENT. The following resolution is offered by the Senator
                                from Putnam:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Agriculture be instructed to inquire
                                            into the expediency of enacting some law for the better
                                            protection of fencing and timber against hunting
                                            parties, and report by bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by consent.
                            Mr. BOBBS. Mr. President, I desire to offer the following
                                resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS, Elijah Newland,when Treasurer of State, loaned
                                            to the Madison Railroad Company $32,000; and, whereas,
                                            the said company failed to repay the same, in time to
                                            make payment to the Messrs. Harper, for books furnished
                                            the township libraries, according to the contract with
                                            them; and, whereas, from default of said payment at the
                                            time specified, two acceptances in lieu thereof, for
                                            $16,0 0 each, payable respectively at 8 and 12 months,
                                            in the city of New York, were accepted by the Treasurer;
                                            and, whereas, interest for such deferred payment was
                                            allowed and paid by the Treasurer, out of the township
                                            library fund; therefore, be it - 
                                        Resolved, That the Attorney General be
                                            directed to institute proper proceedings for the
                                            recovery of $1,960 due the library fund, for interest
                                            paid the Messrs. Harper, from said fund, not authorized
                                            by law, in the year 1854, with interest from the elite
                                            of such payment. Provided no adjustment of the same has
                                            been effected.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BOBBS explained the object of the resolution in a few words.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I have only one thing to say: I hope the resolution will
                                be referred to the Committee on Finance.
                            Mr. CRAVENS. I woulk like to make a suggestion to the Senator from
                                Marion. There is a mistake in his resolution that perhaps may be
                                fatal to it. The indebtedness is not upon the part of the Madison
                                and Indianapolis Railroad - it is the Peru Railroad Company, before
                                the consolidation.
                            Mr. HEFFREN. I move its reference to the Committee on
                                    Finance.
                            
                            The motion was agreed to, and the resolution so referred.
                            Mr. MURRAY introduced a bill (No. 56) to amend the 103d section of an
                                act entitled An Act to revise, simplify and abridge the rules,
                                practice pleading and forms of criminal cases of courts in this
                                State, approved June 17, 1852, which was read through, and passed to
                                the second reading.
                            Mr. MURRAY introduced a bill (No. 57) entitled An Act to amend the
                                381st section of the Law Reform Act, which was passed the first
                                reading.
                            Mr. BLAIR introduced a bill (No. 58) to amend the 37th section of an

                                therefor, which was read through, and passed to the second
                                reading.
                            Mr. ANTHONY introduced a bill (No.
                                    59) entitled An Act to amend the third section of the act
                                regulating the licensing of pilots at the falls of the Ohio, which
                                was passed the first reading.
                            Mr. LOMAX introduced a bill (No.
                                    60) to amend an act entitled An Act authorizing
                                agricultural societies to hold real estate, which was passed the
                                first reading.
                            Mr. BENNETT introduced a bill (No. 61) entitled An Act repealing
                                section 60 of chapter 2 of an act entitled An Act to establish
                                courts of conciliation to prescribe rules, which was passed the

                            Mr. BENNETT introduced a bill (No. 63) entitled An Act defining
                                embezzlement and prescribing punishment therefor, which was read
                                through and passed to the second reading.
                        
                        
                            RE APPRAISEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.
                            Mr. HEFFRKN. Mr. President, I move that the order of business be
                                suspended and that we take up bill No. 3, for the reappraisement of real estate.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the Secretary read through the third
                                time the bill (No. 3) to
                                provide for the reappraisement of real estate and prescribing the
                                duties of officers in relation thereto.
                            The yeas and nays were ordered, in pursuance or the Constitutional
                                provision requiring the same on the final passage of the bill, and
                                being taken, resulted - yeas 45, nays 1 - as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS - Messrs. Anthony, Beeson, Blair, Bobbs, Brown,
                                            Carnahan, Cobb, Conley, Conner, Cooper, Cravens of
                                            Jefferson, Cravens of Madison, Culver, Fisk. Gooding,
                                            Green, Hargrove, Heffren, Hendry, Hill, Jennings,
                                            Johnston, Jones, Kinley, Line, Lomax, McClure, McLean,
                                            March, Miller, Murray, O'Brien, Odell, Rice, Robinson,
                                            Shoemaker, Slack, Steele, Stevens, Studabaker,
                                            Tarkington, Thompson, Turner, Wallace, Williams and
                                            Wilson - 45
                                        NAYS - Mr. Conner - 1.
                                    
                                
                            
                            So the bill passed.
                            The title of the bill was then read, and the question being, shall
                                this be the title of the bill? It was so ordered by consent.
                        
                        
                            INDEBTEDNESS OF THE STATE BANK TO THE STATE.
                            Mr. WALLACE. Mr. President: I ask that the rules be suspended in
                                order to enable me to introduce a joint resolution.
                            The Senate consented to a suspension of the rules.
                            Mr. WALLACE introduced a joint resolution (No. 3) touching the
                                indebtedness of the State Bank of Indiana to the State, and
                                appointing a joint committee to make investigation thereof which was
                                read through and passed to the second reading.
                            Mr. BENNETT. I was not within the bar when the vote was taken just
                                now. I desire to record my vote upon the bill for the appraisement
                                of real estate. I vote "No."
                        
                        
                            BILLS ON THE SECOND READING.
                            The PRESIDENT. The Senate will now take up the order of the day -
                                being bills on the second reading.
                            Mr. Studabaker's bill (No. 44) having reference to the safe keeping
                                of the school fund, was read through the second time.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER moved the reference of the bill to a Select Committee
                                of five, and it was so referred.
                            The PRESIDENT appointed Senators Studabaker, Hendry, Miller, March,
                                and Williams said committee.
                            Mr. GOODING made an ineffectual attempt to instruct the Committee to
                                make the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund "five" instead of three,
                                as proposed in the bill.
                        
                        
                            GENERAL ELECTION LAW.
                            Mr. Rice's bill (No. 45) to amend an act regulating general
                                elections, was read through the second time.
                            Mr. RICE moved its reference to the Judiciary
                                    Committee, and it was so referred.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON. I would like to offer the following instructions to the
                                Committee:
                            To strike out all that part that requires a thirty days residence in
                                the county and twenty days residence in the township or ward.
                            I offer these instructions merely to test the sense of the Senate
                                with reference to the constitutionality of such a law. I insist we
                                can make no law limiting the right of suffrage.
                            Mr. RICE. I moved this reference for the purpose of inquiring into
                                the constitutionality of this question. I apprehend it is perfectly
                                constitutional and legal to require even a six months'
                                residence.
                            Mr. WALLACE We might as well settle it in the Senate as in a
                                committee. I am free to say that question for me has a great many
                                doubts. I was of opinion at the last session of the Legislature that
                                an act of the, kind was unconstitutional, and I have not indeed
                                fully made up my mind the other way. He thought the exigencies of
                                the case demanded the passage of some such law at once; and if it
                                should prove to be unconstitutional, there was a tribunal
                                constituted to settle the question as to constitutionality of all
                                acts which were passed by the Legislature.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON. I do not think it admits of a doubt when the
                                constitution reads as plainly as it does. But I do not want to get
                                up a discussion with the Senator from Montgomery, (Mr. Wallace.) The
                                constitution says they who have resided in the State six months
                                shall be entitled to the
                                townships where they reside. The best citizens in the State, who may
                                have resided for years are continually moving. Do you suppose they
                                would submit to such a law? No, sir; they would not be trampled upon
                                in such a way. He would not submit to it a single hour. He would
                                have no hesitancy in taking it up to the Courts.
                            Mr. MURRAY. This question was discussed the last session. If the
                                Senator would so frame his instructions as to authorize the
                                committee to inquire and report, we would have no objections. One of
                                the first questions to be considered is, whether the Assembly has
                                the power to pass the bill. The Legislature has the power to define
                                what constitutes a residence, and the term of residence before the
                                citizen can vote.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON would say it was incompetent for us to contend here with
                                lawyers upon constitutional questions; but he had his opinion. He
                                thought the Senator must stretch his construction as to what he
                                calls qualifications to vote According to his construction, the
                                residence does not commence till after the end of twenty days The
                                Constitution does not so read, but that he shall reside six months
                                before he is a resident, He took it, that a man's residence
                                commences from the time he enters into the State. He was opposed to
                                leaving the doors open for illegal voting, and willing to pass a
                                law, no matter how stringent, to punish illegal voting.
                            Mr. WALLACE wished to direct attention to the fact that the
                                Constitution says that every white male, twenty-one years old, who
                                has resided in the United States one year, in this State six months,
                                and declared his intention to become a citizen, shall be entitled to
                                vote in the precinct where he resides. A man of foreign birth, when
                                he has resided six months, the Constitution says when and where he
                                shall vote. Now arises the question, is it not perfectly within the
                                province of the Legislature to prescribe the residence in the
                                township? The six months' residence is required to have been in the
                                State the Constitution is silent upon township residence. It
                                prescribes a residence in the State, but not in townships. If this
                                Legislature attempted to require of an elector a residence in the
                                township longer than six mouths, that would be a different question.
                                We must neither add to nor take from anything in the Constitution on
                                this bill. He admitted there was doubt arising on this question, but
                                he would not permit the doubt to weigh as against urgent demands for
                                legislation. If it is competent for the Legislature to define the
                                act of residence in the township, it is also within the province of
                                the Legislature to define the evidence of that residence.
                            Mr. ANTHONY. The Senator seems to think we are ready to discuss this
                                constitutional question. If there is a doubt on the constitutional
                                question, let us bring it to the proper tribunal, and if determined
                                against, let us proceed at once to amend the Constitution so as to
                                correct the abuses of the elective franchise. Where there is a
                                doubt, it goes in favor of the exercise of this legislative power.
                                He would vote for the proposition as instructions for inquiry, but
                                was against such positive instructions. He thought this section of
                                the Constitution needed amendment, andwould like to see this doubt
                                determined. This was necessary in order to carry out what would be
                                right and proper.
                            Mr. McLEAN thought this discussion was premature. The
                                    Judiciary Committee was designed to decide
                                this point. He said there was no doubt as to the provision of the
                                Constitution defining who were legal voters. It was susceptible of
                                but one construction. That every white inhabitant of foreign birth
                                who had declared his intention and resided one year was a voter. He
                                was sworn to support the Constitution as he understood it. He moved
                                that the proposition of the Senator from Putnam be amended so as to
                                make it the duty of the Judiciary Committee to
                                inquire into the constitutionality of the law proposed.
                            Mr. HEFFREN had no doubt that any law requiring a township residence
                                of thirty days, or twenty days, would be unconstitutional. The law
                                is that a man shall be sued in the township where he resides, and if
                                he had to remain thirty days before he is a resident it would cause
                                a good deal of trouble. The instructions to inquire into
                                constitutionality he had no objection to. The object was to cut off
                                the migratory or the working classes; and any bill which would take
                                from them the privileges they were entitled to he would war against
                                and vote against.
                            The amendment proposed by the Senator from Vigo was adopted, and the
                                committee were instructed accordingly.

                                upon the qualifications of a voter where a question was raised.
                            This proposition was rejected.
                            Mr. McLean's bill (No. 46) to amend the 9th section of an act to
                                exempt certain property from sale, was read a second time.

                                    Committee, and it was so referred.
                            And then the Senate took a recess till two o'clock.

                            Mr. MURRAY moved that these communications be referred to the
                                    Committee on Finance.

                                    the orders of the day bills on the second reading.

                                Mr. BENNETT moved that it be referred to the Judiciary
                                        Committee, and it was so referred. Mr. Lomax's

                                    second reading.

                                Mr. HEFFREN. I ask the consent of the Senate to make a report
                                    from the Select Committee of the last session on Bank
                                    Frauds.
                                Leave was granted, and Mr. Heffren submitted a report of some
                                    five or six hundred pages of printed matter, and a number of
                                    pages in manuscript.
                                Mr. HEFFREN moved that it lay on the table without reading.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr. MURRAY moved to take up the supplementary part of the report
                                    and that it be referred to the Committee on
                                        Finance.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr. HEFFREN. As there are five or six hundred copies of this
                                    report printed and in the Secretary of State's office, I wish to
                                    offer the following resolution in reference to them:

                                The resolution was adopted.Mr. Heffren's bill (No. 50) to amend

                                Mr. MURRAY moved its reference to the Judiciary
                                        Committee, and it was so referred.
                                Mr. Tarkington's bill (No. 55) to provide for the safe keeping of

                                KANSAS.
                                Mr. Wallace's Joint Resolution (No. 1) having reference to the
                                    admission of Kansas into the Union, and instructing our Senators
                                    and requesting our Representatives in relation thereto, was read
                                    the second time.
                                Mr. WALLACE said he desired to speak to that resolution, but as
                                    he had not the health sufficient to make the attempt today, he
                                    moved that it be laid on the table, and made the special order
                                    for Monday, at 2 1/2 o'clock.
                                Mr. MARCH offered a substitute.
                                Mr. FISK also offered a substitute.
                                Mr. BENNETT moved to refer the subject to the whole people, and
                                    make it the special order for the second Tuesday in October,
                                    1860.
                                Mr. GOODING wished it further postponed; and took occasion to
                                    define his political position in a very few words.
                                Mr. CONNER moved to lay the resolution and pending amendments on
                                    the table; but withdrew the motion immediately.
                                Mr. WALLACE modified his motion so as to make his resolution the
                                    special order for Tuesday.
                                Mr. SLACK thought it was wrong to consume the time of the Senate
                                    in the discussion of these questions. Therefore he renewed the
                                    motion of the Senator from Wabash (Mr. Conner) to lay the
                                    resolution and pending amendments on the table; but immediately
                                    withdrew it.
                                Mr. McLEAN suggested as an amendment to the amendment of the
                                    Senator from Delaware (Mr. March) that we proceed to elect
                                    members of Congress in the place of Hughes and others.
                                Mr. WALLACE repeated his motion for the postponement till
                                    Tuesday.
                                Mr. MARCH stated that his amendment represented his view upon
                                    this question.
                                Mr. SLACK moved to have the motion of the Senator from Montgomery
                                    (Mr. Wallace) on the table.
                                The yeas and nays were demanded by Senators Slack and Heffren,
                                    and being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 23, nays 24, as
                                    follows:

                                Mr. MILLER, when his name was called, said he voted "no," not
                                    because he approved of these resolutions being introduced here,
                                    but out of courtesy to the gentleman who introduced them.
                                So the motion was not laid on the table.
                                Mr. HEFFREN moved Tuesday week.
                                Mr. SLACK proposed three weeks from next Tuesday.
                                Mr. ANTHONY said it was out of no disrespect to gentlemen who
                                    wished to submit their views on this subject, that he voted for
                                    postponement.
                                The yeas and nays were demanded by Senators Slack and Heffren,

                                    to the mover, he would vote "no."

                            Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Decatur has a
                                resolution adopted, tendering the use of the Hall to the Hon. Mr.
                                    Walker, I move that a
                                committee be appointed to wait on him and notify him of the
                                fact.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY. I would like to know who in the thunder this honorable
                                Henry Walker? [Laughter.]
                            Mr. SCOTT. And for what purpose is the committee to wait on him?
                            Mr. DURHAM. For the purpose of inform the honorable Henry Walker that
                                this Hall has been tendered to him for the delivery of his address
                                on elocution and the fine arts.
                            The motion was adopted.
                            Mr. DAVIS considered it a lowering of the dignity of the body to
                                invite itinerent lecturers to speak in this Hall. He desired a
                                reconsideration, so that, if this proceeding went upon the journal,
                                it should be, that the thing was voted down.
                            The SPEAKER The House has refused to reconsider.
                            Mr. DAVIS.I don't think there was a quorum voting.
                            Mr. SCOTT. I move to reconsider the vote for the appointment of a
                                committee.
                            The motion was agreed to, and then
                            Mr. EDWARDS obtained leave to withdraw the motion for the
                                committee.
                        
                        
                            MAINE LIQUOR LAW.
                            The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of bills on the
                                second reading; and the bill by Mr. Dobbins (H. R. 23) to repeal the
                                Prohibitory Liquor Law, coming up, it was passed the second
                                reading.
                            Mr. THOMPSON, of Madison, moved to refer the bill to the
                                    Committee on Temperance; but the motion was
                                withdrawn, on account of the opposition of Mr. Dobbins.
                            Mr STANFIELD moved to amend by striking out the last section
                                requiring publication in the Indianapolis papers.
                            The amendment was agreed to; and so the bill was ordered to be
                                engrossed for a third reading.

                                coming up, it was passed the second reading.
                            Mr. GRIFFIN proposed to amend by extending the time two weeks for
                                holding the court in Lake county in said circuit.
                            Mr. MERRIFIELD accepted, and the amendment vas concurred in by
                                consent.
                            On motion by Mr. STANFIELD, the bill was referred to a select
                                committee, which the Speaker makes to consist of Messrs. Stanfield,

                            Mr. EDWARDS moved to refer the bill to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary with the following instructions: "To inquire
                                into the constitutionality of the provisions of the bill." 
                            The motion was agreed to, and the bill so referred.

                                the matter of giving public notice in newspapers, coming up, it was
                                passed the second reading.
                            On motion by Mr. DOBBINS, it was referred to the Committee
                                    on Rights and Privileges.
                            Mr. Gregory's bill (H. R. 27) to amend the second section of the
                                second article of the Constitution of the State of Indiana, coming
                                up, it was passed the second reading.
                            On motion by Mr. GRIFFIN, it was referred to the Committee
                                    on Rights and Privileges.
                        
                        
                            UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            Mr. Branham's bill (H. R. 28) providing for the time, place and
                                manner of electing United States Senators, coming up, it was passed
                                the second reading.
                            Mr. GIFFORD moved its reference to a select committee of five.
                            Mr. AUSTIN proposed to refer the bill to the Committee on
                                    the Judiciary.
                            Mr. HARNEY said he would like that the House would instruct the
                                    Judiciary Committee to inquire into the
                                constitutionality of the provisions of the bill.
                            The SPEAKER. That would be in order after disposing of the question
                                of reference.
                            Mr. Austin's motion was agreed to, and the bill was referred
                                accordingly
                        
                        
                            CANAL AROUND THE OHIO FALLS.
                            Mr. Prosser asked and obtained unanimous consent to offer a joint
                                Resolution (No. 3) with reference to the construction of a canal
                                around the falls of the Ohio river by the General Government, and
                                the same was passed the first reading, by consent.
                            The House then took a recess till two o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            A message from the Senate announced the passage of the bill (S. 3) for reappraisement of
                                real estate, &c., requesting the concurrence of the House of
                                Representatives.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House an official statement of the
                                condition of the Terre Haute Branch of the Bank of the State of
                                Indiana.

                            
                                TAXATION FOR REVENUE.
                                The SPEAKER then announced the special order - the consideration
                                    of Mr. Edwards' resolution with reference to taxation for
                                    revenue, heretofore printed.
                                Mr. MARTIN proposed to amend by substituting the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            "Resolved, That it is the first and
                                                most important duty of the Legislature at the
                                                present session to pass a Revenue bill for the
                                                present year."
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. HUNTER moved to lay the amendment on the table, which,
                                After several parliamentary motions, was withdrawn for - 
                                Mr. EDWARDS. I do not intend to occupy time, but I have to state,
                                    that in offering the original resolution, I was not governed by
                                    partisan considerations. The Governor mentioned as one of the
                                    reasons for convening this Legislature the existing necessity
                                    for the passage of a revenue law. Sir, whilst I regret that necessity, I beg leave to
                                    state, that four years ago, as you may remember, the opposition
                                    had a majority in this branch of the Legislature, and the Senate
                                    was Democratic. That at that time the Senate refused to come
                                    into joint session for the election of United States Senators;
                                    and, therefore, the General Assembly failed to pass the
                                    requisite apprasement and revenue laws. You remember that, in
                                    1856, we had the Senate, and the House of Representatives was
                                    Democratic, and then the Senate refused to meet the House for
                                    the election of United States Senators, and so failed again to
                                    pass laws for revenue. So it happens that both parties are at
                                    fault, and the State has to suffer the consequences. It is tor
                                    this Legislature to propose the remedy. We argue that the law of
                                    assessment as it now exists, is unequal, onerous and unjustdoes
                                    not comply with the requisition of the Constitution, which
                                    requires that the Legislature shall pass laws for the equal and
                                    uniform assessment of property for taxation. Now, if you will
                                    look at the Auditor's report, you will find this is the case. I
                                    find this inequality bearing more heavily on my people in Vigo,
                                    than, perhaps, in almost any other county. In Vigo, with 260,000
                                    acres of land, we have assessment of $8,500,000, whilst
                                    Montgomery and Putuam, each having more land and more valuable,
                                    remain with a much lighter assessment. He proceeded to show that
                                    the same inequality stood against the people of the counties of
                                    Floyd and Jefferson. It was manifestly not right to insist on
                                    taxing the real estate of the people upon the present valuation.
                                    We should be more careful to comply with the Constitution. The
                                    prices of lands had changedall our railroads, except the Madison
                                    and Indianapolis, had been built since the last appraisement. A
                                    new appraisement would materially increase the amount of taxable
                                    property. Representation and taxation ought to go together,
                                    &c.
                                Mr. MURRAY was in favor of the original resolution. It was nearly
                                    identical with his, offered earlier than this. He looked at the
                                    question in another point. The people were illy prepared for a
                                    heavy tax. The corn was one-third and the wheat crop one-half
                                    less than average, and oats and potatoes were a failure. Again,
                                    the counties and townships had levied heavier taxes on account
                                    of the State's delinquency. Again, it would make confusion in
                                    the collection of the revenue, resulting in much expense. His
                                    County Auditor had declared it next to impossible to add another
                                    levy to the present duplicate. Again, he was opposed to levying
                                    a tax to pay the delinquency of a party or parties in the
                                    Legislatures. These reasons would govern his action.
                                Mr. MARTIN. The amendment only looks to the revenue for the
                                    present season. Would the people be better able to pay the
                                    present year's revenue hereafter? It could not be disguised that
                                    the Republican party were responsible for the acts of this
                                    session and the next. He was for taxing for revenue. "Casual
                                    deficiency," the words of the Constitution, could not apply to
                                    the present deficiency, which was the result of wilful
                                    negligence. If we borrow money and go home without a tax for
                                    revenue, it will be charged that we have increased the already
                                    too burdensome public debt. The adoption of a similar policy of
                                    shirking taxes, was the cause of the destruction of the old Whig
                                    party, and it would kill any party. He admitted that there would
                                    be inequality in the present assessment, and regretted it; but
                                    we must look at matters as we find them. The same argument also
                                    would have applied four years ago. As to the plea of inequality
                                    in representation, he insisted that the wheels of Government
                                    must not be stopped till we get a new apportionment. He would
                                    net levy now for paying the revenue deficiency of last year, but
                                    only the present. He would take the Governor's recommendation in
                                    this matter.
                                Mr. WHITEMAN. The proposed levy would be just a matter to
                                    encumber the records. If the levy would fetch the money by the
                                    first of January, the argument would be worth something; but
                                    collections could not be made in time to answer the demands of
                                    the treasury.
                                Mr. GIFFORD. The levying of a tax at this time would operate
                                    unequally. He was not prepared to vote - waiting for the report
                                    of the Committee on Ways and Means. He would
                                    sustain the credit of 'the State by additional taxation if
                                    necessary; but he preferred resorting to a loan for the
                                    present.
                                Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren, spoke at length against the levy on
                                    account of the difficulties it would involve in the records; and
                                    in favor of a loan for State purposes till next July.
                                Mr. DOBBINS was in favor of the levy; for then we could more
                                    readily borrow the money that might be needed. He would meet the
                                    question fairly, without party feeling, for the common good. The
                                    people of Martin county were willing to pay their taxes, from an
                                    impulse of patriotism, to sustain the State of Indiana. The
                                    course suggested by the amendment would show to capitalists that
                                    we were preparing to pay back the money we have to borrow.
                                Mr. PROSSER argued that a just and equal tax could be levied for
                                    1859-60, and if that were as high as 40 cents on the hundred
                                    dollars, it would be more cheerfully paid than 20 cents would be
                                    paid now. He shrunk not from responsibility in this, and cared
                                    not for the allusion to the causes that crushed the Whig
                                    party.
                                Mr. SCOTT. The people were anxious to know whether they were to
                                    be burdened with another tax this year. He spoke for himself,
                                    not party, when he said the people would almost rebel against a
                                    second tax. It was certainly our duty to sustain the State
                                    credit, and he trusted it could be done without a double tax. If
                                    this course was to crush his party, let it be so; he trusted the
                                    people freely for that.
                                Mr. AUSTIN answered for the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means, whose report gentlemen were waiting for.
                                    They could not report before maturing their propositions.
                                    Gentlemen say they would be glad to get along without another
                                    levy for this year. He had no doubt but we could get along
                                    without that. A loan would have to be resorted to any how. It
                                    was notorious that the people generally were very illy prepared
                                    to pay an additional tax at this time. He promised from the
                                        Committee on Ways and Means a
                                    saitisfactory  report. He
                                    saw no good to come from this hurry about levying a tax. It
                                    would be much easier to pay our indebtedness if we could get the
                                    time lengthened out. He was in favor of the resolution without
                                    the amendment.
                                Mr. GRIFFEN spoke of the deficiency of the crops in his region.
                                    The delinquent tax list was greater than ever betore, and from
                                    this he argued against imposing a tax unexpectedly now in the
                                    close of the year. It might not fall so heavily in other and
                                    older portions of the State. He deprecated party considerations
                                    in connection with this question. Money was worth 20 per cent
                                    with his constituents; and if this money could be borrowed by
                                    the State for 6 or 7 per cent, he argued thence the economy of
                                    the course proposed in the resolution, which he favored against
                                    the amendment.
                                Mr. HAMILTON also alleged a failure of the crops in his region.
                                    The loan was inevitable. He cared not for its effect upon the
                                    Republican party. He looked alone to the propriety of the tax
                                    and he regarded it as impolitic. Why not let this year be
                                    returned delinquent, and let the deficiency be made up by an
                                    additional levy next year, the year following, &c.?
                                Mr. COLGROVE was not prepared to vote on this question. But we
                                    must have money for the January interest, and that must be
                                    raised by loan. How this and the money to carry on the
                                    government should be raised was an important question. He was
                                    opposed to creating a debt without providing the means of its
                                    payment. Some looked to the Sinking Fund, others to Wall Street.
                                    He favored the latter. The Sinking Fund belonged to the children
                                    of the State - amounting now to about $2,750,000 - to be soon
                                    increased, when the bank gets through, to perhaps three
                                    millions. Under unwise legislation, in 1842, the State became
                                    debtor to that Fund to the amount of $750,000, and yet not one
                                    dollar of interest had been paid on that debt. He showed, from
                                    the report, the true state of this account - the interest the
                                    State owes it, being above $424,000. He figured up the loss to
                                    this Fund (if it had been well managed) of more than $1,200,000.
                                    In this view, he would ask if any man would be willing to lay
                                    his hand again upon this fund? No! let anything come - taxation
                                    - disgrace even, before any vote of his should be given to touch
                                    this Fund again. The money could be obtained in the market at 6
                                    percent, &c. He repeated that he was not prepared to say
                                    whether it would be wisest to levy now or defer it to the
                                    future. The passage of the resolution would be a sort of
                                    forestalling of the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means.
                                Mr. BRANHAM. The demands of the Treasury could not be met by the
                                    levy for 1858. All the question with him was whether a porton of
                                    the levy for 1859 should pay the July interest. The gentleman's
                                    levy of 20 cents would give $900,000, and his 60 cents would
                                    give $2,700,000. It was not necessary to scare the people with
                                    such figures. They were unnecessary. The Auditor's report was
                                    not always reliable. We could not tell to-day how much was in
                                    the Treasury. He did not want it to go to the country that we
                                    have to make anything like a 60 cents levy.
                                Mr. COLGROVE had based his statement on the Auditor's report. It
                                    was important that we should have a just valuatio , and then to
                                    decide between paying at once or through two or three years.
                                Mr. BARNEY. Procrastination was the cry of a hard debtor. It
                                    never paid a debt. Punctuality was the life of business, and
                                    this the people understood well but arguments conflict. Some say
                                    the tax would be burdensome. Another, the gentleman from
                                    Jefferson, thinks 20 cents on the hundred dollars will suffice.
                                    The thousands would pay their distribution shares of the debt at
                                    once, and prefer to do so. He admitted the necessity of a loan
                                    for the present He showed from the 7th Article of the
                                    Constitution that we could not legally take anything from the
                                    Trust Funds. Looking at former legislation, we would go into the
                                    market with a bad grace and worse success as a borrower. We
                                    could get the money in one way - by funding a debt and paying it
                                    in bonds. If the people were too poor to be taxed, let us
                                    adjourn and go home, and not sit here legislating upon tick.
                                    There never was perfect equality in the assessments for
                                    taxation. The argument of inequality would be just as good
                                    against all taxes. He would not adopt such an argument, although
                                    it might be most applicable to the people of his county,
                                    &c.
                                Mr. PROSSER moved to postpone the further consideration of the
                                    resolution and amendment, and that it be made the special order
                                    for to morrow at two o'clock.The motion was agreed to, and the
                                    subject was postponed accordingly.
                                The House then adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            FRIDAY, December 3, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read and corrected.
                        Mr WAGNER offered a petition from A. Stephenson for compensation for
                            pursuing and prosecuting horse-stealing, and moved that it be referred
                            to the committee on claims without reading.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        
                            BUILDING OF TOWNS.
                            Mr. CONNER submitted a report from the Committee on
                                    Corporations,which bad under consideration the bill
                                (No. 20) recommending its passage: and it was read the second time
                                by its title, and ordered to a third reading. [This is Mr.
                                Shoemaker's bill, having reference to the building of towns]
                        
                        
                            SHERIFF'S FEES.
                            Mr. STEVENS introduced a bill (No. 66) entitled An Act, requiring
                                parties to civil suits to advance the fees of Sheriffs in cases
                                herein specified, which was read through the firsttime and passed to
                                the second reading.
                        
                        
                            A TEMPERANCE BILL.
                            Mr. BENNETT introduced a bill (No 67) entitled An Act to suppress
                                tippling houses, to prevent drunkenness and crime, regulating the
                                traffic in spirituous and malt liquors, and repealing all acts in contradiction of the same,
                                which was read through the first time.
                            Mr. BENNETT moved that the rules be suspended, and that the bill be
                                read a second time by its title.
                            In accordance with the constitutional provision the yeas and nays
                                were ordered, and being taken, resulted - yeas 36, nays 4.
                            Two thirds voting in the affirmative, the rules were suspended; the
                                bill was read a second time by its title.
                            Mr. BENNETT moved that it be referred to the Committee of
                                    Temperance, and it was so referred.
                            Mr. STEVENS offered an additional section:
                            Sec.All costs taxed by any Justice of the Peace, or any court having
                                competent jurisdiction, shall be considered a part of the judgment,
                                and the defendant shall stand committed until the judgment and costs
                                are fully paid.
                            Mr. MURRAY was not in favor of keeping the offender in jail until he
                                paid the costs of his prosecution.
                            Mr. STEVENS made his amendment a matter of inquiry at the suggestion
                                of the Senator from Howard, [Mr. Murray.]
                            Mr. STEVENS offered an additional amendment, by requiring Prosecuting
                                Attorneys, on reasonable grounds of suspicion, to file information
                                against any person whom he may suppose, from personal observations,
                                to be guilty of any violations of the provisions of this act, before
                                any Justice of the Peace, or any court having jurisdiction.
                            Mr. MURRAY would vote for as stringent a law as anybody, but he had
                                objections to this amendment.

                            A Senate message now announced the passage in that body of the bill
                                    (S. 31) fixing Court time
                                in the county of Bartholomew.
                        
                        
                            COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS.
                            Mr. MURRAY. Mr. Speaker, there is a deficiency in the
                                    Committee on Elections. Mr. Wood wishes to be
                                excused from service.
                            The SPEAKER. The Journals have been corrected in that, and Mr. Harney
                                has been appointed in the place of Mr. Wood on that committee.
                        
                        
                            ABSENCE.
                            Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Power had leave of absence on account of ill

                            Mr, CLEMENTS, from the select committee on this subject, reported a
                                recommendation for placing two steam furnaces in the basement, under
                                the Hall of the Capitol.
                            The report was rejected.
                            Mr. MERRIFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I find in the printed list of the
                                standing committees that my name and Mr. Snyder's have been
                                incorrectly placed as on the Committee on the Sinking
                                    Fund.
                            The SPEAKER. These are mistakes in the printing.
                            The House now took a recess till two o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTEROON SESSION.
                            Mr. KEEFER asked and obtained leave to record his vote in favor of
                                the passage of Mr. Dobbins' bill to repeal the Indiana Maine Liquor
                                law, which was passed to the third reading this morning.
                        
                        
                            COMMITTEE ON ORGANIZATION OF COURTS.
                            Mr CAVINS submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved. That two members be added to
                                            the Committee on the organization of
                                                Courts.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            TAX FOR REVENUE.
                            The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz: The consideration of
                                Mr. Edwards' resolution, declaring the expediency of a loan of money
                                for State purposes, to be paid out of assessments of taxes based
                                upon a just appraisement of real estate, and to be divided between
                                several years, commencing with the year 1859 - the question being on
                                the adoption of Mr. Martin's substitute, declaring it to be the
                                first duty of this Legislature to pass a revenue bill for the year
                                1858 - 
                            Mr TURPIE took the floor, and insisted on prompt action in the matter
                                of paying the needful revenue. He regretted that no committee had
                                reported their plan to begin this work. There was no difficulty
                                about the tax receipts already given. A receipt was good only up to
                                the time of its date. He saw no great difficulty in the way of
                                making a levy for this year, and believed there was yet time enough,
                                if it were well improved. No man thought of paying the January
                                instalment of interest by tax collections. But the levy would put us
                                on the vantage ground as borrowers. It was to gain time for the
                                payment of the State debt by instalments, that he desired to begin
                                now. He stopped not to inquire whether the levy could be paid. It
                                was no argument against the levy to say it would not lie paid The
                                bill authorizing the levy could be matured, signed and published in
                                ten days. He scouted the idea of being affected on this question by
                                those skyey influences upon which depend the crops of the farmer. It
                                was said we should wait for the report of the Committee on
                                    Ways and Means. What light could they give? Certain
                                members had attempted yesterday to enlighten the House, and their
                                effort was little more or better than to make the surrounding
                                darkness visible. The committee ought to have reported long ago.
                                Only yesterday the chairman of the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means had shown by the introduction of a bill, that
                                his mind was more occupied with that magnificent farce, the election
                                of United States Senators, than with this question of revenue.
                            Mr. DAVIS objected to continual references to party interests in
                                connection with this question of revenue. His position was
                                individual on this question. Divested of party biases, it had but
                                one side. It was enough to know that trouble was upon the State, without inquiring who
                                are most at fault. Both parties were at fault What need then have we
                                further for the services of the drill sergeants of party? He
                                commended them all to the Old Boy, to whom all parties, save one
                                (the old Whig) seemed to be drifting. He contrasted the inequality
                                of the condition of the taxpayers in the counties of Floyd and St.
                                Joseph on account of the present appraisement of real estatethe poor
                                lands of Floyd were assessed at $15 an acre, whilst the fertile
                                fields of St. Joseph were assessed at $4 an acre. Taxation should be
                                equal: and this should be remedied. He referred also to the
                                exemption of our bank stock in the hands of foreign stockholders. He
                                would not authorize a levy till this property should be brought upon
                                the duplicate. He insisted also upon taxing the property of Railroad
                                Companies, before the next levy should be made. The first thing we
                                should do was to provide for a just mode of property valuation. The
                                man of money and notes pays full tax on what he holds, whilst the
                                land holder in many cases pays, perhaps, only on the fourth part of
                                the value of his lands. He also referred to the present pressure on
                                account of the prop failures. He was in favor of borrowing to meet
                                these deficiencies, and taxing to make it up, under a just
                                assessment. He would borrow from abroad not all at once, but in such
                                amounts and at such times as would be necessary to get along. Let us
                                all contribute to relieve the burdens of the State according to our
                                several abilities- The loan could be wiped out in less than four
                                years, by a tax of twenty cents on the hundred dollars. A present
                                levy would be troublesome, and trouble would make expense,
                                &c.
                            Mr. BRANHAM spoke for his colleagues in the committee, and of the
                                difficulties in their way. They found that the alleged means in the
                                Treasury were not available. They were protested acceptances. The
                                Treasurer had told him that he would soon be able to report one
                                hundred and forty thousand dollars in the Treasury, available for
                                the January interest. The committee could not get at the accounts.
                                How was it that the amount of interest on the public debt was
                                increasing? We want to know how much the whole debt is. When we make
                                a statement, we want to show that we know what we are about. He
                                could inform gentlemen, he thought, that the condition of the
                                finances was not quite so bad as the fears of some would indicate.
                                With reference to the July interest, he affirmed that it would cost
                                more to collect the tax on the duplicate of 1858, than to pay the
                                interest on the loan required. He even doubted whether enough could
                                be collected on such a levy to pay that interest. Suppose you
                                advance the value of Indiana stock in the market, the advantage goes
                                all into the pockets of the brokers holding our bonds, at the
                                expense of our tax-grinding operation on the people- We were buying
                                in our bonds, and such a policy could not help us in that.
                            Mr. TURPIE was willing to reciprocate the disclaimer of party feeling
                                on the part of gentlemen. He proceeded to reply to the argument
                                against a present levy - alleging the difficulty of avoiding
                                inequality and injustice in appraisements and assessment. He
                                insisted that the farmers were taxed more strictly than any other
                                class of men. He took the view that we are not to blame for this
                                inequality. Because others have neglected their duty, would that
                                justify us in returning to the people without raising this revenue.
                                No one had proposed to pay off the entire indebtedness of the State.
                                He said, let us have a light levy, but let it be something. With
                                regard to the hope of better crops, gentlemen had taken up the
                                refrain of yesterday - "Wait a little while - there's a good time
                                coming, boys." This was worth nothing, without assurances as to
                                dates. He had never said the financial condition of the State was
                                desperate.
                            Mr. HANCOCK remarked that his people were willing and able to pay the
                                revenue required of them.
                            Mr. RYNEARSON preferred to be guided by the report of the Auditor. He
                                read from the Constitution to show the cases in which the
                                Legislature may authorize a loan. The present deficiency of revenue
                                was not a "casual deficit." The report of the Auditor showed a
                                necessity for appropriations to the amount of $559,000. Suppose half
                                this is borrowed in Wall street, what future Legislature would make
                                a levy to pay it? If gentlemen would lengthen out the time of
                                paying- the State indebtedness, let them begin now. Gentlemen want
                                time to financier, and they will raise the July interest out of the
                                revenue of 1859. This reappraisement could not be made till the fall
                                of 1859. The Chairman of the Committee had alleged that it would
                                take more money to pay the Auditors and Collectors than to pay the
                                interest of the needful loan. He had consulted many of these
                                officers, and had learned from them that if the assessments were in
                                round numbers, as fifteen cents on the hundred dollars, the
                                collection would be a very easy job. If we defer the evil day one
                                year we may defer it ten years as well. He preferred to meet the
                                difficulty at the threshhold. All the objections to the levy
                                dwindled into nothing when compared with tire greater evil of an
                                increase of the public debt.
                            Mr. PARRETT was in favor of levying lor a portion of the amount
                                necessary. If we do nothing now, in 1860 we will have to collect a
                                million and a half of dollars. He regarded the estimates of the
                                gentleman from Jefferson as half too small. He was hardly satisfied
                                that the inequality in appraisements were as great as gentlemen
                                pretended. It might be true with regard to a few counties; but his
                                researches had convinced him that the value of property had
                                increased rapidly in all parts of the State - the South as well as
                                the North. The lands were assessed in 1851, but in 1857 the lands
                                    and the improvements were assessed, and this
                                fact lessens the weight and force of the argument of inequality. He
                                wanted the State debt extinguished instead of being increased in
                                1860; and he would make a levy for 1858 sufficient to meet the
                                revenue demanded for this year.
                            Mr. HALL of Rush supported the part of those who would have a just
                                appraisement first, and then a levy; and he thought the whole could
                                be arranged and in operation in the course of three months. He
                                replied at length to the objections to this course.
                            Mr. BAIRD gave notice that if the question was not put soon, there was a
                                combination around where he sat, to insist on the right to Speak
                                round." ("Question, question.")
                            Mr. PROSSER moved to lay the amendment the table.

                                resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary be requested to
                                            inquire into the expediency of reporting a bill,
                                            providing that negroes may testify in State cases where
                                            white persons are interested, and allow the jury to
                                            judge of the credibility of such evidence.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. WEIR moved that the resolution be laid upon the table; but
                                withdrew his motion for
                            Mr. MARCH, who trusted that no person's sense of propriety would be
                                offended here by the introduction of this resolution. He believed
                                that this was the first insrance that it had been attempted to
                                refuse an appropriate reference to a resolution of inquiry.
                            Messrs. HEFFREN and LINE cited cases to the contrary.
                            Mr. MARCH contended that it was a mere matter concerning evidence,
                                and he did not suppose the saving of the Union, or of any party, had
                                anything to do with it. It was simply a question whether the
                                    Judiciary Committee should inquire into the
                                propriety of changing the rules of evidence.
                            Mr. CONNER moved to amend the resolution by adding: "Indians."
                                [Laughter.] He offered the amendment in all candor; about forty of
                                his constituents were Indians, and a more orderly set of persons
                                could not be found.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. GOODING. I desire to say a word before the question is taken. At
                                the last session of this Senate I voted to refer all petitions on
                                this same subject, both from whites and blacks, to the appropriate
                                committee, in order to get a report from that committee. I have
                                believed in the right of petition ever since the days of John Quincy
                                    Adams. But the majority of
                                that committee were republicans, and for some cause or other they
                                never made a report. I desired to get a report on one side or the
                                other, but they managed to dodge the question. A majority of the
                                    Judiciary Committee are Republicans, and now
                                I want to know whether these charges against their party of negro
                                equality are true or not. I shall vote to refer this matter to them,
                                and I don't care which side they report on, but if they report to
                                allow negroes to testify against white men, I shall vote against
                                their report.
                            Mr. WEIR. I wish to ask the Senator a question: The object and
                                benefit of that report?
                            Mr. GOODING One object is this: To ascertain whether these charges,
                                that they favor negro equality, negro testimony and all that kind of
                                a thing. If they report in the affirmative, then this charge is
                                true; if in the negative, they have trown it off. I desire to give
                                them an opportunity to show themselves upon the Journals.
                            Mr. WEIR I renew my motion to lay the resolution upon the table.
                            Upon this motion the yeas and nays were demanded by Senators Heffren
                                and Murray, and being ordered and taken, resulted yeas 22, nays
                                19
                            So the resolution was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
                            Mr. STEELE asked and obtained leave of absence for the Senator from
                                Wayne. [Mr. Beeson.]
                            Mr. HEFFREN asked and obtained leave of absence for the Senator from
                                Dearborn. [Mr. O'Brien.]
                        
                        
                            SENATE DIRECTORY.
                            Mr. LINE asked and obtained permission to offer the following
                                resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved That the Door-keeper be and is
                                            hereby authorized to have 300 copies of the names of
                                            Senators, their post-office address, age, nativity, the
                                            number of sessions they have served in either branch of
                                            the General Assembly, and the county or counties they
                                            now represent printed for the use of the members of this
                                            Senate.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GOODING moved to amend by adding, in the proper place, the word
                                "their politics."
                            Mr. GREEN suggested that it would be better to strike out the word
                                "age."
                            Mr. MARCH suggested that the likeness of of each member be put
                                on.
                            A Senator moved that each member be required to foot his proportion
                                of the bill.
                            The motion was lost.
                            The question recurring upon Mr. Gooding's motion - 
                            Mr. CONNER suggested that a blank space be left to note the fact if
                                any Senator should change his politics. [Laughter.]
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            RAILROAD RESPONSIBILITY.
                            Mr. CULVER obtained unanimous consent to offer a resolution requiring
                                the Judiciary Committee to examine and report
                                whether the General Assembly can pass a law compelling Railroad
                                Companies to pay for killing animals where the rail road can not be
                                fenced.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            COST OF TRANSPORTING CONVICTS.
                            Mr. BOBBS obtained consent to offer a resolution requiring the
                                    Finance Committee to inquire into the
                                expediency of recommending the passage of a law lessening the
                                expense of transporting convicts to the State Prison, which was
                                adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            CONVENTIONAL INTEREST.
                            Mr. CULVER, by consent, introduced a bill (No. 72) to amend the 1st
                                section and repeal the 7th section of an act concerning the interest
                                on money, approved May 7, 1852, which was read through and passed to
                                the second reading.
                            [This bill provides that the interest on money shall be ten per cent,
                                upon a written agreement to that effect, but no greater rate of
                                interest shall be lawful, either directly or indirectly, but the
                                rates shall be six per cent, where no written agreement exists,
                                whether fora shorter or longer period, and that this act shall go
                                into effect on the first day of March 1859.]
                        
                        
                            FELONY.
                            Mr. BENNETT, by consent, introduced a bill (No. 73) to amend the 51st
                                section of an act defining Felony and prescribing the punishment
                                therefor, approved June 11,1852, which was read through and passed
                                to the second reading.
                            [This bill provides that, instead of sending females convicted of
                                felony to the State Prison, they be confined in the county jail,
                                under the direction of the jailor.]
                        
                        
                            UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            Mr. CRAVEN obtained unanimous consent of the Senate to make the
                                following report:
                            Mr. PRESIDENT - The Committee on Federal Relations
                                to whom was referred Senate bill
                                    No. 28, "A bill to provide for the election of United
                                States Senators," and the proposed amendment thereto, have had the
                                same under consideration and instruct me to report it back to the
                                Senate with the recommendation that said proposed amendment be
                                adopted, and that the title to said bill be an ended to read as
                                follows, to-wit: "An act to prescribe the time, place and manner of
                                electing United States Senators, and to fix the penalty upon
                                officers failing to certify to said elec-i tions," and that when
                                said bill and the title thereto are so amended, recommend its
                                passage.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER moved that the consideration ot the bill and the
                                report be postponed until the 25th day of December.
                            On this motion the yeas and nays were demanded by Messrs. Bennett and
                                March, and being ordered, and taken, resulted - yeas 12, nays 25 -
                                as follows:

                                            Robinson, Steele, Thompson, Turner, Wagner, and Wilson -
                                            25.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. ANTHONY, when his name was called, said: I am in favor of the
                                passage of that law. The State of Indiana has suffered enough
                                already for the want of just such a law. I vote "Aye."
                            Mr. CONNER, when his name was called, said that he was paired off
                                with the Senator from Huntington, (Mr. Slack) but this question was
                                excepted.
                            Mr. STEVENS, when his name was called, said that he did not consider
                                this a political question, but as he had paired off with the Senator
                                from Green (Mr. Conley) he would not vote.
                            So the Senate refused to postpone.
                            
                            Mr. HARGROVE moved to amend the committee report by striking out the
                                emergency clause.
                            Mr. WEIR stated that the reason he did not vote upon the question
                                just taken was that he had paired off with the Senator from Allen.
                                (Mr. Hamilton.)
                            Mr. STEELE spoke in opposition to the motion. He contended that we
                                were without United States Senators, and he wanted a legal
                                representation in that body.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS moved to recommit, with instructions to strike out
                                "separate houses," and insert "convention of the two houses."
                            Mr. WALLACE. Mr. President, I do not design making a speech upon this
                                subject, this morning, and if I had the will, I have not the
                                strength. Still, sir, I occupy somewhat of a singular position, and
                                wish to say something about it. The Senator from Parke (Mr. Steele)
                                once declared upon this floor that before the session was over, he
                                would find a place and a name for me, by which he meant, I suppose,
                                that I had no well defined place, and no clearly defined name. I
                                supposed he meant that he would find that place and that name for me
                                when this question arose. He also intimated that I was afraid to
                                define my position. I beg to assure him that if he has had any such
                                idea, he has mistaken his man. In reference to this election, and to
                                its legality, I will say that I was an active participant in that
                                election, and that is far enough for me to go at this time. At the
                                time this election took place, it was very seriously debated by
                                insiders and outsiders whether it was legal. I was not one who was
                                positive that this election was legal; on the contrary, I admitted
                                that there was a doubt as to its legality. I reasoned this way, sir,
                                and I believe a majority who participated in that election reasoned the same way. We said there is no statute
                                upon our books defining the mode of election - that if we go into an
                                election in this mode we violated no statute. The only law we could
                                find was that under the Constitution of the United States, and the
                                Constitution of the United States in that respect is a good deal as
                                Rufus Choate says of some passages of the Declaration of
                                Independence - glittering generalities, sir. There is nothing
                                positively defined in the Constitution of the United States upon
                                that subject - nothing prescribing the mode of election, and in
                                addition, no law has been passed by the Congress of the United
                                States. We conceived that by electing United States Senators in this
                                mode, we violated no law, as it will inevitably happen that the
                                State, without an election, will have no representative in the
                                Senate of the United States, don't all exigences demand that we go
                                into an election? And then we reasoned further, that if we went into
                                an election, the Constitution of the United States had prescribed
                                the tribunal which should have power to settle the legality of that
                                election, and that was the Senate of the United States. To make a
                                long story short, we resolved to go into an election and let the
                                United States Senate decide whether it was legal or not.
                            Mr. CRAVENS, [interrupting.] I understand the Senator from
                                Montgomery, (Mr. Wallace,) to say that he simply resolved to go into
                                the election of the United States Senators.
                            Mr. WALLACE. We had introduced a resolution to the effect that the
                                Senate would go down into the House for the purpose of the election,
                                and, if my memory serves me well, the Senator, (Mr. Cravens) was one
                                of those who refused to discharge that duty by voting for a motion
                                to lay that resolution on the table; and he and his friends refused
                                to do down - 
                            Mr. CONNER. [Interrupting.] Does the Senator mean to say that, during
                                that session, a resolution was at any time pending in the Senate
                                providing to go to the House for an election of Senators?
                            Mr. WALLACE. Yes sir; but the Republican majority voted that
                                resolution down.
                            The PRESIDENT. They voted to postpone it beyond the day appointed for
                                the election.
                            Mr. WALLACE. Yes, sir; they laid it on the table; but when the day
                                and hour came round the Democratic Senators of this body went down
                                into the House and voted for Jesse D. Bright and Graham N. Fitch,
                                and whether we elected them or not we did what we proposed to do,
                                and that was to refer that legality of the election to the United
                                States Senate.
                            Mr. WAGNER. [Interrupting.] Was not this Joint Convention called in
                                the House, and adjourned over three weeks for the purpose of
                                electing United States Senators before this motion was introduced in
                                the Senate?
                            Mr. WALLACE. The Constitution of the State of Indiana, among other
                                provisions, has one like this: The returns of the election for
                                Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be opened and published in
                                the presence of both Houses. By that provision there was a Joint
                                Convention called - that Convention was the work and creation of the
                                Constitution - it didn't depend upon any action of the Senate or the
                                House - the Constitution called it. It was independent of the Senate
                                or of the House of Representatives. Now, sir, the Senate, in
                                accordance with this provision, on the proper day, went down - we
                                were present - we Democrats; I don't speak for our Republican
                                friends, for I don't believe they were there - many of them; but we
                                Democrats were there in obedience to the Constitution, and we
                                witnessed the opening and publication of the election returns for
                                Governor and Lieutenant Governor. The President, or presiding
                                officer, arose in his place and said the Convention would be
                                adjourned to a certain day - I believe it was three weeks - we can
                                all as certain by reference to the journals.
                            A VOICE, Is that the same Convention that elected these United States
                                Senators?
                            Mr. WALLACE. I understand that was intended to be the same. As far as
                                individual members are concerned who composed it, it was undoubtedly
                                the same joint committee. I see what my Republican friends are after
                                - they want to get me into a debate about the legality of this
                                election; and I have told them I do not intend to say whether it was
                                legal or illegal. [Laughter.] But I do intend to say this: that just
                                as we intended should be done, these Senators went  to Washington, and there the question
                                arose whether they were entitled to their seats as Senators from the
                                State of Indiana. That question involved the question as to the
                                validity of our election. There was a great struggle there over that
                                election - a great diversity of opinion - marvellous travail, even
                                in the United States Senate over it; but at last there came a
                                resolution - positive, from which there can be no appeal, and after
                                which there is to be no further consideration - and by that
                                resolution it was decided that these gentlemen were legally elected
                                that they were United States Senators from the State of Indiana, but
                                went on to point out the definite term which each of those gentlemen
                                should serve - Graham N. Fitch was to hold his seat until 1861, and
                                Jesse D. Bright till 1863. So then this resolution absolutely
                                defines the terms for which these gentlemen shall hold their office.
                                But I will stop here to state that when I voted the other day
                                against a resolution introduced by an honorable Senator, and
                                sustained and passed by Republicans, upon this floor that when I
                                voted "No" upon that resolution, I never intended that vote should
                                be considered either a direct or inderect indorsement of the course
                                of Bright and Fitch upon the Lecompton question.
                            Mr. MARCH [interrupting.] Do you believe they were legally and
                                constitutionally elected United States Senators?
                            Mr. WALLACE. Sir, I have told you that I would not say whether I
                                believed they were legally elected or not. I only know this, that
                                the Senate of the United States have said that they were legally
                                elected.
                            Mr. MARCH. Do you believe they represented the sentiment of the
                                people of the State of Indiana in the last Congress upon the only
                                important question that came up before that body?
                            Mr. WALLACE. I am coming to that point, sir. I do not believe they
                                represented the will of the people of the State of Indiana upon that
                                question; and more than that, sir, I know they did not represent the
                                will of the Democracy of the State of Indiana.
                            A VOICE. Consent
                            Mr. WALLACE. Does anybody doubt that, sir? By referring to the
                                resolutions adopted by the January Convention, I there find a
                                resolution which was directly violated by these gentlemen in their
                                Lecompton course. That resolution was the will of the Democracy of
                                Indiana. It was put there for the purpose of guiding these gen
                                tlemen upon their course, but they refused to heed it. I have gone
                                as far as I intended to go upon this subject.
                            The other day this Senate, shortly after the House of Representatives
                                had done a similar act, saw fit and proper to pass a resolution that
                                Jesse D Bright and Graham N. Fitch were not legally and
                                constitutionally elected Senators of the United States from the
                                State of Indiana. Now, if I were a Republican, as I am a Democrat, I
                                say to you, that I would not hesitate a moment as to what I would
                                do. After having declared they were not legally elected, I would do
                                everything in my power that could be done - anything that could be
                                brought about by my voice or vote - everything would be brought to
                                bear to bring about what I considered a legal election of United
                                States Senators.
                            A SENATOR. They'll do it.Mr. WALLACE. I don't know about that. There
                                seerns to be some bickering in your own household - some trouble
                                about your own hearthstone. But this is what I would do if I was one
                                of them. On the other hand, if I was Jesse D. Bright or Graham N.
                                Fitch, I would be the last man who would throw a straw in your way
                                in bringing that about. Why, if I held a seat as honorable as that
                                of a United States Senator from Indiana, I would never consent to
                                hold it a minute under suspicious circumstances; and if I held it,
                                and any body doubted that my election was legal, I would say, bring
                                on an election and send up the best men you have got; send them up
                                and let us, face to face, contest this election. I would scorn and
                                despise to hold a seat under circumstances that would cause me to be
                                afraid to let you send up your best men to contest the place. And if
                                I am not mistaken, Jesse D. Bright and Graham N. Fitch think as I do
                                upon this subject. In the first place, I imagine that they are not
                                much afraid that any gentleman will oust them, and it may be from
                                that fancied security arises their boldness. I am only speaking of
                                them from what I believe they feel as honorable men nothing more,
                                sir; and to feel any other way, I believe would make them dishonest
                                and dishonorable men.
                            Now, in conclusion, I turn to Republican Senators, and say, whip up
                                your horses, gentlemen, elect your men and send them to the United
                                States Senate, it is possible the United States Senate will vote a
                                    per diem allowance to them; and it is possible
                                that they will have to pay the expenses of the contest out of their
                                own pockets. But I will tell you my opinion now; I don't believe it
                                lies in the bones, much less the souls, of the proud and haughty
                                Senators from the South to turn their backs upon their deliberately
                                formed resolution, and admit the men whom you may send up to the
                                places assigned by the action of the United States Senate to Messrs.
                                Bright and Fitch. I say again, gentlemen, whip up your horses; drive
                                to Washington as quick as you can; raise the question again; see if
                                the Senate of the United States will back down and withdraw their

                                gone into history, and let us see whether or not they will
                                accomplish the principles they assert.
                            After further debate by Mr. MURRAY, taking a rather wide range - 
                            Mr. BLAIR moved to lay Mr. Williams' motion upon the table.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN demanded a call of the house, and there being a second
                                of five, the call proceeded, and the Secretary reported forty
                                Senators present and answering to their names, when further
                                proceedings under the call were dispensed with.
                            A motion to adjourn was now decided by yeas 20, nays 18.

                                        Resolved. That the Committee on County and Township Business be
                                            instructed to inquire whether the expense of assessing
                                            the personal property of this State could not be much
                                            lessened by having but one assessor in each county, with
                                            a deputy or denuties in case of necessity, and whether
                                            the assesment could not be more equal?
                                        And be it further resolved, That said
                                            committee be instructed to inquire into and report to
                                            this House, at as early a day as possible, whether the
                                            real estate could not be appraised by such assessor with
                                            much less expense than by having an appraiser expressly
                                            for that purpose and whether said appraisement would not
                                            probably be done as well?

                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Judiciary be instructed to inquire

                                                become a preferred borrower of the trust funds,
                                                fixing its own time for payment, and the rate of
                                                interest, and what should be the nature of the
                                                obligation on the part of the State, for the payment
                                                of these funds, with interest?
                                            Should the Superintendent of Public
                                                Instruction become fully convinced that the money
                                                raised under the provisions of the second section of

                                                purposes specified in the law, would it be his or
                                                any other person's duty to resort to process in law

                                                for the times above mentioned, would it not be
                                                necessary to enact a new loan bill, defining the
                                                nature of the obligation issued, the amount to be
                                                borrowed, the time of payment, and the rate of

                                                to make the loan, would it comport with section 5,

                            RULES.
                            On motion by Mr. DAVIS, (by unanimous consent) his proposition to add
                                a new rule to the Rules of the House of Representatives,
                                constituting the author of a bill a member, for the time, Of the
                                committee to whom it might be referred, was taken up, and he stated
                                his knowledge of its advantages in the practice of the Senate.
                            Mr. COLGROVE proposed to add a provision that such member should not
                                have the right to vote in the Standing Committee.
                            Mr. SCOTT thought the 38th rule already covered the whole ground. He
                                read the rule.
                            Mr. DAVIS then moved to lay his proposition on the table, which was
                                agreed to.
                            Mr. DAVIS and Mr. STANFIELD had leave of absence till Monday.
                        
                        
                            TRUST FUND.
                            Mr. SNYDER submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That neither of the Trust
                                            Funds of the State, nor any part thereof shall, under
                                            any circumstances, be applied to meet casual deficits in
                                            the revenue.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Which was rejected, on a division, by a tie vote.
                            Mr. COLGROVE submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Sinking Fund be instructed to
                                            inquire into the expediency of the passage of a law
                                            providing for the liquidation of the debt due and owing
                                            from the State to the Sinking Fund, and providing for
                                            the compounding of the interest on said fund, due from
                                            the State to said fund from the date of the loans, and
                                            report by bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. COLGROVE desired to test the sincerity of members who appeared to
                                be careful of these funds. He referred to the vast amount of the
                                indebtedness of the State to these funds, and the $1,200,000 which
                                the fund had lost already for the want of the fostering care of the
                                Legislature. He was prepared to say that every law authorizing the
                                diversion of that fund from the purposes for which it was created
                                was unconstitutional; to establish which opinion he referred to the
                                constitutional provision, and read from the 114th section of the act
                                of 1834, chartering the State Bank, &c., in relation thereto,
                                &c.
                            The resolution was adopted.

                            Mr. DOBBINS submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Agriculture be instructed to inquire
                                            into the expediency of providing for a thorough
                                            geological survey of the State, and that they report by
                                            bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            CLERKS FOR THE AUDITOR.

                                resolution to wait upon the Auditor, to consist of Messrs.
                                Brotherton, Edwards and Row.
                            Mr. EDWARDS obtained excuse, and Mr, Hall, of Rush, was appointed in
                                his place.

                            Mr. HAMILTON submitted a resolution which was adopted, for two
                                additional members of the Committee on County and Township
                                    Business; whereupon
                            The SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Johnston and Harney.
                        
                        
                            NATHAN ROWLEY.
                            Mr. BLYTHE introduced a bill (No. 40) to relieve Nathan Rowley, of
                                Vanderburg county, from damages, in consequence of a certain legal

                                action in which Brackett Mills was complainant and the said Nathan
                                Rowley was defendant, which was passed the first reading.
                        
                        
                            FALSE CERTIFICATES.
                            Mr. BLYTHE introduced a bill (No. 41) to punish the giving of false
                                certificates, and making false and fraudulent appraisements in
                                certain cases therein named, which was passed the first reading.
                        
                        
                            COMMON PLEAS.

                            Mr. JONES, when his name was called, said he would vote in favor of
                                concurring in the report in order to facilitate business.
                            Mr. LINE, when his name was called, said: Mr. President, I refuse to
                                vote, sir.
                            Mr. MILLER, when his name was called, said that he was not in when
                                the report was read, and consequently would not vote.
                            Mr. WEIR, said that he was paired off with the Senator from Allen
                                (Mr. Hamilton) and asked to be excused.So the report of the
                                committee was concurred in.
                            Mr. CRAVENS said that he had paired off, with the Senator from
                                Washington, (Mr. Heffren,) on political questions, aad asked and
                                obtained leave to withdraw his vote from the record.
                        
                        
                            ARGUMENT IN CRIMINAL CASES.
                            Mr. CONNER, from the Judiciary Committee reported
                                that they had under consideration Mr. Murray's bill, (S. 56) to
                                amend section 10.3 of the Law Reform Act, approved June 18, 1852,
                                and that they recommend it be indefinitely postponed.
                            Mr. CONNER said this bill provides that the Prosecuting Attorney
                                shall open and close all arguments in criminal cases, and that the
                                majority of the committee were opposed to it. They contended that
                                the criminal should have the benefit of opening and closing,and of
                                all doubts.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved that the report lay on the tablet but withdrew his
                                motion for
                            Mr. MARCH, who said he did not conceive any change was necessary in
                                the present law, or that it was demanded by the people, or for the
                                administration of justice. I now renew the motion to lay upon the
                                table.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            EMBEZZLEMENT.
                            Mr. RICE, from the Judiciary Committee, reported

                                recommended that it be indefinitely postponed.
                            The report was concurred in.

                            Mr. MARCH, from the Judiciary Committee reported
                                back Mr. Amhony's bill (S 59)
                                amend the third section of an act regulating the licensing of pilots
                                at the Falls of the Ohio, and recommended its passage.
                            The report was concurred in by consent; the bill was read by its
                                title, passed the second reading, and ordered to be engrossed.
                        
                        
                            JURISDICTION OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.
                            Mr. MARCH, from the Judiciary Committee reported
                                that they had had under consideration the resolution of the Senate
                                requiring them to "inquire into the expediency of so amending the
                                Justices Act, as to make the jurisdiction of magistrates, in civil
                                cases, co-extensive with their counties respectively, instead of
                                townships, as the law now exists;" and that they were or opinion any
                                change in the existing law would be inexpedient.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            COURTS OF CONCILIATION.
                            Mr. MARCH from the Judiciary Committee, reported
                                back Mr. Bennett's bill,(S. 61) repealing section 10 of chapter 2 of
                                an act prescribing rules for Courts of Conciliation, approved June
                                11, 1852, and recommended its indefinite postponement.
                            Mr. BENNETT said he was not present at the time the bill was before
                                the committee, and did not like to have it disposed of in that
                                manner. He moved that the report lie on the table, but withdrew his
                                motion for
                            Mr. MARCH, who explained that there was a great deal of business
                                before the committee, and they desired to get through with it; that
                                a majority of the members present were in favor of postponing it,
                                and he had so reported. He renewed the motion to lay on the
                                table.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        

                        
                            LIABILITY OF BOATS.
                            Mr. STEELE, from the Committee on Canals and Internal
                                    Improvements, reported back Mr. Conner's bill (S. 30)
                                to amend the 655th section of an act to revise, simplify and abridge
                                rules, &c., in civil cases, approved June 18, 1852, and
                                recommended its passage.
                            Messrs. Conner, Slack, Wagner, Anthony, Rice and March, were heard
                                briefly upon its provisions, and then - 
                            Mr. CONNER moved that the bill be recommitted to the
                                    Judiciary Committee.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            EMBEZZLEMENT.
                            Mr. BENNETT said he voted for a concurrence in the report of the
                                committee who returned the bill (S. 63) defining embezzlement,
                                simply upon taking the word of some Senator that there was a law in
                                existence upon that subject, but he had since found out that this
                                was a mistake; therefore he moved a reconsideration of that vote,
                                and that the report lie upon the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. WEIR offered the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Judiciary be requested to examine
                                            and report to the Senate whetherthere is any law now in
                                            force in the State providing for the punishment of the
                                            crime of embezzlement, and that  they be instructed to
                                            report a bill providing for the punishment thereof in
                                            the absence of any law now in force.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was rejected.

                                        Resolved, That the Auditor of State be
                                            requested to report to the Senate whether further
                                            legislation is necessary to compel the Free Banks to
                                            reimburse to the State the monies expended in the
                                            General Banking Law of 1855: and whether anything has
                                            been changed or collected against said Banks for 1858,
                                            as provided for in the 14th section of the Act of 1835
                                            to amend an act to authorize the business of
                                            banking.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            PAYMENT OF COSTS
                            Mr. CONNER offered the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on the Judiciary be instructed to inquire
                                            into the expediency of providing by law for the payment
                                            of cost to Justices of the Peace and Constables, in

                            PRINTING OF DOCUMENTS.
                            Mr. WEIR offered a resolution declaring it a useless expenditure to
                                print, in the manner that has heretofore been practiced, the
                                Governor's Message, officers' of State reports, and reports from
                                State Institutions, and that the Committee on
                                    Printing report a law to do away with the same.
                            Mr. MURRAY objected to the resolution, whereupon - 
                            Mr. WEIR withdrew it.

                                a select committee of three; whereupon - 
                            The SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Jeffries, Harrison and Turpie.
                        
                        
                            PUBLIC NOTICE IN A NEWSPAPER.
                            Mr. TURPIE submitted the following report:
                            The Committee on Fees and Salaries, to whom the
                                bill (H. R. 26.) was referred for consideration, have had the same
                                under advisement, and have unanimously instructed me to report the
                                same back, and recommend its indefinite post ponement. The object of
                                the bill is to compel partie who have legal publications to make, to
                                insert them in the newspaper having the largest circulation in the
                                county; and a proceeding is to be instituted before the Board of
                                Commissioners to determine which has the largest circulation. The
                                present law gives a discretion to the officer or person required to
                                give any notice, to select such newspaper as the pleases for that
                                purpose. And your Committee is of the opinion that it is the best
                                way; that the change proposed in the bill would have no good effect
                                which would not be overbalanced by the evils accompanying it. There
                                are many reasons why an officer should be allowed to select his own
                                medium for publication, and not be forced to patronize a press
                                selected for that purpose by the County Board. Besides, the struggle
                                attending the contest for the public printing, would be of a most
                                disagreeable character. The county presses would be in a continual
                                broil and quarrel on the subject. It is true the bill provides that
                                the costs shall be paid by the contesting parties; and as far mere
                                costs were concerned, that provision might answer; but there would
                                be the continual bickerings of the parties, the malevolence of their
                                respective friends; efforts to evade fee lawall expensive in any
                                community, and to beavoided if possible. As to that part of the bill
                                fixing the rates of put lie printing, your Committe already think
                                that matter sufficiently guarded by the free competition prevailing
                                under the present systemthe best of all checks against monopoly or
                                exorbitance.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            STATE PRINTER'S OFFICE.
                            Mr. TURPIE submitted a resolution, (which was adopted) to the
                                following effect:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the select committee on
                                            the subject of the Public printing be directed to
                                            inquire into the transactions in the office of the Srate
                                            Printer during; the terms of the several incumbents of
                                            that office since the period of its creation, relative
                                            to the rates of charges, and the rules and customs which

                                railroads; which was read through and passed to a second
                                reading.
                        
                        
                            COMPENSATION OF EXECUTORS.
                            Mr. HARGROVE introduced a bill (No. 83) [?]xing the compensation of
                                executors and administrators, and repealing the 148th section of
                                chapter 19 volume 2, Revised Statutes, which was read through and
                                passed to the second reading.
                        
                        
                            RAILROAD TAXATION.
                            The Senate now took up the orders of the day.
                            Mr. Miller's bill (S. 5) to
                                amend the 32d section of an act providing for the valuation and
                                assessment of real and personal property, approved June 2l, 1852,
                                was read through the third time.
                            Mr HENDRY explained that it is the intention of this bill to provide
                                a remedy to those counties having tracts of land put in as railroad
                                stock, and no taxes collected from them because the railroad does
                                not run through the county.
                            Mr. MILLER was afraid the bill does not yet fully reach the object
                                for which it was introduced.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved that it lay upon the table until this was
                                ascertained.
                            The motion was agreed to.

                                towns in this State, was read through the third time
                            Mr. SHOEMAKER stated that this bill was intended to reach a
                                particular case, although it was general in its character.
                            A constitutional provision demanding the yeas and nays, they were
                                ordered, and being taken, resulted - yeas 44, nays 1.
                            So the bill was passed.
                            The title was read and adopted.

                                    Agriculture and it was so referred.

                                second time.

                            COUNTY CLERKS AND DEPUTIES.
                            Mr. Cooper's bill (S 76) to prohibit County Clerks and their Deputies
                                from practicing as attorneys at law in the courts in which they are
                                employed, and Treasurers from practicing in any court, was read
                                through the second time.
                            Mr SLACK moved its reference to the Judiciary
                                    Committee, and it was so referred.

                                was read through the second time.
                            Mr. BOBBS moved its reverence to the Committee on

                            The files being clear.
                            On motion, the Senate took a recess till two o'clcck.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The special order for this hour, viz: Mr. Murray's resolution for the
                                abolishment of the Court of Common Pleas, comining up for
                                consideration - 
                            Mr. McLEAN moved that it be postponed till Tuesday next, two o'clock,
                                and made the special order for that hour.

                                The next special order was then considered, viz: Mr. Hargrove's
                                    bill (S. 28) providing
                                    the manner of the election of United States Senators. The
                                    question being on Mr. Blair's motion to lay on the table Mr.
                                    William's motion to recommit the bill to the Judiciary
                                        Committee with the following instructions:
                                Strike out the words "separate Houses," and insert the words
                                    'Joint Committee of the two Houses "
                                The bill was read through by the Secretary.
                                Mr. SLACK moved a call of the Senate, and there being a second,
                                    the call was proceeded with, and the Secretary reported
                                    forty-seven Senators as present and answering to their names -
                                    Messrs. Carnahan, Wallace and Wilson being absent.
                                Mr. MARCH said that Mr. Wilson was called before the Grand Jury
                                    of the United States.
                                Mr WAGNER said that Mr. Carnahan would be back in a few minutes;
                                    that he had only gone to his boarding house for something.
                                Mr. WEIR said that Mr. Wallace had been compelled to go home
                                    sick, and asked that he be excused.
                                Mr. RICE said that he had agreed to pair off with the Senator
                                    from Montgomery (Mr. Wallace) on political questions.
                                Mr. TURNER moved that further proceedings in the call be
                                    dispensed with.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                The yeas and nays being demanded on the motion to lay on the
                                    table, they were ordered, and being taken, resulted - yeas 27,
                                    nays 19.
                                So the motion was not agreed to, and the question recurring on
                                    Mr. Williams' motion - 
                                Mr. GOODING said that if all that part of the bill which relates
                                    to the legality of Bright and Fitch's election were striken out
                                    he would vote for the bill, but he did not intend, by any vote
                                    of his, to declare that they are either legally or illegally
                                    elected.
                                Mr. CARNAHAN moved that the Senate resolve itself into a
                                    Committee of the Whole on this bill.
                                The motion was agreed to, and the Senator from Vigo, (Mr. McLean)
                                    being called to the Chair, the consideration of the bill
                                    proceeded in Committee of the Whole.
                                Mr. President HAMMOND. Mr. Chairman, I move that the sixth
                                    section of this bill be stricken out.
                                The motion being entertained by the Chair -
                                
                                Mr. HAMMOND proceeded at length to give his reasons for the
                                    amendment proposed.
                                Messrs. Murray, Heffren, March and Steele, continued the debate.
                                    When they had concluded - 
                                Mr. LINE moved that the committee rise, report progress and ask
                                    leave to sit again.
                                The motion was agreed to, the committee accordingly rose, and the
                                    Chairman reported that they hid not time to come to a
                                    conclusion, and asked leave to sit again
                                The report was concurred in by unanimous consent, and then
                                The Senate adjourned.

                                away with the ink scroll, seal, &c., in which they request the

                            APPRAISEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.
                            Mr. BRANHAM, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                                reported back the bill (S. 3)
                                for the appraisement of real estate, &c., proposing an amendment
                                of the 13th section thereof, so as to require the Appraiser, on or
                                before the first Monday in May next, after his appointment or
                                election, to make and deliver to the County Auditor a written

                                taxation in his county; and when so amended, they recommend its
                                passage.
                            Mr. STANFIELD. This is one of the most important bills of the
                                session. I have not yet had an opportunity to examine it
                                sufficiently, and I move that it lay upon the table and be made the
                                special order for to-morrow at two o'clock.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the order made accordingly.

                            Mr. BOYD, from the Committee on Education,
                                reported back Mr. Stanley's bill (H. R. 22) with the expression of opinion that it was in
                                conflict with article 4, section 21 of the Constitution of the
                                State, and reporting a substitute therefor, entitled An Act to
                                provide for the reappraisement and sale of school lands in cases
                                therein mentioned.
                            Mr. BOYD explained that the bill was designed to meet a single case
                                of unsold school lands in Noble county, which had been valued too
                                high for sale.
                            Mr. PROSSER moved to strike out the publication clause.
                            Mr. STANFIELD, making a point of order, moved to recommit the bill
                                with instructions to the committee to report their substitute by way
                                of amendment.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            RECORDER'S FEES.
                            Mr. SCOTT, from the Committee on Fees and
                                Salaries, returned Mr. Boyd's bill (H. R. 7) to amend
                                section 3 of the act to provide for the election and prescribing the
                                duties of County Recorders, &c.. recommending indefinite
                                postponement, and expressing the opinion that legislation on the
                                subject is inexpedient.
                            Mr. BOYD explained that the only provision in this bill was that the
                                Recorder may demand his fees in advance. He, and others with him
                                were instructed to procure the passage of such an act. A man should
                                not be compelled to labor for naught.
                            Mr. SCOTT justified the report. The committee saw no reason for
                                legislating partially in this way, in favor of Recorders, any more
                                than constables, clerks, &c.
                            Messrs. Baird, Nebeker of Warren, and Dougherty, spoke in favor of
                                the bill, and then - 
                            On a division, the House refused to concur in the report of the
                                committee - affirmative 34, negative 40.
                            Mr. COLGROVE moved to rofer thn bill to a select committee of five,
                                with instructions "to authorize the Recorder to make a general index
                                of the records of deeds, mortgages, &c., in his office, and
                                allowing him ten cents per hundred words therefor," which he
                                supported in a speech.
                            Messrs. RYNERSON and AUSTIN opposed the instruction.
                            Messrs. MELLETT and DOBBINS read the existing statutes on the subject
                                of Recorder's compensation, thinking the existing law
                                sufficient.
                            Mr. DURHAM proposed to amend by instructing the committee to insert a
                                clause by which justices of the peace and clerks of the Courts may
                                demand their fees in advance.
                            Mr. BLYTHE saw no propriety in requiring the public at large to pay
                                for this index He moved to amend the instructions, by adding
                                authority to the committee "to inquire into the expediency of
                                authorizing the Recorder to demand and receive an extra fee of five
                                cents on each instrument recorded by him - to be paid by the party
                                offering the same for record."
                            Mr. PARKS saw no reason for taxing the County Treasury for making
                                this index. The forms of deeds, &c., were so short, that one
                                dollar was enough for both record and index.
                            Mr. SCOTT spoke at length against increasing the compensation of this
                                officer.
                            Mr. MERRIFIELD was in favor of the bill, but opposed to the several
                                proposition to in struct the committee. He was opposed to increasing
                                the fees of this officer, until they were found insufficient, and
                                when found insufficient, he would make the fee larger, &c.
                            Mr. PROSSER moved to lay the motion to refer on the table.
                            Mr. DAVIS proposed to amend the motion by adding, "the bill also"
                            The amendment was agreed to - yeas 52,nays 41 - and the question
                                recurring on laying the whole subject on the table - 
                            Mr. MURRAY and another demanded the yeas and nays, and the same being
                                ordered, and taken, resulted - yeas 52, nays 42 - as follows:

                            Mr. DOBBINS submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Banks be instructed to inquire into the
                                            expediency of so amending the present Banking system of
                                            the State as to prevent the issue and circulation of
                                            bills of a less denomination than $5; and also to
                                            prevent the circulation of bills of less than a similar
                                            denomination in this State from other States, and that
                                            said committee be permitted to report by bill or
                                            otherwise.

                            Mr. COLGROVE submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Roads and Highways inquire into the
                                            expediency of so amending the Road Law as to abolish
                                            districts in incorporated towns, and place the
                                            road-working in each incorporated town under the
                                            immediate supervision of the town council, and report by
                                            bill or otherwise.

                            Mr. Speaker GORDON submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved That the Committee on the
                                            Judiciary be instructed to inquire - 
                                        
                                            Whether the General Assembly has power by
                                                law to reduce the width of the Michigan Road?
                                            2. Whether the State is under legal
                                                obligation, by treaty with the Indians or otherwise,
                                                to keep said road in repair, and if so, whether such
                                                obligation does not require that a bridge should be
                                                built across White River, where said road crosses
                                                the same in the county of Marion?
                                        
                                        And that they report the result of such inquiry at as
                                            early a day as possible.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            STATE TAX.
                            Mr. MILLER submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved. That the Committee
                                                on Ways and Means are hereby directed to
                                            inquire into the expediency of so amending our
                                            Assessment Law as to make it necessary only for Auditors
                                            of counties to place the amount of State tax levied in
                                            an aggregate column, instead of as at present placing
                                            the amount assessed for Benevolent Institutions, Sinking
                                            Find, &.C., in separate columns.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. M. stated that he had offered the same resolution yesterday, and
                                it was rejected. He was satisfied that the single county of
                                Tippecanoe, since 1852, had paid its Auditor $1,200 for this single
                                service. As there was no law on the subject, he desired to prevent
                                such impositions upon the County Commissioners.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY OFFICERS' FEES.
                            Mr. DUVALL submitted the following, which was rejected:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Fees and Salaries be and they hereby
                                            instructed to report a bill, without unnecessary delay,
                                            providing for the reduction of the fees of the Clerks of
                                            the Circuit Courts in this State, of the sheriffs.

                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry, submitted a resolution which was adopted, to the
                                following effect:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the respective
                                            Superintendents of the Benevolent Institutions of the
                                            State, be directed to inform this House, at soon as the
                                            facts can be obtained, relative to the cost, per capita,
                                            of supporting persons in similar institutions in other
                                            States of the Union setting forth such information in
                                            tubular formshowing the cost of general management,
                                            subsistence, clothing, &c., and also the character
                                            and value of the labor performed in such
                                            institutions.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            TOWNSHIP BUSINESS.
                            Mr. DUVALL submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on County and Township Business be
                                            instructed to report a bill, without delay, providing,
                                            among other things,
                                        
                                            A reduction of the township expenses
                                                three-fourth, by reducing the number of Trustees to
                                                one.
                                            By providing that said Trustee shall have
                                                the management and direction of the public schools
                                                in his township, and receive for his services in
                                                full not exceeding $1 50 per day.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. AUSTIN proposed to amend, by substituting "three" Trustees
                                instead of "one"dispensing with the Clerk and Treasurer, which was
                                rejected.
                            Mr. HUNTER proposed to substitute - "report a bill abolishing the law
                                on the subject of Township Business."
                            Mr. COLGROVE said he had offered such a resolution, and it was now
                                before the committee.
                            Mr. HUNTER withdrew his proposition.
                            Mr. DAVIS. As he understood the gentleman from Boone, the object was
                                to simply get an expression of opinion of the House as to the manner
                                of changing the mode of doing township business. It would be folly
                                for the committee to report, without something to guide them.
                                Thousands had been uselessly expended under the present system,
                                &c.
                            Mr. PROSSER was in favor of changing the system, but opposed to
                                making the same man actuary and treasurer, making drafts on himself,
                                &c. He preferred to retain two trustees.
                            Mr. SCOTT opposed the resolution. It was "better to bear the ills we
                                have, than fly to others we know not of."
                            Mr. DOBBINS was in favor of the resolution, supposing the object was
                                to transfer much of the township business to the County
                                Commissioners, &c.
                            Mr. COLGROVE said this was an important question, and he reviewed
                                late legislative action on this subject of the mode of doing
                                township business. There was a report made to the last General
                                Assembly on this subject, based on a resolution which he introduced.
                                The expense of township business in this State for the year 1856,
                                was enormous. He did not propose to fly to ills we know not of. He
                                proposed factslandmarks for our guidance, &c.
                            Mr. DUVALL now proposed the following substitute for the
                                resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on County and Township Business be, and
                                            they are hereby authorized to report a bill, at an early
                                            day, providing for doing away with the present mode of
                                            doing township business, and providing in its stead a
                                            cheaper svstemone that will not cost over one-third of
                                            the amount of the present system.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            A MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
                            A Senate message by Mr. Vawter, their Secretary, announced, the
                                passage, in that body, of the
                                bill (S. 20 ) to authorize
                                associations for building towns; and the bill (S. 59) to amend section 3 of
                                the act regulating pilots of the Falls of the Ohio, approved June
                                15, 1852, asking the committee of the House of Representatives.
                            Mr. AUSTIN was opposed to the resolution. Changes in legislation were
                                always attended with expense. The expense of our township business
                                had been heavier than it would be for the future. Expenses would be
                                curtailed. He pointed out the inconveniences of the change proposed.
                                He preferred to abolish the township clerk and treasurer's office,
                                and to curtail the terms of sessions of the boards of trustees. When
                                he had concluded - 
                            The House took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The Senate met pursuant to adjournment.

                            
                                COMMON PLEAS IN BARTHOLOMEW.
                                On motion by Mr. COLLIER, the bill (S. 31) to change the time
                                    of holding the Court of Common Pleas in Bartholomew to the
                                    second Mondays in February, May, August and November, was taken
                                    up and passed the first reading.
                                On his further motion, the bill was read again by title, and
                                    passed the second reading.
                            
                            
                                TOWNSHIP BUSINESS.
                                The House now resumed the consideration of Mr. Duvall's
                                    resolution of this morning, the question being on the adoption
                                    of Mr. Duvall's substitute.
                                Mr. MURRAY took the floor in opposition to the resolution,
                                    speaking generally against the tendency of the minds of
                                    gentlemen to tear away and destroy existing systems without
                                    proposing anything more desirable. The people were more directly
                                    interested in the administration of township business, and the
                                    argument against the system was that it was too expensive; but
                                    he felt secure in any system so completely in the hands of the
                                    people. He suggested amendment , such as to dispense with the
                                    Clerk and Treasurer - requiring their duties to be performed by
                                    the Board of Trustees; and then limiting the terms of their
                                    sessions to one day in three months. There was the least
                                    possible danger of these Boards levying too heavy a tax. He
                                    replied to objections to the system, and pointed out
                                    difficulties in the way of placing township business in the
                                    hands of the Board of County Commissioners. In his region, the
                                    County Boards were already overburdened with business. Again,
                                    our township boards were inspectors and judges of elections. How
                                    would gentlemen hold the elections, or locate school houses,
                                    when they had abolished these boards? What would become of the
                                    administration of the free school system? Under the present
                                    system, the township boards charged nothing for this oversight
                                    of the schools, except the enumeration of the children.
                                Mr. EDWARDS demanded the previous question, but withdrew for - 
                                Mr. DAVIS, who desired to hear from the Chairman of the Committee
                                    on County and Township Business.
                                Mr. HARRISON did not desire to occupy time, and preferred
                                    directness in legislation. The resolution proposed an inquiry,
                                    not only jnto the propriety of abolishing the present system but
                                    also to inquire in what it may be improved. The present was a
                                    system of too much machinery - too much fiction - too many hands
                                    in the treasury - too many contingencies. The same might be said
                                    of the entire machinery of the State Government. The system we
                                    threw away for the present.was a much better one He thought it
                                    would be advisable to retain but one township trustee. One would
                                    be sufficiently and safely restrictedand there would be more
                                    efficiency than with the business in the hands of three or five
                                    men. He would take the road business out of the hands of men who
                                    were interested, and place it in the hands of the County
                                    Commissioners, who would be more free from the bias of interest,
                                    &c. He replied to Mr. Murray, and set forth his own views in
                                    particular.
                                Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone, also replied to Mr. Murray. Both his
                                    colleague and himself came up here pledged to support some
                                    proposition to improve the mode of doing township business. The
                                    resolution was to authorize the committee to devise a cheaper
                                    mode of doing township business.
                                Mr. MELLETT confessed that he did not understand our township
                                    system. It was complicated, uncertain, and impossible to
                                    administer as it was doubtless intended to be administered many
                                    features in it had been held unconstitutional. He proposed not a
                                    better system himself, but he had confidence in the Chairman of
                                    the Committee on County and Township Business, and believed he
                                    would be able to report a system which would not require a man
                                    to travel over the State to explain it. He also replied to Mr.

                                            can be given by any other law on the subject.

                                impression that the Legislative Sentinel would
                                print one sided reports of the proceedings of this body; but as many
                                gentlemen were of the opinion that he was too hasty in his
                                conclusions in obedience to the request of several Senators, and in
                                order that we may have further

                                    would yield for a motion to adjourn to seven o'clock
                                    to-night.
                                He moved the previous question, but there was not a second.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER moved to recommit with instructions that the
                                    committee inquire into the constitutionality of that section,
                                    which makes it a criminal offence if certain officers don't
                                    perform certain duties.
                                Mr. BENNETT moved to lay the motion on the table.
                                Which was agreed to.

                                So the bill passed.
                                The title was then read, when
                                Mr. CRAVENS moved an amendment to the title, but immediately
                                    withdrew it.
                                Mr. HEFFREN moved to amend the title as follows:
                                "An act to provide for the selection of two persons to make a
                                    pilgrimage to the City of Washington for the purpose of showing
                                    the folly of the Legislature of the State of Indiana, and
                                    exhibiting their own ignorance of law; with the further hope
                                    that they can get mileage and per diem therefore."
                                Mr. MURRAY moved to lay amendment on the table,
                                Mr. KINLEY moved to amend the amendment bv inserting in the
                                    proper place ''the Legislature of 1857."
                                This motion was rejected.
                                The yeas and nays were demanded on the motion to lay Mr.
                                    Heffren's amendment on the table, and being ordered and taken,
                                    resulted - yeas 32, nays 12.
                                So the amendment was laid on the table.

                                And then the Senate adjourned.

                            Mr. RYNERSON, from the Committee on Agriculture,
                                to whom was referred the resolution with reference to the authority

                            Mr. TREADWAY, from the Committee on Agriculture,
                                to whom was referred the joint resolution of the House, concerning a
                                grant of public lands for agricultural colleges, reported the same
                                back, proposing to strike out from the resolution all that refers to
                                United States Senators, and recommended its adoption as so proposed
                                to be amended.
                            Mr. TEBBS, from the same committee, submitted a minority report, in
                                the following terms:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Agriculture, to whom was referred the
                                            joint resolution to instruct our Senators and request
                                            our Representatives in Congress to go for a grant of
                                            land for agricultural colleges, are not opposed to
                                            instructing our Senator, and recommend the passage of
                                            the original joint resolution.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY moved ineffectually to lay the report of the majority
                                of the committee on the table.
                            Mr. DOBBINS moved indefinite postponement of the majority report.
                            Which motion was lost, by yeas 42, nays 50 and the question recurred
                                on concurrence.
                            Mr. HARNEY was opposed to all such propositions, going to the General
                                Government for aid to build up public institutions, upon the belief
                                that we are able to take care of ourselves, and the General
                                Government have as much as they can do to get along; and he moved to
                                lay on the table, but withdrew for - 
                            Mr. DAVIS, who, being sustained in his position on the Senatorial
                                question, by the highest Whig authority (the National
                                Intelligencer,) expressed his opposition to the report of the
                                majority of the Agricultural Committee. He thought political
                                questions ought not to be mixed with our agricultural interests.
                            Mr. RYNERSON gave a reason for the report.
                            Mr. GIFFORD, believing we are legally and constitutionally
                                represented in the Senate of the United States, would amend the
                                report so as to include them.
                            Mr SCOTT renewed the motion to lay on the table, for the reasons
                                submitted by Mr. Harney.
                            Mr. WATERMAN and another demanded the yeas and nays, which being
                                ordered, and taken, resulted - yeas 69, nays 22 - as follows:

                                Indiana; to amend the first section of the 8th article, and repeal
                                section 8 of the 8th article.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Wayne, introduced a bill (No. 60) to amend the 6th
                                section of the act providing for the organization of County Boards,
                                and prescribing some of their duties, approved June 17, 1852.
                        
                        
                            PETIT JURIES.
                            Mr. BLYTHE introduced a bill (No. 61) prescribing the manner of
                                empanneling petit juries, and fixing the number and compensation
                                thereof.
                            Which bills were severally passed the first reading.
                        
                        
                            POWERS OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.
                            The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of bills on the
                                third reading; and Mr. Stile's bill (H. R. 18) to amend section 18
                                of the act prescribing the powers and duties of Justices of the
                                Peace in State prosecutions, coming up - 
                            Mr STILES said the act of 1852 empowers the Justice to commit the
                                party upon his failure to pay his fine, but not on failure to pay
                                the coats. The bill proposes to amend that act, so that upon failure
                                of the parry to pay the fine and costs, he shall stand
                                committed.
                            The yeas and nays being taken thereon under the constitutional
                                provision, the result was - yeas 81, nays 7 - as follows:

                            So the bill was passed the third and last reading in the House of
                                Representatives.

                            Mr. Clement's bill (H. R. 19)
                                to secure the service of process in actions on corporations created
                                by the General Assembly of this State which have no office in the
                                county, &c , coming up - 
                            Mr. HARNEY moved to recommit the bill with instructions to strike out
                                the emergency clause. These clauses were infractions of the
                                Constitution - abuses of privilege.
                            Mr. CLEMENTS showed the existing emergency, in cases pending in the
                                Circuit Court of his county, wherein parties ought to have some sort
                                of service for the February term.
                            Mr. HARNEY withdrew the motion.
                            The bill was then passed the third and last reading in the House of
                                Representatives by yeas 91, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            Mr. Branham's bill (H. R. 28) prescribing the time, place and manner
                                of election of United States Senators, coming up - 
                            Mr. DOBBINS moved to recommit the bill with instructions to strike
                                out the emergency clause.
                            It would seem to him that gentlemen would weary with the declaration,
                                that the State of Indiana was not represented in the Senate of the
                                United States. He was in favor of a law on this subject; but, to say
                                here, that the State of Indiana was not represented in the Senate of
                                the United States, was to make a declaration contrary to the fact
                                and the judicial record. He rehearsed the manner of the election of
                                Bright and Fitch, and defended the legality thereof; alleging that
                                it was revolutionary to make the declaration here that it was not a
                                legal election, &c. When he had concluded - 
                            Mr. SCOTT moved to lay on the table - but gave way and withdrew the
                                motion for - 
                            Mr. PARRETT, who complained that a minority of the Judiciary
                                    Committee had no part in making the report on the
                                pending bill. He represented his position to the question of the
                                legality of the election of our Senators in Congress. With reference
                                to the regularity of that election, he submitted, that all elections
                                of this class prior to 1852 were made is conformity to law on the
                                Statute book. But that statute was repealed in 1852. What law or
                                what precedent could we have on that subject in Indiana? He then
                                proceeded, at length, to rehearse the history of the election of
                                1857, which was imposed, as a duty, on that Legislature by the State
                                Constitution. With reference to the declarations of gentlemen, who
                                would be glad, if they had the power, to remove Messrs. Bright ami
                                Fitch, he supposed those gentlemen might be glad to displace every
                                Democrat. The fact of their voting in conflict with the views of
                                gentlemen could have nothing to do with any effort here to displace
                                them. For if the rule was good, it might unseat members of this
                                House, for voting, and perchance they might, against the views of
                                their constituents. It was revolution - nothing but revolution. If
                                Bright and Fitch have done wrong, at the proper time, the wrong
                                could be legally corrected by the election of others to succeed
                                them. But the question of their expulsion from the Senate of the
                                United States belonged to another forum

                        INDIANAPOLIS, DEC. 12, 1858.
                        No. 12.
                    
                    
                        
                            whose authority, attempted to be exercised here, was blank
                                usurpation. It was a judicial decision which had given these
                                Senators their seats - to which point he read Cushings' Legislative
                                Law. The harmony of this Union was worth too much to be frittered
                                away in such a manner.
                            Mr. DAVIS proposed to recommit the bill, with instructions to strike
                                out the 6th section and insert:
                            "SECTION 6. That whereas there is no law now in force for the
                                election of United States Senators, it is the opinim of this General
                                Assembly that an emergency exists for the immediate taking effect of
                                this act, therefore the same shall take effect and be in force from
                                and after its passage."
                            He considered, and submitted to the friends of the proposition, that
                                to put this declaration in here would do no good. He condemned the
                                report by the Republicans of the last Legislature, to the
                                revolutionary proceedings referred to; but no man more richly
                                deserved the consequences of such proceedings than one of these
                                Senators.
                            Mr. Speaker GORDON interposed We were never asked to go into joint
                                convention. It was done without even a formal request.
                            Mr. DAVIS. No doubt the gentleman was right but still the duty
                                remained. Why did they fail to propose any law?
                            Mr. GORDON. The scheme of the members of the Democratic party was
                                consummated before we had an opportunity to do so.
                            Mr. DAVIS. The gentleman looked upon it as a void proceeding, and the
                                duty of enacting the law yet rested upon him. He replied to the
                                reference which the gentleman from Warrick had made to his position
                                on this question. He alleged that our Senators, by their course on
                                the Kansas question, had enacted a fraud upon the doctrine upon
                                which they held their places. He proceeded at some length to define
                                his position to the question involved, which was sustained by a
                                sense of duty and of right, and to deprecate action here upon a
                                matter which must result in nothing but a waste of the public time.
                                When he had concluded - 
                            The House took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            On motion of Mr. BLYTHE, Mr. Burnham's bill (H. R. 28) was postponed
                                till to-morrow 2 o'clock.

                            
                                APPRAISEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.
                                The SPEAKER, announced the special order, viz: Thy consideration
                                    of the bill (S. 3) to
                                    provide for the appraisement of real estate, and prescribing the
                                    duties of officers in relation thereto; the question being: on
                                    engrossment - 
                                Mr. STANFIELD proposed to amend the third section by striking out
                                    all after the word "lots," in the 4th line, and inserting the
                                    following words: "Railroads and their superstructures, plank
                                    roads, turnpikes, McAdamized roads, and canals, except the
                                    Wabash and Erie Canal, and toll bridges belonging to private
                                    individuals and private corporations."
                                The amendment was adopted.
                                On motion of Mr. EDWARDS, the House resolved itself into
                                    Committee of the Whole - Mr. Edwards in the Chair - and pursued
                                    the consideration of the bill by sections.
                                Mr. KELLY proposed to amend the first section by striking out the
                                    fourth line, and inserting: "Shall appoint the necessary number
                                    of appraisers, not exceeding ten in number in each county, and
                                    shall assign to the several appraisers their several
                                    districts."
                                Mr. RYNERSON proposed to amend the amendment by striking out
                                    "some suitable pe son," and inserting, "three suitable persons,
                                    one residing in each County Commiosioner's district, in each
                                    county, as appraisers."
                                Mr. CLEMENTS moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                                The CHAIRMAN. There is no rule, in committee, to lay on the
                                    table. The vote must be direct.
                                Mr. BRANHAM. The bill gives the Commissioners power to appoint
                                    deputies, as many as they want.
                                Mr. RYNERSON'S amendment was rejected.
                                Mr. DUNHAM proposed "one for each township," which was rejected;
                                    and then - 
                                Mr. KELLY S amendment was rejected.
                                Mr. DOUGHERTY proposed to strike out the words "the County
                                    Auditor," and insert "the Board of County Commissioners."
                                Which was agreed to, and then the resolution was adopted.
                                The section 2 being read by the Clerk - 
                                Mr. KELLY proposed to amend, by striking out and inserting:
                                "SECTION 1. At the annual election in October, 1863, and every
                                    five years thereafter, three persons shall be elected by the
                                    people of each county, one of whom shall reside in each
                                    commissioner's district, and shall reside in their respective
                                    districts as designated by the commissioners, who shall, after
                                    the 1st day of January, thereafter, proceed to discharge his
                                    duty as required by law."
                                The amendment was rejected.
                                Mr. BLYTHE proposed to strike out "five" and insert "three"
                                    (years,) which was rejected.
                                Section 3 being read by the Clerk - 
                                Mr. JORDAN proposed to insert the words "or elected," after the
                                    word "appointed," which was adopted.
                                Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren, proposed to strike out Mr. Stanfield's
                                    amendment to the third section, which was adopted by the
                                    House.
                                Mr. STANFIELD doubted whether the motion was in order, but (the
                                    Chair entertaining it) he proceeded to say: This was a bill for
                                    the appraisement  of real
                                    property. He desired the law should apply to all real property.
                                    The proper policy, he thought, was to tax all corporeal things -
                                    not the mere representatives of them. We know that the law of
                                    1852 taxes corporate property, especially railroad property, and
                                    we know that not more than one-half of such property is brought
                                    out for taxation. This was evident from the Auditor's report. He
                                    gave numerous instances in support of this statement.
                                Messrs. Nebeker, of Warren, Parks, Baird and Harney were in favor
                                    of striking out.
                                The committee refused to strike out.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON proposed to insert the words, "or elected,"
                                    after "appointment" in the third line.
                                Which was agreed to.Mr. DOBBINS proposed to amend the 4th
                                    section, by inserting the words "or elected," alter the word
                                    "appointed," (appraiser, &c.)
                                Which was agreed to.
                                Mr. SULLIVAN proposed a similar amendment in the fourth line,
                                    which was agreed to.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON proposed a similar amendment in the second
                                    line, which was agreed to.
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON moved, effectually, to strike out the proviso
                                    of the 5th section.
                                Mr. WATERMAN proposed to strike out and insert appropriately in
                                    the 5th section, these words: "the book containg said list shall
                                    contain blank columns, in which the appraiser shall set down the
                                    valuation put on each tract or parcel of land," which was
                                    rejected.
                                Mr. STANFIELD proposed to amend the 6th section, by inserting
                                    after the word "situation, and before the word "provided," in
                                    the eleventh line, the following words:
                                The said appraiser shall also, on actual view, make a true
                                    valuation of all lands used or held by railroad companies for
                                    road-bed, station-grounds, gravel pits, switches and side
                                    tracks, and all railroad tracks, depot buildings and other
                                    superstructions thereon, according to the same rule herein
                                    provided for ascertaining the value of other real property; and
                                    he shall, in the same manner, make a true valuation of all
                                    McAdamized roads, plank roads, turnpike roads and canals, other
                                    than the Wabash and Erie Canal, and also all toll bridges
                                    belonging to private persons or private corporations.
                                Which was adopted.
                                Mr. ROBINSON proposed to amend the 9th section, by adding:
                                    "Provided that there shall he deducted from the land owned by
                                    any person - as shown by the deed or survey, the amount of the
                                    same occupied by any railroad, canal, or public highway," which
                                    was adopted.
                                Mr. AUSTIN proposed to amend the 12th section by striking out
                                    these words: "with the consent of the owner or occupant thereof,
                                    and fully examine," which was rejected.
                                Mr. DOUGHERTY proposed to amend by striking out fiom the last
                                    line of the 12th section the word "taxes," and inserting in lieu

                                    day,] which was rejected.
                                Mr. MILLER proposed $3 per day, which was rejected.

                                    Appraiser, when called upon therefor, shall be deemed guilty of
                                    a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof shall be fined in
                                    any sum not less than five dollars nor nore than five hundred
                                    dollars.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to amend the amendment, by inserting after
                                    the word "person" the word "company or corporation," which was
                                    agreed to:
                                And then the amendment, as amended, was rejected
                                Mr. DOUGHERTY proposed to amend this section by striking out
                                    "fifty," and inserting "twenty five" [per cent. to the value of

                                    clause repealing sections 33, 34, 35 of an act to provide for

                                    the State of Indiana; for the election of tax assessors and
                                    appraisers, and prescribing the duties of County Auditors and
                                    County Treasurers, and of the Auditor and Treasurer of State,
                                    approved June 21, 1852 - sections in conflict with the
                                    amendments above recommended by the committee of the whole, in
                                    sections 3 and 5.
                                The amendment was adopted.
                                Mr. DOUGHERTY. Mr. Chairman, the 1st section provides for the
                                    appointment of appraisers, and the 2d section provides for the
                                    election of appraisers by the people. But the Board of
                                    Commissioners are to appoint the Deputies. I move to reconsider
                                    the vote adopting the first section, to enable me to offer an
                                    amendment.
                                The vote was reconsidered.
                                Mr. DOUGHERTY then proposed to amend the 1st section by striking
                                    out the proviso, and inserting these words: "Said appraisers
                                    shall have power to appoint deputies, who shall take the same
                                    oath required of their principals, to be endorsed on their
                                    certificate of appointment."
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON proposed to amend the amendment by adding
                                    after the word "Appraisers" the words, "and such as maybe
                                    elected under the provisions of this act," which was
                                    adopted.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to amend further by adding, "with the
                                    approval of the County Commissioners," which was rejected.
                                After debate by Mr. Scott aud Mr. Murray in opposition to the
                                    amendment - 
                                Mr. SNYDER proposed further to amend by adding a proviso, "that
                                    the County Commissioners shall name four persons from whom the
                                    Appraiser shall select his Deputies if necessary, which was
                                    rejected.
                                Mr. Dougherty's amendment, as amended, was adopted.
                                Mr. BAIRD proposed [out of order] "that this Legislature shall
                                    now appoint the Appraisers."
                                Mr. MERRIFIELD moved to reconsider the vote adopting the 25th
                                    section, so as to enable him to propose an amendment allowing
                                    five copies of this act to each Appraiser instead of one copy,
                                    which motion was rejected.
                                
                                An then, on motion of Mr. MURRAY, the Committee rose, and the
                                    Chairman reported these several amendments to the House,
                                    recommending their adoption, and asking that the Committee be
                                    discharged from further consideration of the subject.
                                The report of the Committee of the Whole was concurred in, and
                                    the amendments were ordered to be engrossed
                                .The House then adjourned.

                            Mr. STUDABAKER asked and obtained consent to take from the table bill
                                (S. 44.,) providing for the organization of a Board of Sinking Fund

                                    on Education, and it was so referred.

                            Mr. HEFFREN moved that messages from the House be taken from the
                                table. The motion was agreed to, and the bill (H. R. 18) to amend
                                section 18th of an Act prescribing the powers and duties of Justices
                                of the Peace, approved May 29,1852, was read through, and passed to
                                the second reading.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.

                                and the other business as recommended by the Governor's Message, be
                                acted upon and disposed of, was read.
                            The resolution was rejected.

                                the service of process in actions against corporations having no
                                offices doing business in towns in which they are located, was read
                                through and passed to the second reading.
                        
                        
                            REPEAL OF THE LIQUOR LAW.
                            The bill (H. R. 23,) repealing
                                the Liquor Law, approved Feb. 16, 1855, was read through the second
                                time.
                            Mr. CONNER moved its reference to the Committee on
                                    Temperance, and it was so referred.
                        
                        
                            DESCRIPTION FOR TAXATION.
                            Mr. Studabaker's bill (S. 80,) supplementary to the law reform act,
                                approved June 21, 1852, was read through the second time.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER moved its reference to the Judiciary

                            SUPREME COURT REPORTER.

                                the election of a Supreme Court Reporter, approved February 5, 1852,
                                was read through the second time.
                            Mr. HENDRY moved its reference to the Judiciary Committee, and it was
                                so referred.
                        
                        
                            RAILROAD LIABILITY.
                            Mr. Conner's bill (S. 82) to amend section 1 of an act to provide
                                compensation to owners of animals killed or injured by railroads,
                                was read through the second time.
                            Mr. CONNER moved its reference to the Judiciary
                                    Committee, and it was so referred.
                        
                        
                            COMPENSATION OF EXECUTORS.
                            Mr. Hargrove's bill (S. 83) fixing the compensation of executors and
                                administrators, and repealing the 148th section of chapter 10, vol.
                                2 of the Revised Statutes of 1852, was read through the second
                                time.
                            Mr. HARGROVE moved its reference to the Finance
                                    Committee, and it was so referred.
                        
                        
                            MISDEMEANORS.
                            Mr. Slack's bill (S. 84) to repeal section 51 of an act defining
                                misdemeanors, approved June 14, 1852, was read through the second
                                time.
                            Mr GOODING moved its reference to the Judiciary
                                    Committee, and it was so referred.
                        
                        
                            PAPER CURRENCY.
                            Mr. Heffren's bill (S. 85) to prohibit the circulation of unsafe
                                paper currency, was read through the second time.
                            Mr. McLEAN offered the following amendment.
                            "Strike out all that portion of the bill declaring the making,
                                issuing and circulating of unauthorized currency a felony,
                                punishable by imprisonment in the State's Prison."
                            Mr. HEFFREN advocated the passage of the bill, for the purpose of
                                preventing the people of the State from being swindled. He was
                                opposed to any and all banks, as an original proposition, and never
                                would vote to establish them; and had he the legal and
                                constitutional power so to do, he would sweep every one from the
                                State - but we have not the power; and, therefore, he was willing to
                                submit to the protection of vested rights in banks as well as
                                others.
                            Mr. WEIR moved as an amendment to the amendment, the following: 
                            "That it shall be a felony punished by imprisonment in the State
                                Prison, not less than two years, for any person or persons, or
                                officers of any bank or banks to refuse to redeem their currency on
                                presentation."
                            Mr. STUDABAKER. This bill does not go far enough; unauthorized paper
                                currency should be suppressed.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN believed it was an important bill. He moved that it lay
                                on the table, and one hundred copies be printed.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                            Mr. WEIR and Mr. McLEAN obtained leave to withdraw their
                                amendments.
                            Mr. BLAIR from the Committee on Banks, by
                                unanimous consent, reported back Mr. Conley's bill (S. 36)
                                prohibiting the issue of unauthorized paper currency; recommending
                                that it be laid on the table; and submitting an entire new bill
                                    (S. 86) in lieu
                                thereof.
                            Mr. Blur's bill (S. 86) to
                                enable the holders of unauthorized paper money, to collect the
                                amount thereof from any person, company or corporation heretofore or
                                hereafter issuing or aiding in the issue or circulution therof; was
                                read through the first time.
                            And then the report was concurred in by consent.
                            Mr. ANTHONY moved that the rules be suspended,  and that the bill be read the second
                                time now.
                            A constitutional provision requiring the yeas and nays, they were
                                ordered, and being taken, resulted - yeas 45, nays 0.
                            So the bill was read the second time by its title.
                            Mr. ANTHONY moved that the bill lie on the table, and one hundred
                                copies be printed.
                            Mr. CRAVENS. This bill is upon a matter about which there can be such
                                small variety of opinions that he objected to putting the State to
                                the expense of printing it, as it would only delay the final
                                passage.
                            Mr. ANTHONY would not permit any person to go farther than he in
                                opposition to this kind of paper currency. The bill does not go far
                                enough.
                            Mr. BOBBS was willing to vote for the infliction of almost any
                                penalty upon the violators of the proposed act, but thought that
                                something less than the crime of felony, as proposed, would answer
                                all purposes.
                            Mr STEELE agreed with the Senator from Jefferson (Mr. Cravens) that
                                the printing of the bill will only delay the matter. He was willing
                                to go as far as any Senator to put down this shin-plaster
                                currency.
                            Mr. ANTHONY withdrew his motion to print.
                            Mr. WEIR, under a wrong impression of the provisions of the bill,
                                renewed his motion to print; but upon finding this out, withdrew it
                                before he took his seat. In answer to an interrogatory by Mr.
                                Gooding, he stated: When the question comes up for the repeal of the
                                charter of the Bank of the State of Indiana I will vote "aye."
                            Mr. MURRAY moved the reference of the bill to the Judiciary
                                    Committee, which was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            ENCOURAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
                            Mr Lomax's bill, (S. 63) to amend an act for the encouragement of
                                Agriculture, approved February 7,1855, was read the third time.
                            Mr. ANTHONY moved to recommit, with instructions to strike out
                                "forty," and insert in lieu thereof, "seventy-five" [acres of land
                                may be held by Agricultural Societies.]
                            Mr. WAGNER moved that the committee consist of three, in order that a
                                report may be had immediately.
                            Mr. ANTHONY accepted, and his motion was agreed to.
                            The President appointed Senators Anthony, Wagner and Lornax said
                                committee.
                        
                        
                            SWAMP LANDS.
                            Mr. Turner's bill (S. 68) to amend sections 20, 28, 32 and 51 of the
                                Swamp Land Act, approved May 29, 1852, was read through the third
                                time.Mr. TURNER explained that this bill simply changes the
                                appointing of Swamp Land Commissioners from the Governor to the
                                County Commissioners.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER moved to recommit the bill to the Swamp Land
                                Committee, with instructions to the effect that the Swamp Land.
                                Commissioners be required to give bonds.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            ENCOURAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
                            Mr. ANTHONY from the select committee, (this hour appointed) obtained
                                leave to submit the following report:
                            MR. PRESIDENT - The select committee to whom was referred Senate Bill
                                    (No. 60) "A Bill to amend

                                amendment, have directed me to report the said bill back, amended as
                                follows: Amend the second section by striking out the word "forty,"

                                the bill pass.
                            The report was concurred in by consent.
                            The bill was read by its title, and the question being, Shall the
                                bill pass?
                            A constitutional provision demanding the yeas and nays, they were
                                ordered, and being taken, resulted - yeas 42, nays 2, as

                                for the third reading.
                        
                        
                            UNAUTHORIZED PAPER CURRENCY.
                            Mr. MELLETT, from the Committee on Banks, returned
                                Mr. Martin's bill (H. R. 9) to prevent the circulation of
                                unauthorized paper currency with the proposed amendments,
                                recommending that the amendments be laid on the table, and the bill
                                amended by striking out all after the enacting clause, and inserting
                                seven sections - 
                            
                                That any and all bills, bonds, notes, &c., issued by
                                    any company, corporation, or association in this State, either
                                    in the form of certificate, promise to pay, &c., made in the
                                    similitude of bank notes for the purpose of being used as a
                                    circulating medium, shall be held and deemed fraudulent and
                                    void.
                                Shall be a misdemeanor, and the party, on conviction,
                                    shall be fined not less than $100, nor more than $1,000, and be
                                    imprisoned not exceeding six months.
                                Failure to redeem shall be a separate and distinct
                                    offense, deemed a misdemeanor, and fined not less than the face
                                    of the paper issued nor more than double that amount, to which
                                    may be added imprisonment, and so on.
                            
                            The report was concurred in.
                            On motion by Mr. BAIRD, the bill was laid on the table, and made the
                                special order for Monday, two o'clock.
                        
                        
                            A MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE
                            A Senate message announced their non-concurrence in the joint
                                resolution to adjourn the session next Monday; also, the passage of
                                a bill (S. 4) to amend the 6th, 7th, 10th. llth, 12th, 15th, 19th
                                and 20th sections of the Divorce Act, approved May 13, 1852; and a
                                bill (S. 28) prescribing the
                                time, place acd manner of election of United States Senators, fixing
                                penalties, &c., in which they respectfully request the
                                concurrence of the House of Representatives.
                        
                        
                            SMALL NOTES.
                            Mr. SCOTT, from a majority of the Committee on
                                    Banks, returned Mr. Dobbins' resolution of inquiry
                                into the expediency of suppressing the circulation of bank notes of
                                a less denomination than $5, with the expression of opinion that
                                legislation on the subject would be inexpedient.
                            Mr. BOWMAN, from a minority of the Committee on
                                    Banks, reported the expression of opinion that if
                                small bank bills were prohibited, it would have the effect of
                                drawing out the coin into circulation, and so entirely prevent those
                                numerous small note frauds upon the currency.
                            Mr. DAVIS moved to refer these reports to the Committee on
                                    the Judiciary, with instructions to inquire into the
                                power of the Legislature over the currency in this respect. If it
                                have the power, he subscribed to the doctrine of the minority of the
                                committee. The exercise of the power he thought clear in the case of
                                the Free Banks, but over the Bank of the State doubtful.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            DIVORCE LAW.
                            Mr. BLYTHE, from the select committee to whom was referred Mr.
                                Colgrove's bill (H. R. 5) to amend the Divorce law, reported the
                                same back with amendments, striking out sections 2 and 3, and
                                adding:
                            "SECTION - That the third clause of section of said act. namely,"
                                'Absence for one year, or for a less period if the Court should be
                                satisfied that a reconciliation is improbable,' be so amended as to
                                read: 'Third, abandonment for one year.'"
                            The report was concurred in. The question now being, Shall the bill
                                be engrossed for a third reading - 
                            Mr. BLYTHE. The first section of the bill provides for an alteration
                                in the present law. The present law does not require any given time
                                of residence in the county or State, prior to filing application for
                                a bill of divorce. This section provides that there shall be a
                                residence of one year. To that, the committee make no amendment. The
                                second section of the bill is to repeal the second clause of the
                                seventh section of the Statute, on page 235 of the second volume of
                                the Revised Statutes, in these words: "Or any other cause for which the Court shall
                                deem it proper." The purpose of the original bill is to repeal that
                                clause. The committee instruct me to report against the propriety of
                                repealing that clause. From some examination, I have found that this
                                clause has run through all our divorce laws from the earliest
                                period, giving the Courts this discretionary power. There are
                                numerous cases in which it is emiently proper that the Court sould
                                interfere, which cannot be reached by statute. The third section of
                                the bill is the emergency clause. the committee think there is too
                                great hast to put bills in force, in violation of the spirit, if not
                                the letter of the Constitution. With reference to the additional
                                section, the committee simply wish to take away the discretion of
                                the Court in the 7th section of the act, which this is to amend.
                            Mr. CLEMENTS proposed to recommit the bill, instructing the committee
                                to report a bill repealing all laws authorizing divorces to be
                                granted in this State, and providing a reasonable support for wives
                                abandoned by their husbands! [Laughter.]
                            Mr. DAVIS. I believe we have a rule to prevent a member from voting
                                on a proposition in which he is immediately interested. Under that
                                rule I move that the gentleman from Boone and the gentleman from
                                Harrison, be excused from voting on this question.
                            Mr. JORDAN. I believe I have never been divorced, Mr. Speaker.
                            Mr. DAVIS. But every divorce case increases his chance to get a
                                wife.
                            Mr. Clements' instructions were rejected.
                            Mr. MURRAY. I move to recommit with instructions to "strike out one
                                year in regard to residence, and insert two years;" and on that I
                                demand the yeas and nays.
                            The House rejected the motion by yeas 25 nays 70
                            Mr. AUSTIN moved to re-commit with the following instructions: "to
                                set forth all the causes for which divorces may be granted." - Mr.
                                A. said he was satisfied the passage of this bill would not meet the
                                expectations of the people in the east part of the State. They were
                                much dissatisfied with the present law of divorces. It had made our
                                State a sort of Gretna Green, by leaving this discretion as to the
                                time of residence. He was for making the law more stringent. He
                                would particularly take away the option of the Court the very
                                portion of the law which the report of the Committee proposes to
                                retain. Want of definite and specific language in the laws was a
                                great objection, and he would have the causes of divorce made most
                                specific and definite - not left loose, to invite abuses of the law.
                                If he could control this matter he would never authorize a
                                divorce.
                            Mr. ROBINSON moved to lay the subject on the table.
                            The motion was lost.
                            Mr. COLGROVE was opposed to recommitment. He concurred with Mr.
                                Austin on the general principle, but had never observed any abuse of
                                the discretion of the Court under this seventh section. He hoped the
                                bill would ve organized now, and moved to reject the
                                resolutions.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. CLEMENTS proposed to recommit with instructions to amend, by
                                adding a provision "that no divorce shall be granted when the case
                                originated in another State, unless by the laws of such' other State
                                a divorce is authorized to be granted."
                            Mr. SCOTT proposed to substitute the instructions as follows:"To so
                                amend the clause in the 7th section as to read For any cause which
                                the Court shall deem a fraud upon the marriage contract."
                            Mr. BLYTHE opposed recommittrnent, and supported the report at
                                length, replying to Mr. Austin and others.
                            Mr. AUSTIN replied.
                            Mr. GRIFFIN demanded the previous question, and under its operation,
                                Mr. Scott's instructions were rejected; and then Mr. Clement's
                                instructions were rejected by yeas 32, nays 64, as follows:

                                A MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
                                A message from the Senate announced the passage there of a bill
                                    to amend the act authorizing  Agricultural Societies to purchase and hold real estate, and
                                    requested the concurrence of the House of Representatives.
                            
                            
                                LEGALIZING ACKNOWLEDMENTS.
                                The SPEAKER, announced the order of bills On the third reading,
                                    and Mr. Blythe's bill (H. R.
                                        38,) legalizing the acknowledgment of all deeds,
                                    mortgages and other instruments required to be certified since
                                    the reception of the Revised Statutes of 1852, coming up, it was
                                    passed the third and last reading in the House of
                                    Representatives by yeas 74, nays 12.
                            
                            
                                JUDGMENTS AGAINST SHERIFFS, &C.
                                The Judiciary Committee's bill (H. R. 39) regulating the
                                    collection of judgments and sale of property against officers or
                                    persons holding money in a fiduciary capacity, coming up - 
                                Mr. DAVIS. Is there not a Statute to that effect?
                                Mr. MELLETT. It does not cover the whole ground.
                                The yeas and nays (under the constitutional provision) resulted -
                                    yeas 96, nays 0 - so the bill passed the third and last reading
                                    in the House of Representatives.
                            
                            
                                NATHAN ROWLEY.
                                Mr Blythe's bill (H. R. 40) for the relief of Nathan Rowley
                                    (against a judgement for $445, to be paid out of the general
                                    school fund,) coming up - 
                                Mr. COLGROVE supported the bill from his knowledge of it derived
                                    from an investigation of the case two years ago.
                                Mr. BLYTHE set forth the claim of Mr. Rowley, many years a School
                                    Commissioner of Vanderburg county, its merits and history at
                                    length.
                                Mr. STILES, learning that this matter had been before a jury, and
                                    so decided that Mr. Rowley was indebted to the School Fund to
                                    the amount of $445, he felt no disposition to go behind the
                                    verdict of a jury.
                                Mr. EDWARDS was willing to rely on the statement of the gentleman
                                    from Vanderburg, which was entirely satisfactory.
                                Mr. DOBBINS made a statement corroborating that of Mr. Blythe.
                                    The vote of the House on this claim two years ago, was 64 in the
                                    affirmative, and 20 in the negative.
                                Mr. MELLETT criticised the grounds of the claim, which were based
                                    on the individual carelessness of the claimant, who was thus
                                    left without a remedy at law. It was his opinion that the State
                                    ought to have the same judgment in the case that should be
                                    awarded to an individual. The case was settled, and the
                                    Legislature was not a court of appeals.
                                Mr. BAIRD sustained the claim upon a plea of equity, a plea which
                                    was always good with an honest creditor, and therefore it ought
                                    to be good here.
                                Mr. Blythe, Mr. Mellett, and Mr. Stiles were heard again.
                                Mr. DAVIS might vote against this claim, if the county of
                                    Vanderburg, most interested in the fund to be affected by it,
                                    had not come up here and reported that injustice had been done
                                    in a case where the County Board have not the power to enter
                                    satisfaction upon the record. It was a naked question of right
                                    and justice.
                                Mr. HALL of Rush, should vote against the bill on the principle
                                    that a man can not take advantage of his own error.
                                Mr. CLEMENTS supported the claim.
                                Mr. DAVIS demanded the previous question, and under the operation
                                    thereof, the bill was passed the third and last reading in the
                                    House of Representatives, by yeas 60, nays 33.

                                Mr. Hunter's bill (H. R
                                    43) to authorize the transfer of church property where a
                                    union of churches is formed, and a new name assumed, &c.,
                                    coming up, the bill passed the third reading in the House of
                                    Representatives, by yeas 87, nays 0.

                                    requesting our Representatives in Congress to use their
                                    influence to obtain an appropriation for the construction of a
                                    canal around the Falls of the Ohio river, coming up - 
                                On motion by Mr. EDWARDS, it was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                APPRAISEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.
                                The Speaker announced the consideration of bills from the Senate
                                    on third reading, and the bill (S. 3) to provide for the reappraisement of real
                                    estate, and prescribing the duties of officers in relation
                                    thereto, coming up, the engrossed copy was read through by the
                                    Clerk.
                                The SPEAKER ordered the yeas and nays on the third reading of the
                                    bill, according to the constitutional requirement.
                                Mr. PARKS made an ineffectual application for unanimous consent
                                    to amend the bill by engrossed order, adding to the 15th section
                                    the following:
                                "Provided the County Commissioners of any county may, in their
                                    discretion, authorize the appraiser so appointed or elected,
                                    during the time he may he engaged in such appraisement, to keep
                                    an office,and to make such appraiser a reasonable allowance
                                    therefor out of the County Treasury."

                                    resolution tendering the use of the Hall to-morrow night for a
                                    lecture by the Hon. Henry Walker.
                                
                                Mr. PROSSER proposed to amend by including the Hon. John D.
                                    Hopkins.
                                On motion by Mr. THOMPSON, of Madison, the matter was laid on the
                                    table.
                                The House then adjorned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            FRIDAY, December 10, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read.
                        Mr. STEELE, from the Committee on Finance, responding
                            to a resolution of tbe Senate, reported that there is no law authorizing
                            County Treasurers to assess property omitted by the regular assessor,
                            but that the law governing County Auditors is sufficient to enable that
                            officer to correct the errors of assessors, which was concurred in.
                        Mr. MARCH, from the same committee, reported the following joint
                            resolution, which was I passed the first reading.
                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS, There are in the hands of the Attorney General for
                                        collection, certain claims in favor of the State of Indiana
                                        against Allen May, endorsed by Michael G Bright and James P.
                                        Drake; and WHEREAS, the Attorney General, in answer to a
                                        resolution of the Senate, has reported to that body that "he
                                        has received repeated assurances; from the above parties
                                        that they are willing to adjust and settle said claims in
                                        such manner as the Legislature may direct:" therefore,
                                    Be it Resolved by the General Assembly if the
                                            State of Indiana, That the Attorney General be
                                        instructed to proceed immediately to collect said claims by
                                        due process of law, unless the amount due thereon is
                                        faithfully paid to the Treasurer of State, or secured to his
                                        satisfaction; but nothing in this joint resolution shall be
                                        so construed as to release any officer or person through
                                        whom said claims have been derived, from any liability for
                                        the payment of the amount due thereon.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. CRAVEN, from the same committee subimitted a report recommending the
                            indefinite postponement of the bill fixing the compensation of executors
                            and administrators, which was laid on the table.
                        Mr. BENNETT, from the Judiciary Commitee, submitted a
                            report recommending the indefinite postponement of the bill amending an
                            act for the election of Supreme Court Reporter, providing for the speedy
                            publication of the Supreme Court reports, &c., which was concurred
                            in.
                        Mr. CONNER, from the same committee, reported an amendment to the bill
                            providing compensation to the owners of animals killed by railroad
                            companies, which was laid on the table.Mr. MURRAY, from the same
                            committee, submitted a report recommending the passage of Mr. Anthony's
                            bill amendatory of the practice act, which was concurred in.
                        Mr. MARCH, from the same committee, submitted a report recommending the
                            passage of the bill amending the act defining misdemeanors, which was
                            concurred in.
                    
                    
                        CONVENTIONAL INTEREST.
                        Mr. SLACK, from the Judiciary Committee, submitted a
                            report recommending the indefinite postponement of the bill repealing
                            the 51st section of an act defining misdemeanors.
                        [This bill makes the rate of interest merely nominal, and does away with
                            all punishment for taking interest at a rate greater than 6 per
                            cent.]
                        Mr. SLACK said the majority of the committee had instructed him to make
                            that report, but he should oppose it, and hoped it would not be
                            concurred in.
                        Mr. WAGNER was for free trade in money as in everything else.
                        Mr. CONNER was in favor of the report. If we had usury laws, they should
                            be enforced.
                        Mr. LINE said if as much interest was allowed in Indiana as in Ohio,
                            capital would flow into it. He knew a great deal of Indiana capital that
                            had sought investment in Ohio.
                        Mr. CARNAHAN thought we had better be money lenders than money borrowers.
                            Legalize a larger rate of interest and labor would cease in proportion.
                            He was for a low rate of interest believing we should have more
                            productive labor with low interest than with high interest.
                        Mr CRAVENS said he knew of capitalists in Kentucky who would gladly
                            invest their money in Indiana if they could do so with profit and
                            safety. He would like to see a modification of the present interest
                            laws.
                        Mr. HENDRY was in favor of altering the present interest laws. Banks and
                            brokers took a larger rate of interest than was allowed by law under the
                            systens of bills of exchange. They could do this while the poor man with
                            a few hundred dollars to loan could not take this advantage. He was for
                            putting all money lenders on a level. He was opposed to bank monopolies,
                            and would vote, as the Senators from Laporte and Hancock had declared
                            they would vote, to repeal the charter of the Bank of the State of
                            Indiana - that gigantic fraud - at any time the monster could be
                            reached.
                        Mr. MARCH agreed with the Senator from Posey that labor was first to be
                            protected, and if there was to be a struggle between capital and labor
                            it was the duty of the legislature to discriminate in favor of labor.
                            The question could not be properly disposed of until the rate of
                            interest was fixed.
                        Mr. MURRAY said we should look at this matter in the light of an
                            agricultural and commercial interest and not in the light of a specutive
                            interest. The question to be answered was: could we afford to pay a
                            greater rate of interest than six per cent? He thought the Legislature
                            should discourage the spirit of speculation, and give encouragement to
                            the productive interests of the country.
                        Mr. SLACK said the question was not to increase the rate of interest, but
                            to remove the heavy penalty for taking a higher rate than six per cent,
                            in cases agreed on by contracting parties. If a penalty should be
                            imposed on one party for taking a high rate of interest, a penalty
                            should also be imposed on the other for agreeing to pay a high rate.
                        Mr. BOBBS concurred in the views expressed by Mr. Carnahan. The policy of
                            the State was to encourage labor. He should vote to concur in the
                            report.
                        On motion by Mr. LINE, the report was laid on the table.
                        Mr. WAGNER, from the Committee on Education, reported
                            an amendment to the assessment law of 1852, which was concurred in, and
                            the bill was ordered to be engrossed.
                        Mr. MARCH, from the Judiciary Committee,  submitted a report in favor of the passage
                            of the bill supplemental to the assessment law of 1852, which was
                            concurred in, and the bill was ordered to be engrossed.
                        In accordance with a resolution adopted yestrday, the Senate now
                            adjourned till Monday 2 o'clock.

                            absence for this day) is debtor to Mr. Jones, of the Indiana State Journal, for his notes embracing the foregoing
                            report.]
                    

                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            FRIDAY, December 10,1858.
                        
                        
                            PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
                            Mr. DAVIS, by unanimous consent, took some notice of a writer in the
                                    Indianapolis Journal, charging him with an
                                incautious statement that the 15th section of the act creating the
                                Bank of the State of Indiana, provided that it should be taxed as
                                other moneyed institutions. This question had been raised by the
                                Branch in his town - whether stock tax should not be listed against
                                individual stockholders. It was the opinion of Judge Howe, that they
                                should. This was also Mr. Davis' opinion. Whoever had $100 in money
                                or notes, was assessed on that amount. But the bank with a capital
                                of $100,000 could issue notes to the extent of $150,000; why then
                                should not the bank be taxed on its discounts, notes, bills and
                                moneys on hand? There was injustice in the present assessments.
                        
                        
                            INSANE HOSPITAL.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House the petition of Charles T. Noble,
                                of Franklin township, Marion county, which was read and referred to
                                the Committee on Benevolent Institutions. It is

                                submitted a report on the finances and debts of the State, of which

                            Your committee in considering the propriety of levying a tax for the
                                present year, were naturally led to examine into the financial
                                condition of the State, in connection therewith. Which they have
                                done, so far as they were enabled, by the reports of the Auditor of
                                Slate, and submit the following, as the result of their labors:

                            Which estimates of the Auditor, your committee, at present, are not
                                prepared to say are correct, but they will be able to give the House
                                full information on the subject so soon as they can complete their
                                present investigations.
                            Mr. BLYTHE moved that the report be laid on the table, and 1,000
                                copies printed.
                            Mr. MARTIN moved 200 copies, which was lost.
                            And then Mr. Blythe's motion prevailed.
                            Mr. MANSFIELD had leave to record his vote on the passage of the
                                appraisment bill yesterday He voted in the affirmative.
                        
                        
                            ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATOR.
                            Mr. BAIRD, from a majority of the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary, to whom was referred Mr. Harney's bill (H.
                                R. 37) to provide for the time and manner of electing United States
                                Senators, returned the same, and recommended its indefinite
                                postponement"the majority of said committee believing that a bill
                                now before the House for the same purpose, and which has received
                                the sanction of this committee, contains a better plan for the
                                election of such Senators than the one under consideration."
                            Mr. TURPIE, from a minority of the same committee, submitted a report
                                recommending the engrossment of the bill. The minority say:
                            "We wish expressly to dissent from that part of the report of the
                                majority stating that a better bill upon the subject is already
                                before the House. On the contrary, we are of the opinion that the
                                bill herewith returned is much fairer in all its provisions than the
                                one referred to by the majority.
                            "It has been the law and uniform usage of this State, and most of the
                                States of the Union, to elect Senators by joint ballot in a
                                Convention of both branches of the Legislature, as provided for in
                                the present bill, and we think the reasons urged for a change in
                                that particular, and for the enactment of a law as recommended by
                                the majority, are of such a nature that they commend themselves to
                                the politician rather than the statesman. The method by which we
                                shall select those who are to represent the sovereignty of the State
                                in the Senate of the Union, is certainly a question which should
                                exclude the consideration of poli ical differences and engage the
                                unbiased, disinterested attention of all. A law for that purpose
                                shou d be the deliberate expression of sentiment of those engaged in
                                the duties of legislation, suited and adapted to all times and
                                occasionsnot the result of a momentary excitement, elicited by an
                                emergency really without existence. and manufactured to order. It
                                should be the measure of neithet one party or another, but a measure
                                of justice to all." 
                            
                            Mr. TURPIE demanded the yeas and nays on concurrence in the majority
                                report. But,
                            On the motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the subject was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY LINES
                            Mr. PARKS, from the Committee on County and Township
                                    Business, returned the bill (H. R. 34) to amend the
                                second section of the act approved March, 7, 1857, to authorize new
                                counties, change county boundaries, &c., recommending indefinite
                                postponement.
                            Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren, gave examples of abuses under the provisions
                                of the act of 1857, here proposed to be amendedthat act of 1857
                                providing ior the transfer of territory from one county to another,
                                on petition to the County Board, without the consent either of the
                                people of the county from which it is taken, or of the county to
                                which it is to be at attached.
                            On motion by Mr. TURPIE, the report was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            AUDITOR'S CLERKS.
                            Mr. BROTHERTON, from the Select Committee, to inquire whether clerks
                                were necessary in the State Auditor's office, reported the
                                following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Auditor of State be
                                            allowed to employ such additional assistance in his
                                            office - not exceeding two clerks - as will enable him
                                            to respond to resolutions of the House of
                                            Representatives, requiring him to report the several
                                            amounts of money which have been paid to the several
                                            State officers.

                                Superintendent of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, responding to the
                                resolution of Mr. Smith, of Perry, as to the conduct and cost of
                                management of similar institutions in other States of the Union,
                                which was received, and, without reading,
                            On the motion of Mr. HARNEY, it was laid on the table, and 200
                                hundred copies ordered to be printed.

                            Mr. MARTIN submitted the following, which was adopted by consent:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committe on
                                                Banks be instructed to inquire into the
                                            expediency of prohibiting the banks in the State from
                                            taking or receiving, either directly or indirectly, by

                                        Resolved, That all engrossed bills,
                                            before they are put upon their final passage, shall be

                                        Resolved, That the Committee

                                            into the fact as to whether there is such an office as
                                            Public Printer in the State of Indiana, and report at

                                        Resolved, That upon a motion to
                                            adjourn, when question is tabled thereon, or an

                                            Journal the exact time of day the motion was made.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                             LICENSE LAW.
                            Mr. DURHAM introduced a bill [No. 64] to regulate the sale of
                                spiritous liquors. [A quart law.]
                            Mr. MANSFIELD introduced a bill [No. 65,] to license, regulate and
                                restrain the sale of spiritous, malt and intoxicating liquors, to
                                prevent drunkenness and crime; prohibit the adulteration of liquors,
                                and repeal all acts conflicting with this act. Which bills were
                                severally passed the first reading.
                            Mr. SHOCKLEY, from the Committee on Temperance,
                                returned various resolutions of the House, directing inquiries into
                                the expediency and constitutionality of a license law, and reported
                                that the committee entertain no doubt of the constitutionality of a
                                license law, but holding it to be morally wrong to make the State a
                                partner in any evil work. They report the expression of opinion that
                                the enactment of a license law would be inexpedient at this
                                time.
                            Messrs. Murray and Hunter demanded the yeas and nays on
                                concurrence.
                            Mr. DAVIS. For the sake of giving an opportunity to come fairly upon
                                the record, I move to recommit the subject, with instructions to
                                report a well regulated license law.
                            Mr. AUSTIN said the committee had given the subject due
                                consideration, and there was a difference of opinion. But the
                                committee could not, under its present organization, report a
                                license law. They concur that a license law would be inexpedient.
                                They also could concur in a law inflicting heavy penalties for
                                violations of a restrictive law. There might be a minority report.
                                From this the instructions of the gentleman from Floyd were
                                manifestly improper. He could not respond to such instructions.
                            Mr. DAVIS. Committees were not constituted so much to promulge their
                                own views, as to carry out the will of the House. This was one of
                                the great objects in the constitution of all committees. The
                                instructions were not disrespectful to the committee.
                            Mr. AUSTIN had said it was impossible for the committee now to
                                harmonize, so as to present such a bill as the gentleman had
                                indicated.
                            Mr. DAVIS. Let the House express its will, and then the way of the
                                committee would be clear. He would deal with this traffic as a great
                                evil, and treat it as such. Why not make it pay a part of the
                                expense it would superinduce? The extreme friends of temperance had
                                tried their hands, and lost, instead of gaining ground. He replied
                                to the objection to making money out of evil doing. It was just as
                                good morality in the case of intemperance, as in assault and
                                battery.
                            Mr. MANSFIELD explained the views of the minority of the committee.
                                All would restrain intemperance, but differ about the means. It was
                                useless to legislate on moral subjects, which could be better affected by
                                public opinion. The prohibition should not be against the use, but
                                the abuse of liquors. We have learned by prohibitory laws the
                                impossibility of legislating directly with success against this
                                traffic. The minority would recommend, it we cannot kill, to cripple
                                the monster. They proposed a license law with proper regulations and
                                restrictions.
                            Mr. MARTIN proposed to amend the instructions so as to read as
                                follows:
                            "To report a bill as nearly conforming to the constitutional portion
                                of the Liquor Law of 1853, as practicable.
                            Mr. SCOTT looked on this as the most important question of the
                                session, and therefore moved to lay the subject on the table until
                                we could get a bill such as indicated by the chairman of the
                                committee (Mr. Austin,) but withheld the motion for - 
                            Mr. DAVIS, who preferred a direct expression on a license law
                                now.
                            Mr. COLGROVE. That expression might as well be given now as at any
                                time. He was opposed to a license law, on the principle that the
                                traffic was wrong; but since the traffic was an evil we could not
                                get rid of, we ought to restrict it. He admitted the correctness of
                                the position of Mr. Davis, that penalty should fall upon crime, but
                                from this there could be no inference that the State should form a
                                partnership, and become responsible for an evil which all
                                acknowledge. The silver of Judas might as well be appropriated for
                                the benefit of the Christian Church. Penalty could be added and
                                enforced without granting a license. You sell under regulations,
                                which, if you violate, you shall suffer the penalty.
                            Mr. MURRAY proposed to amend the instruction, by adding, provided
                                they could not agree on any other proposition, &c., which was
                                laid on the table.
                            Mr. SCOTT renewed, ineffectually, his motion to lay on the table.
                            Mr. MURRAY explained his position. He was in favor of a license law
                                if we could not get any other. He was a Temperance man, ready to
                                vote for the best law to put down drunkenness, &c. He should
                                probably refuse to vote on this question.
                            Mr. HALL, of Rush, submitted considerations agaiast a license
                                law.
                            Mr. POWER should refuse to vote if placed in a position where he
                                could not vote for anything but a license law.
                            And then, under the force of the previous question, the vote on Mr.
                                Davis' instructions resulted - yeas 64, nay 31, as follows:

                            Mr. EDWARDS introduced a bill (No. 66) to amend section 5, and repeal
                                section 10, of the act entitled An Act to provide for a Board of

                                State of Indiana, approved May 28, 1852, and constituting the County

                                    for a report from the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means.

                                    72] entitled an Act for the permanent establishment of a Board

                                    office, and compensation; the safe keeping and disbursement of

                                MR. SPEAKER: — In reporting a Bill for the permanent
                                    establishment of the "Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners;" for
                                    the providing of means to meet the current expanses of the
                                    State, and the interest on its foreign debt; for the safe
                                    keeping of its revenues; and for other purposes designated in
                                    the Bill — the Committee on Ways and Means
                                    have directed me to make the following explanations:
                                This Bill was framed under a peculiar state of circumstances, and
                                    to provide for the urgent wants of a Treasury nearly exhausted.
                                    It is wholly different, in outline and detail, from that which
                                    would have been presented by the committee, had the Treasury
                                    been full. The first object in view was the providing funds, by
                                    the 24th of this month, sufficient to pay the interest on our
                                    foreign debt maturing on the first of January nest, and to
                                    preserve intact the credit and honor of the State. It was
                                    evident that a loan could not be effected abroad in the
                                    intermediate time, even if a foreign loan was regarded as
                                    preferable to one obtained at home. The only fund within our
                                    reach, ample for our purpose and peculiarly subject to our
                                    control, is that designated in this Bill. On examination of its
                                    resources and of its relations to the State, it became obvious
                                    that a reliance on its means and its management, until the
                                    revenues of the State were deficient for its curret wants, and
                                    for the repayment of sums taken from this and other Trust Funds,
                                    would be advantageous, not only to the State itself, but also to
                                    each and all of these Trust Funds.
                                The withdrawal of all money from the hands of the Treasurer is
                                    evidently expedient while the State is compelled to pay interest
                                    on an open account — a suspended debt, or rather an unavailable
                                    investment of nearly $85,000, to be deducted from cash balance
                                    in the Treasury on the 31st of October. 1858 as reported by the
                                    Treasurer and Auditor, further admonishes us of the expediency
                                    as well as the honesty of paying our debts, or any portion of
                                    them when we have the money in hand — and the payment of a
                                    certain and liberal salary to that officer, instead of an
                                    allowace of perquisites of uncertain amount and of a character
                                    liable to suspicion, is certainly most to the dignity of the
                                    State and the usefulness of its servant.
                                It wiil be borne in mind that under the 113th section of the Act
                                    establishsng the State Bank of Indiana and the Sinking Fund, the
                                    Commissioners of this Fund have no power is distribute any
                                    portion of its means for school purposes until the purchase and
                                    cancellation of the bank bonds has been effected. All the
                                    increment of the fund has been, and for the next two years, at
                                    least, must be invested in bonds, certificates, mortgage notes,
                                    or other securities. It is, then, submitted that no security can
                                    be offered to the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund more safe
                                    and advantageous than that proposed by the bill, wherein the
                                    loan is predicated on the earliest surplus revenue of the State,
                                    which has been shown, by a report already made, as ample for its
                                    liquidation before April, 1861. The only alternative of the
                                    measure proposed seems to be the issue of coupon bonds, payable
                                    not earlier than July 1, 1861. The issue of such bonds to an
                                    amount sufficient to meet the wants of the State for 1859 and
                                    1860 would be attended with cost and danger — cost, in the
                                    manufacture of the bonds and coupons and in the commissions or
                                    salaries of the Agents employed in their negotiation — danger,
                                    in the greater or less transformation of the money proceeds of
                                    these bonds into Bankers' certificates, bills of exchange or
                                    other "unavailable cash." Were such bonds now issued it is quite
                                    probable that the negotiating Agents would deem it advisable to
                                    throw the whole at once on a plethoric money market, and accept
                                    an offer at par for 6 per cents. For, although loans on call
                                    might be effected at 3 1/2 or 4 per cent , a twelve months'
                                    loan, on the best security, could not be had under 6 per cent.
                                    In such case, the larger portion of these proceeds would remain
                                    idle in the Treasury, while interest would be accruing on the
                                    bonds. Besides, an issue of a new series of State Bonds while
                                    the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund are constantly in the
                                    market for the bonds and certificates of the State, would seem
                                    to be anomalous and absurd in the extreme
                                The reeorganization of the Sinking Fund is, under any
                                    circumstances, a matter of present necessity. The commissions of
                                    the managers of that Fund expire on the first of next month. In
                                    providing for future elections the Committee have had in view
                                    the magnitude of the interests involved and the advantages of a
                                    permanent line of policy and action in reference to those
                                    interests. Under the present system a total change might occur
                                    at every election. The Committee now propose that half of the
                                    Board shall have the experience and knowledge acquired by at
                                    least two years of service.
                                The expediency of commencing the term of service and official
                                    year subsequent to the adjournment of the electing Legislature
                                    is apparent. The advantages of the arrangement contemplated by
                                    the bill are, in brief:
                                The use of the monies required, and when required, at a fair rate
                                    of interest, and the opportunity of repayment at any moment and
                                    in any sum; the saving of exchange and of at least ten thousand
                                    dollars a year on the interest account; the use of an
                                    organization which has been tried and whose past operations have
                                    evidenced the most careful and efficient management; the taking
                                    away from one department all danger of loss; the diminution of
                                    risk in another department, and the throwing around both
                                    additional securities in bonds and penalties. In view of the
                                    foregoing reasons, and of others equally obvious, the
                                        Committee of Ways and Means unanimously
                                    recommend the passage of the bill.
                                Mr. COLGROVE moved to lay the bill and report on the table, and
                                    200 copies of both be printed for the use of the House.
                                Mr. RITTER moved 1,000 copies of the report and 200 copies of the
                                    bill.
                                Mr. COLGROVE accepted, and it was so ordered.
                                Mr. HUNTER introduced a bill (No. 73) to raise a revenue for State purposes for the
                                    years 1858 and 1860.
                                Mr. COTTON introduced a bill (No. 74) to provide for and secure
                                    the right of married women to real estate. Which bills were
                                    passed ihe first reading.
                                Mr. Colgrove's bill (H. R. 5,) to amend the divorce law of 1852,
                                    coming up in order, it was passed the third and last reading in
                                    the House of Representatives, by yeas 90, nays 4.
                            
                            
                                ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                                The bill (S. 28,) to
                                    provide for the time, place and manner of electing Senators of
                                    the United States, and providing for the punishment of officers
                                    failing to certify such elections, coming up in order on the
                                    second reading, it was read through by the Clerk.
                                On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, its consideration was made the special
                                    order for Tuesday next at two o'clock, P. M.
                                The bill (S. 11) to
                                    provide for the ventillation of county prisous, was passed the
                                    second reading.
                                The bill (S. 15)
                                    authorizing County Commissioners to take possession of abandoned
                                    turnpikes, 'c , coming up — 
                                On motion by Mr TURPIE, it was amended by striking out the
                                    emergency clause.
                                Mr. COMSTOCK proposed to amend by adding appropriately:
                                "Provided, That nothing in this act shall be so
                                    construed as to affect any plank road, 'c., leased or sold by
                                    any person or corporation which has not been abandoned by such
                                    person or corporation."
                                The amendment was adopted; and then,
                                On motion by Mr. HARNEY, the bill as amended was referred to the
                                        Committee on Roads.
                                The bill (S. 16) for the relief of James O'Brien, coming up on
                                    the second reading —
                                On motion by Mr. MILLER, it was referred to a select committee of
                                    five, which the Speaker makes to consist of Messrs. Miller,
                                    Blythe, Hunter, Baird and Edwards.
                            
                            
                                ADJOURNING TILL MONDAY.
                                Mr. DAVIS moved to reconsider the vote  adopting the resolution of the
                                    House of Representatives, to adjourn over from Saturday 11
                                    o'clock A. M., till Monday 2 o'clock P. M.
                                But the House refused to reconsider - yeas 44 nays 49.
                                The House then adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            SATURDAY, December 11, 1858.
                        
                        The Senate did not sit to-day.
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            SATURDAY, December 11, 1858.
                        
                        The reading of the Journal was dispensed with.
                        Mr STANFIELD asked for the reading ofthe journal of Mr. Smith, of Perry's
                            report of the Committee on Ways and Means' bill, (H.
                            R. 70,) and the order taken thereon.The Journal, which copies the
                            committee's report first, and then the bill, was read as follows:
                         "After the reading of which a first time - 
                        "Mr. COLGROVE moved that the report and pending bill be laid on the
                            table, and that there be printed for the use of the House, one thousand
                            copies of the report, and two hundred copies of the bill
                        "Which was agreed to."
                        Mr. S. moved to correct the Journal. The Chair and the House knew that
                            the bill was reported by the gentleman trom Perry, before he read the
                            report, there was then, as he contended, the first reading of the bill,
                            and the House, according to parliamentary usage, had nothing whatever to
                            do with the committee's report. The report goes on the Journal, and
                            requires no action of the House, and it was contrary to parliamentary
                            rule for the Chair to present a question upon concurrence in the simple
                            argumentative part of the report of the committee. It was just like any
                            other matter of argument submitted by a member. He desired to make the
                            record conform to the fact, which it was certainly in the power of the
                            House to do.The SPEAKER Undoubtedly. But the Chair has this to say; that
                            at the time of the introduction of the bill there was no order taken. A
                            motion had been made by the gentleman from Jefferson, (Mr. Branham,) and
                            sustained by the House, to suspend the order of business, and then the
                            bill was read preceding the argument of the committee in support, of it.
                            But altogether, it was but one report. The bill was a part of the
                            report, and read s such. I regard both the bill and the argument as
                            constituting the report. This is the decision of which the gentleman
                            from St. Joseph complains. But it is right in principle, and according
                            to precedent. In all my experience and observation, there is not an
                            instance of a committee report going by without the question of
                            concurrence.
                        Mr. STANFIELD. When a bill is reported, is it not in the possession of
                            the House? I do not wish a reversal of the decision oi the Chair, but
                            only that the Journal should show the facts.
                        The SPEAKER. There was no question raised as to the decision of the
                            Chair. There is no such thing as putting a decision of the Chair on the
                            Journal, without a question on an appeal; and then the decision upon the
                            appeal becomes matter of special record, to be entered at the close of
                            the Journal for the day.
                        Mr. EDWARDS could not see anything in this review of the Speaker's
                            decision yesterday. The time for an appeal was past; and it should be
                            submitted in writing.
                        The SPEAKER. All the proceeding is shown upon the record. There may be
                            error in laying the bill on the table, if it is regarded as a bill; but
                            the Chair regarded it as simply a part of the report.
                        Mr. DAVIS. There was nothing in this more than the desire to be right on
                            the record. It was unimportant. But he submitted, (as he had once
                            before,) that when a committee makes a report there is no question upon
                            concurrence. When a commiftee returns a proposition with amendments, the
                            question arises: Will the House concur? The argument of the committee
                            amounts to nothing but argument. The House has to vote only on the
                            amendments offered. In his little experience and observation, he had
                            never until this session heard the question put on concurrence in the
                            matter of a report. If the committee report a resolution the question
                            will come upon its adoption; or it the committee recommend the passage
                            of a bill, the question comes up on the reading. As to the matter
                            submitted by the gentleman from St. Joseph, there could be no difference
                            of opinion as to the question of fact. We have no right to lay on the
                            table, or make an order to print a bill not in the possession of the
                            House.
                        Mr. EDWARDS admitted that the mere argument of a report presented no
                            question There was no doubt on that point But nothing could be gained by
                            raising this question about the record. If we were to make a rule to
                            suit the action of yesterday, it would amount to nothing.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair has been misled by the Journal of the last
                            session, if there is a misleading, and if gentlemen think so, the Chair
                            would suggest that the only way of getting at it would be to reconsider
                            the vote of yesterday, laying the matter on the table, in order that
                            there may be a second reading of the bill.
                        Mr. EDWARDS. That would be the proper course to pursue. No doubt there is
                            precedent for the action of yesterday, but it is certainly
                            irregular.
                        Mr. STANFTELD. All I have desired is that the record should show the
                            facts. I would submit the following, which I have written here:
                        
                            
                                
                                    "Resolved, That the following entry be made
                                        by way of correction of the Journal of yesterday, after the
                                        reading of the bill from the Committee on Ways and
                                            Means:
                                    "Thereupon the Chair decided it was not the first reading of
                                        the bill, and that the House could not be in possession of
                                        the bill, until the report was concurred in."
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr EDWARDS. Would it not be satisfactory to the gentleman to
                            reconsider?
                        Mr. STANFIELD acquiesced.
                        On motion of Mr. EDWARDS the vote of yesterday, on tabling and printing
                            the bill and report,was reconsidered, the bill was read through the
                            second time and laid on the table, and it was ordered that 200 copies of
                            the bill and 1,000 copies of the report be printed for the use of the
                            House of Representatives.
                        
                        
                            PETITIONS.
                            Mr. USREY presented the petition of sundry citizens of Sullivan
                                county, asking for the passinge of Mr. U.'s bill (H. R. 21) fixing
                                the time of holding the Circuit Court in Sullivan county, which was
                                referred to the Committee on the Organization of
                                    Courts.
                            Mr. U. also presented the petition of other citizens of Sullivan
                                county, asking for the authorization of a conventional rate of
                                interest, not to exceed 10 per cent., which was referred to the
                                    Committee on Rights and Privileges.
                        
                        
                            COMMON PLEAS JURORS.
                            Mr. TURPIE, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned Mr. Prosser's bill (H. R 35) to amend the act providing the
                                method of empaneling petit jurors for the Court of Common Pleas,
                                recommending indefinite postponement. The committee say: The object
                                of the bill is to empower the Sheriff to select the jury from among
                                the bystanders, instead of having the selection made by the county
                                officers; and in their argument they allege, that the administration
                                of such a law as the bill proposes, would increase the number of
                                "professional jurors."
                            On motion by Mr. DOUGHERTY, the bill was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            THERE IS A PUBLIC PRINTER.
                            Mr. MELLETT, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                to whom was referred the resolution of the House of Representatives,
                                enquiring whether there is such an officer as Public Printer,
                                reported the result of their deliberations in writing, being
                                certainly informed that Joseph J. Bingham is Public Printer to the
                                State of Indiana, and that he holds and uses the said office of
                                Public Printer by the commission of the Governor, and will hold and
                                use it till his successor shall be elected and qualified.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            CONSTABLES OFFICIAL BONDS
                            Mr. SCOTT, from the Judiciary Committee, to whom
                                was referred the resolution of inquiry as to such a change of the
                                law as would authorize the the approval of constables' official
                                bonds by the Board of township trustees, reported back the
                                resolution, with the expression of opinion that such a change would
                                be inexpedient.
                            The resolution was laid on the table.
                            Mr. BROTHERTON, from the Committee on Rights and
                                    Privileges, returned the resolution to restrict the
                                sale of patent medicines, and the petition on that subject, with the
                                expression of opinion that Legislation is inexpedient thereon.

                                of Circuit Courts, and prescribing their duties, which was passed
                                the first reading.
                        
                        
                            HOUSES OF REFUGE.
                            Mr. HILL submitted a resolution to the effect, that the

                                into the expediency of erecting houses of refuge for juvenile
                                offenders, which was adopted.
                        
                        
                            RESOLUTIONS.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON submitted a resolution that the Senate will, the House
                                concurring, adjourn on Wednesday, the 22nd inst., which was adopted
                                by the casting vote of the President.
                            Mr. LINE submitted a resolution of inquiry into the expediency of
                                legislation for the protection of sheep and raising of the same.
                            Mr. HENDRY submitted a resolution of inquiry into the expediency of
                                abolishing the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON submitted a resolution that the Committee on
                                    Agriculture inquire if there can be any encouragement
                                given to the people for the raising of sheep, and report by bill or
                                otherwise, which was adopted.
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved, ineffectually, to suspend the order of business
                                and take up messages from the House of Representatives.
                            
                            Mr. SLACK introduced a bill (No. 90) to amend an act providing for
                                holding Courts in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit.
                            The bill was passed the first reading.
                        
                        
                            ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            Mr. WALLACE presented a bill (No. 91) regulating the mode of choosing
                                United States Senators, prescribing the time, place, &c.
                            Mr. WALLACE. With the consent of the Senate, I desire to say, at this
                                time, that it was my intention to have introduced the bill just read
                                as a substitute for the one passed some days ago by the Senate.
                                Unfortunately, on account of indisposition, I was absent during the
                                consideration of the act passed. I avail myself of the opportunity,
                                the first I have had, to offer this measure.
                            I have given it a careful consideration, and say now that, in
                                devising and drafting it, I endeavored to rise above all partizan
                                considerations, having in view the benefit of the whole people, and
                                not the advantage of the Democratic or Republican, Abolition or
                                American party.
                            The bill proposes a mode of choosing United States Senators by the
                                General Assembly, in conformity to the Constitution of the United
                                States. Its leading feature is a novel one, viz: providing a plan by
                                which the voters at large can designate whom they want the
                                Legislature to choose United States Senator.

                            In drafting it, Sir, I had in view several great reforms, among which
                                I may, at this time, mention - first, making the election of United
                                States Senators a certainty whenever those
                                elections became necessary. By examining the bill, it will be seen
                                that, whether the majority of the people designate a Republican or a
                                Democrat, it will be the duty of every member of the General
                                Assembly, regardless of his politics, to go into a joint convention
                                on the second Tuesday of the session, at which time the election is
                                required to take place, and vote for the person receiving the
                                popular designation. Thus, Sir, if I should be a member of the
                                Legislature required to elect, and the people should designate a
                                Republican as their choice for United States Senator, under th s
                                bill it would be my duty to vote for such Republican. On the other
                                hand, if the person designated by the people should be a Democrat,
                                every Republican Senator and Representative would be in duty bound
                                to vote for him. In this way I hope to place the election of United
                                States Senators above the contingencies of politics.
                            Secondly, I desired to give the people, through the ballot-box, a
                                voice in the selection of those officers, the most honorable
                                incident to their sovereignty as a State. For this purpose, the bill
                                says that the people shall designate the person, leaving the
                                Legislature merely to fill to constitu tional requirement, and
                                formally choose 'he person thus designated to be such Senator.
                            Thirdly. A great point in this intended reform was to bring gentlemen
                                filling the places of United States Senators down to the people. Of
                                late years, Sir, there has been too much hiding behind veils, too
                                much shrouding themselves in cloud and mystery, too much standing
                                afar off in grand elevation, on the part of our delegates to the
                                National Senate. I would bring themnow and in the future out of
                                that. I would compel them to feel a lively interest in the mass of
                                their constituency. I would compel them to feel a lively interest in
                                the masses of their constituency. I would compel them to consult the
                                will of those to whom power to make unmake them is directly given. I
                                would see United States Senators look to the commonality more than
                                to Legislatures. I would, at the proper time, drive them to the
                                stump to solicit suffrages, and thus enable the humblest voters to
                                see how they look, and learn who they are, and what principles they
                                follow, and measure their ability to advocate them in the national
                                councils. All this has bee recently tried in Illinois.
                            I again say, Sir, that I have no partizan motive in the measure. It
                                is my judgment that, if the bill becomes the law, the system it
                                proposes will remain forever. Let it be tried; let the popular
                                privilege it confers be once enjoyed; let the people once taste the
                                great liberty it gives them to designate whom they want to fill the
                                high and responsible places of United States Senators, and no hand
                                will ever be raised to strike it down. At the proper time, Sir, I
                                may say more on this subject.
                            The bill was passed the first reading.
                            Mr. CRAVENS introduced a bill (No. 92) to change the time for the
                                election of members of Congress, and to amend the act now in force

                            On motion by Mr. TARKINGTON, the rules were suspended for the purpose

                            The amendment which proposed that the county appraiser appoint his
                                deputies was not concurred in; also, the amendment for providing
                                plats for appraisers of all cities, towns and villages was not
                                agreed to; also, the repeal of several sections of the present law
                                for the taxation of railroad and other incorporated companies was
                                not agreed to. All the other amendments were concurred in.
                            The following bills from the House of Representatives, were severally

                                -

                                remarks.
                            Mr. WAGNER. Hoped the Senate would not take hasty action in the
                                matter. It was said that these parties (securities) were not
                                notified of the protest, and if so it was a question whether they
                                were legally liable. This point shonld be investigated, and he moved
                                its reference to the Judiciary Committee with
                                power to send for persons and papers.
                            The motion was agreed to
                            And then the Senate adjourned.

                                    Committee on Roads.
                            Mr. USREY presented the petition of sundry citizens of Sullivan
                                county, asking for a conventional interest - not to exceed 10 per
                                cent., which was read and referred to the Committee on

                            QUALIFICATION OF ELECTORS.
                            Mr. PARKS, from the Committee on the Rights and Privileges
                                    of the Inhabitants of the State, to whom was referred
                                Mr. Gregory's bill (H. R. 27) to amend the Constitution so as to
                                confine the qualifications of an elector, &c., returned the
                                same, with the expression of opinion that legislation on the subject
                                is inexpedient.
                            Mr. GREGORY moved to refer the bill to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary
                            Mr. COLGROVE. That committee had already reported against legislation
                                on this matter.
                            The motion was rejected.
                            On motion by Mr. GREGORY, it was then referred to a select committee
                                of five, which the Speaker made to consist of Messrs Gregory,
                                Blythe, Branham, Hamilton of Boone, and Mellett.

                            Mr. DAVIS, from the Committee of the Judiciary,
                                reported back his bill (H. R. 36) to amend the first section of the
                                act to extend the terms of Circuit Courts by adjournment,
                                recommending an additional section to this effect:
                            "SECTION 3. Whenever the Judge shall fix the time for homing such
                                special term, the clerk, if the Judge require it, shall issue a
                                summons to the grand and pet it jurors of the last term to attend at
                                the special term, &c."
                            The report was concurred in, the amendment adopted, and the bill, as
                                amended, was ordered to be engrossed.
                        
                        
                            HOUSES OF REFUGE
                            Mr. DOBBINS submitted the following, which was adopted: 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS, Section second of article 9th of the
                                            Constitution of the State, declares that "the General
                                            Assembly shall provide Houses of
                                            Refuge, for the correction and reformation of juvenile
                                            offenders; and WHEREAS, recent developments admonish us
                                            of the increase of this character of offenders; and
                                            WHEREAS, it is unwise and impolitic to send such
                                            youthful outlaws to the State Prison to mingle with the
                                            old, experienced, and hardened creatures of crime, such
                                            as are usually sent to that institution; Therefore be
                                            it
                                        Resolved, That the Speaker is hereby
                                            authorized to appoint a select committee, consisting of
                                            one member from each Congressional District in the
                                            State, whose duty it shall be, at as early day as
                                            possible, to report a bill to this House, which, in the
                                            language of the Constitution, "shall provide Houses of
                                            Refuge for the correction and reformation of juvenile
                                            offenders:" Provided, That there shall
                                            not be more than five nor less than three of such houses
                                            erected and that the same shall be located in various
                                            parts of the State.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            PAPER CURRENCY.
                            On motion by Mr. STANFIELD, Mr. Martin's bill (H. R. 9) to prevent
                                the circulation of unauthorized paper currency, was taken up, with
                                the report thereon, and referred to a select committee of five,
                                which the Speaker makes to consist of Messrs. Stanfield, Mellett,
                                Colgrove, Dobbins and Merrifield.

                                consent:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the use of this Hall be
                                            granted to the State Teachers' Association for holding

                                and prescribing punishment therefor, approved June 14, 1852, which
                                was passed the first reading.
                        
                        
                            LIQUOR TRAFFIC.

                            Which bills were passed the first reading.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY SEAT OF PERRY.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry, introduced a bill (No. 79) supplemental to the
                                act providing for the relocation of county seats, relocation of
                                highways, &c., approved March 2, 1855, and providing for a
                                relocation of county seat, where lands and Courthouses have been
                                donated and petition filed, which was read through and passed the
                                first reading.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. I move to suspend the rule, and that the bill be read
                                the second time now.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry. This is a bill for a specific purpose. Although
                                in the form of a general law, it will only affect the people of
                                Perry county. My constituents are exceedingly anxious, for several
                                reasons, that it should be immediately passed. One cause for this
                                emergency is that, within a few months, large numbers of emigrants
                                from abroad have removed to my county - the county of Perry - and
                                they are rapidly building up a town which they have called by the
                                name of Tell City. The gentlemen interested in this town have come
                                from twenty-three societies in other countries; they have improved
                                and opened streets, received conveyances of their lots; and within
                                the next month there will be a call for the examination and record
                                of perhaps thirteen or fourteen hundred deeds. The present county
                                seat is some twenty miles from the center, and in addition to the
                                inconvenience which would arise from the necessity for the
                                examination and record of these deeds at the present county seat, it
                                is the almost unanimous desire of the people of the county, that
                                this change should be made - the removal of the county seat to
                                Canelton, where the ground is donated and the Court house built.
                                More than two thirds of the voters in the county have petitioned for
                                it; but it can not be made under the existing law. For these and
                                other reasons it is desirable that this bill should pass with all
                                reasonable speed.
                            The rules were suspended - Yeas 71, Nays 1, and the bill was read the
                                second time by its title.
                            On motion by Mr. SMITH, of Perry, it was referred to a special
                                committee of five, which, the Speaker makes to consist of Messrs.
                                Smith, of Perry, Stanfield, Blythe, Davis and Mellett.
                        
                        
                            LIQUOR.
                            Mr. NELSON introduced a bill, (No. 80,) to regulate the sale of
                                spirituous or intoxicating liquors, prescribing penalties for the
                                violation of the same, and to raise revenue from the sale of such
                                liquors.
                        
                        
                            FREE BANKS.
                            Mr. MURRAY introduced a bill, (No. 81,) requiring the Auditor of
                                State to pay over moneys or stocks belonging to the proprietors or
                                stock holders of banks.
                        
                        
                            ASSESSORS.
                            Mr. WATERMAN introduced a bill (No. 82) to provide for the election
                                of County Assessors and prescribing their dutiesto provide for the
                                appointment of Deputy Assessors, and prescribing their duties, and
                                to repeal all laws in confiict with this act[abolishing Township

                            THE BLIND SCHOOL.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from J. McWorkman,
                                Superintendent of the Institution for the Education of the Blind
                                responding to the resolution of Mr. Smith, of Perry, calling for
                                information touching the relative cost, per
                                capita, of supporting similar institutions in the United
                                States, and staring that he was in possession of no certain
                                information, but that he had opened a correspondence with several
                                Superintendents, the result of which he would communicate at the
                                earliest moment.

                                sold.]
                            Mr. CRAVENS moved its reference to the Committee on
                                    Education, and it was so referred.

                                time.
                            Messrs. WAGNER, WEIR and TURNER hoped it would be passed as soon as
                                possible.
                            Mr. CONNER thought it should be referred to a committee.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved its reference to the Judiciary
                                    Committee.
                            Mr. WEIR moved to amend the motion by referring it to a select
                                committee.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the bill was referred to the

                            COLLECTION OF JUDGMENTS.
                            The bill (H R. 39) to regulate

                                against public officers or administrators, or corporations receiving
                                and holding money in a juduciary capacity, or the sureties of either
                                or any of them, was read through the second time.

                                1847.
                            Mr. HEFFREN offered an amendment "making all sums of money to be paid
                                said Nathan Rowley, to be paid out of the treasury of Vanderburg
                                county."
                            Mr. GREEN moved its reference to the Judiciary
                                    Committee.
                            Mr. WAGNER moved to amend the motion by referring it to the
                                    Committee on Claims.
                            The amendment were agreed to, and the bill and pending amendment were

                            JURISDICTION OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.
                            Mr. Rice's bill (S. 27) a bill regulating the jurisdiction of
                                Justices of the Peace in case of attachment, was read through the
                                third time
                            The question being shall the bill pass? a constitutional provision
                                demanding the yeas and nays, they were ordered, and being taken,
                                resulted - yeas 44, nays 0.
                            So the bill passed.
                            The title of the bill was then read and adopted.
                        
                        
                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
                            Mr. WAGNER asked and obtained leave of absence for the Senator from
                                Rush [Mr. Cooper] who is kept from his seat by ill health.
                        
                        
                            WARMING THE SENATE CHAMBER.
                            Mr. WALLACE obtained unanimous consent to submit the following
                                report:
                            Mr. PRESIDENT - The Committe to whom was referred the resolution
                                adopted yesterday in reference to overhauling the heating
                                arrangements of the Senate Chamber, and report whether the same can
                                he improved: beg leave to report that the only immediate available
                                improvement they can now suggest will be to order the coal stoves
                                now in use to be removed and exchanged for suitable stoves
                                constructed for burning wood. They submit this suggestion with the
                                hope that it will be at once adopted.
                            The committee further report that they will, at the earliest moment,
                                consult some person skillful in the science, with a view to the
                                perfection of some plan for heating the chamber from the basement of
                                the house, so that Senators will not be so troubled during the
                                continuance of the ensuing session. In the meantime, they renew
                                their suggestion of an exchange of stoves as above stated, and
                                recommend that the Door-keeper be charged with that duty
                                immediately.
                            The report was concurred in by consent.
                        
                        
                            EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION.
                            Mr. Rice's bill (S. 71) to amend section 6 of an act providing for
                                the assessment of real and personal property, for the election of
                                assessors, &c., approved June 21, 1852, was read through the
                                third time.
                            Mr. RICE explained that this bill was for the purpose of exempting a
                                class of property that has never been exempted heretofore, viz:
                                private female seminaries that are now subject to taxation. The bill
                                was drawn up under the 8th article of the Constitution, which
                                provides for the encouragement of seminaries of learning.
                            Mr. CONNER moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was ordered
                                to be engrossed.
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved to lay it on the table.
                            The motion was rejected.
                            Mr. CONNER withdrew his motion to reconsider.
                            
                            Mr. WALLACE moved to recommit the bill the Judiciary
                                    Committee.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.
                            Mr. WEIR moved a reconsideration of the vote by which the resolution
                                providing for an adjourment on Wednesday next, was adopted, for the
                                purpose of rejecting the proposition.
                            Mr. MARCH moved a call of the House.
                            A motion was made to adjourn, but withdrew for - 
                            Mr. MARCH, who asked and obtained leave to present a memorial from
                                the Society of Friends of this State, and the eastern part of the
                                State of Illinois, upon the subject of Temperance. He moved that it
                                be read and referred to the Committee on
                                    Temperance.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            And then the Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The PRESIDENT directed the Secretary to proceed with the call of the
                                Senate.
                            Mr.TURNER moved that further proceedings in the cal be dispensed
                                with.
                            The motion was rejected.

                            
                                BUSINESS OF THE REGULAR SESSION.
                                Mr MURRAY moved that the call be dispensed with in order to
                                    enable him to introduce a joint resolution. The motion was
                                    agreed to.
                                Mr. MURRAY introduced a joint resolution (No. 5) for continuing
                                    in power the organization of the two Houses of the General
                                    Assembly at the commencement of the regular session, and
                                    providing for the continuation of business from the point where
                                    it is left at the close of this session, which was read through
                                    the first time, and passed to the second reading.
                            
                            
                                ABOLISHMENT OF COMMON PLEAS.
                                The PRESIDENT announced the order of the day, being Mr. Murray's
                                    resolution proposing to abolish the Courts of Common Pleas, as
                                    follows:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the
                                                  committee on the Judiciary be
                                                instructed to report a bill providing for the
                                                abolition of the Court of Common Pleas, transferring
                                                the business thereof to the Circuit Court,
                                                increasing the circuits to not less than thirty, and
                                                providing for the holding of three terms per
                                                year.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. MURRAY explained the importance of his resolution and urged a
                                    vote upon it as a test of the sense of the Senate upon this
                                    subject.
                                Mr. STEELE thought the adoption of this resolution was not the
                                    policy for this session. His constituents were not in favor of
                                    it. He was astonished when, the other day, the Senator from
                                    Greene (Mr. Conley) withdrew a resolution inquiring into the
                                    expediency of inaugurating a Surrogate system like that in force
                                    in New York. He was not prepared to act today upon this matter.
                                    The resolution makes it imperative to report a bill abolishing
                                    this system. His constituents were dissatisfied with the Common
                                    Pleas system, but they would like to see what is to be put in
                                    the place of it before it is abolished.
                                Mr. WEIR understood the resolution was for the purpose of getting
                                    an expression of views upon the subject. He would like to have
                                    it sofixed that in vacation they could settle issues. One third
                                    of the time of the Court is now used by lawyers in making up
                                    issues in Court time. This simple amendment would save at least
                                    seventy five thousand dollars a year to parties to law suits in
                                    this State. If we do abolish the Common Pleas system, we muse
                                    put the probate business into hands that have no other business
                                    to attend to. Before voting for the resolution he wanted some
                                    other changes made. It is more important to change the law with
                                    regard to the making up of issues than to abolish the Court of
                                    Common Pleas. He would settle them as they do in New York -
                                    instead of summons being issued by the Court, the Attorney
                                    serves himself, and if the party demurs, it is settled by the
                                    Judge in Chambers. The districts are composed of several
                                    counties, and there is more than one Judge for each district.
                                    They have eight districts in New York and four Judges in each
                                    district. A smaller number of Judges would answer for this State
                                    - twenty-two or twenty-four would do,
                                Mr. HEFFREN offered the following amendment to the
                                    resolution:
                                "Strike out 'thirty,' and insert 'twenty.'
                                "This only increases the circuits some seven or eight. He was in
                                    favor of blotting out this Common Pleas Court and increasing the
                                    salary of Circuit Judges.
                                Mr. BENNETT was in favor of some change of the Judicial system,
                                    but was not prepared for the passage of such a peremptory
                                    resolution. He woull offer the following as an amendment:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the
                                                  Committee on the Organization of
                                                  Courts be instructed to report a bill
                                                for the re-organization of our Judicial system, so
                                                as to render the same more economical and
                                                effective.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. TARKINGTON said his constituents were tired of the Common
                                    Pleas system. He had not seen a bill submitted that would mend
                                    the township system of doing business in the State, and he was
                                    in favor of re organizing that, also.
                                Mr. McLEAN said two years ago he was in favor of abolishing the
                                    Common Pleas system, and he has been strengthened in his opinion
                                    ever since. If you desire to diminish litigation in the State,
                                    the abolition of this court would tend more than anything else
                                    to accomplish that end. $3,600 is paid to Common Pleas Judges in
                                    his district, while only $1,000 is paid to the Circuit
                                    Judge.
                            
                            
                                MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE.
                                A message was received from the House of Representatives by R. J.
                                    Ryan, its Principal Clerk, informing the Senate that the House
                                    had passed a resolution requesting the Senate to return the bill
                                        (S. 31) providing for
                                    holding Courts in Bartholomew county.
                                Also, that the House had passed a resolution that this General
                                    Assembly adjourn sine die on Wednesday, 22d inst.
                                Also, that the House had passed the bill (H. R 36) to amend
                                    section 1 of an act to provide for the extension of the terms of
                                    the Circuit Courts, and to authorize the Judges to hold special
                                    terms, approved February 12, 1855.
                                Also, that the House had passed the bill (H.  R. 73) to raise a
                                    revenue for State purposes for the years 1859 and 1860.
                                In all of these several cases, the concurrence of the Senate is
                                    respectfully requested.
                            
                            
                                ABOLISHMENT OF COMMON PLEAS.
                                Mr. WALLACE was surprised that so many Senators were opsosed to
                                    the Common Pleas system. He was opposed to this continual
                                    changing. He thought these propositions were another leap in the
                                    dark. The greatest objection to this Court seems to be the
                                    expense. He ventured to say there were not six districts in the
                                    State where two-thirds of the salary of the Judge was not,
                                    derived from fees. Not one salary comes in full from the county
                                    treasury, he would venture to say. In his district, (Montgomery
                                    and Boone,) the fees pay entirely the salary of the judge. If
                                    the principal amount of salary arises from fees in that Court,
                                    the county nor State does not pay it - nobody but the losing
                                    party pays it.
                                He undertook to say if you strike down this Court there will be
                                    inevitably a suspense of justice. For two terms past, there has
                                    been no litigation of a civil character of any importance in his
                                    district, in the Circuit Court, because there were so many
                                    criminal cases on the docket. Thus you see the entire judicial
                                    business of the county could never be discharged by one single
                                    court. If it is true that the fees pay the salary car, there be
                                    a more economical system proposed? and if the time of Circuit
                                    Judges is now nearly all fakeri up with criminal cases, how can
                                    they find time to transact the Common Pleas business?
                                Mr. STEVENS said his constituents were well enough pleased with
                                    the Common Pleas system. The people generally are satisfied with
                                    it. He was opposed to radical changes; when a system acts well
                                    and the people are satisfied with it, he was in favor of letting
                                    it alone. The people don't feel free to approach a Circuit
                                    Judge; but they can talk with Common Pleas Judges more freely,
                                    because they associate with them every day,and they do not
                                    approach the Common Pleas Judge with as much awe as they do the
                                    Circuit Judge. He was not prepared to make a speech upon the
                                    subject, but he was opposed to changes; the people would have to
                                    be continuallly upon the wing to keep up, if the Legislature of
                                    the State begin to make them.
                                He thought the people were not prepared for the change.
                                Mr. CONNER could not allow a vote without expressing an opinion.
                                    So far as he has heard an expression of opinion, no course has
                                    been of more satisfaction to the people than the Common Pleas
                                    system. No two Senators that had addressed the Senate have
                                    agreed upon any new system proposed. He would vote against the
                                    resolution and against the amendments.
                                Mr. HENDRY was in favor of a change, but could not designate what
                                    that should be. A change might be effected for the better.
                                Mr. RICE was satisfied with the Common Pleas system, and he
                                    believed the people on the Wabash were. If any plan were matured
                                    which would be better than the Common Pleas, he might consider
                                    it, however. The great object would be to prune the judicial
                                    system, and amend it if we can to advantage. He was in favor of
                                    perfecting the system rather than abolishing it.
                                Mr. STEELE said it was premature to adopt the resolution. He
                                    would rather bear with the present system than to adopt one far
                                    worse. It is not the expense his people object to. It is that
                                    estates are eat up by this court. The Clerks' costs are great,
                                    and so are the Attorney's fees. He was not on the side of
                                    Attorneys, but upon the side of those unfortunate persons who
                                    have estates fo settle.
                                Mr BOBBS said this was a question in which his constituents had
                                    an abiding interest. Take the item of probate business alone in
                                    Marion county, and add the criminal business, and where will you
                                    find a Court that can discharge the duties of such a Court, and
                                    do it well? The objection that this Court has been expensive, he
                                    thought far-fetched. In this county it pays the expenses of the
                                    Judge. It is a self-sustaining Court, excepting the expenses of
                                    the jury. The docket fees of the Common Pleas Court for this
                                    county, show that in the last year, thirteen hundred dollars
                                    have or will be collected, while the Judge's salary is only
                                    eight, hundred dollars, and the business and incidental expenses
                                    one hundred and fifty dollars. No Circuit Court can do all the
                                    business of this district, he ventured to affirm, and until he
                                    saw something that would meet our wants, he would vote against
                                    the resolution.
                                A motion to adjourn was voted down.
                                Mr. WALLACE moved that the resolution and pending amendmendments
                                    lay upon the table, but, withdrew it at Mr. Murray's
                                    request.
                                Mr. CRAVEN did not understand that if this resolution is adopted,
                                    the Common Pleas are abolished. If we have but one Court, his
                                    preference would be for the Circuit.
                                When he concluded, on motion - 
                                The Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            TUESDAY, December 14, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read.
                        
                            REFUSING LEGAL VOTES
                            Mr. MURRAY, from Committee on Elections, returned
                                Mr. Reefer's bill (H. R. 62)
                                for the punishment of election officers refusing to receive the vote
                                of a legal voter, with an amendment ienserting after the word
                                "shall," the words "wilfully or maliciously."
                            The repor was concurred in, and so the bill was ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                        
                        
                            THE EDWARDS AND FIRESTONE CASE.
                            Mr. MURRAY, from the Committee on Elections, to
                                whom was referred the contested election case from ihe counties of
                                Huntington and Whitley, and the resolution of the House of
                                Representatives authorizing them to appoint a commissioner to take
                                testimony in this case, reported a resolution appointing Charles
                                Walker, Esq.,of this city, as such commissioner.
                            Mr. DOBBINS opposed this report of the Chairman because it was not
                                stated that it was the report of the majority. It was also in
                                violation of the resolution of the House convening the committee to
                                appoint some person in the counties of Huntington and Whitley.  He knew nothing of Mr.
                                Wallace, and spoke only to fact. He moved to amend the report, so as
                                to read the report of the majority of the committee.
                            Mr MURRAY considered that this was unnecessary, so long as the
                                minority make no report.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. Did you submit that report to the minority?
                            Mr. MURRAY. No; and he proceeded to rehearse the action of the
                                Committee in the proceeding, by which it; was agreed to send Mr.
                                Walker. The object was to get a man wholly disconnected with the
                                contest. Mr. Firestone suggested the Judge of Common Pleas.
                            Mr. FIRESTONE said he had suggested Mr. Fowler. He had indeed spoken
                                of the Judge as qualified for the position.
                            Mr. MURRAY. Mr. Edwards (the contestant) had objected to the Judge as
                                some way connected with the case. He stated the case at length.
                            Mr. DOBBINS still objected on the grounds before stated. The question
                                was, had the committee the power to make appointment outside of the
                                counties of Huntington and Whitley.
                            The SPEAKER. If the House will concur, it will validate the
                                report.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone. The gentleman from Martin was mistaken as to
                                the action of the committee. There was a motion before the committee
                                to make this report, and the gentleman voted in the negative. He
                                also had understood that this Judge of the Common Pleas was
                                incompetent to act in the case, and it was the duty of the committee
                                to reconsider this appoint merit. It was not necessary to submit the
                                report so long as the committee had authorized the chairman to make
                                it. It would be difficult, perhaps, to find a man in those counties
                                not connected in some way with this contest.
                            Mr. DOBBINS proposed to recommit the report with instructions to
                                amend the report so as to read in accordance with the facts.
                            The SPEAKER ruled the proposition out of order.
                            Mr. DOBBINS made an ineffectual motion to lay the report on the
                                table.
                            Mr. HARRISON rehearsed the reasons why the appointment of the Common
                                Pleas Judge of Huntington county was not continued. The parties
                                interested themselves were unwilling that he should act. He replied
                                to the objections of Mr. Dobbins.
                            [A Senate message now reported the action of that body on the
                                amendments of the House of Representatives to the bill (S. 3) for the appraisement of
                                real estate, &c.]
                            Mr. POWER confirmed the statement of Mr. Hamilton, of Boone. It was
                                well understood that the Chairman was to make this report this
                                morning.
                            Mr. JORDAN had not so understood it. The intention to report this
                                morning was not declared. He also rehearsed the committee's action.
                                He resisted the appointment of any person outside of those counties.
                                This Mr. Walker was the law student of the attorney of the
                                contestor, (Mr. Edwards.) Two persons ought to be appointed. We
                                asked that as a right. But it was objected to because of the
                                expense. Was the expense too much for the case involved - the seat
                                of a member of this House?
                            Mr. MURRAY stated the facts. The attorney for Dr. Edwards was Mr.
                                Daily, of Washington courity, and not Mr. Porter. His attorney not
                                appearing, Mr. Porter was sent for to answer once before the
                                committee. Dr. Edwards has no attorney but Mr. Daily.
                            Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Porter appeared before the committee several
                                times.
                            Mr COTTON. Mr. Walker's reputation placed him above suspicion of
                                acting unprofessionally.
                            Mr. FIRESTONE, in justice to himself, desired that one Democrat and
                                one Republican be placed on this commission.
                            The House, on a division, refused to concur in the report -
                                affirmative 41, negative not reported.
                        
                        
                            ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            Mr. HARNEY moved to take up the report on his bill (H. R 37)
                                providing for the election of United Slates Senators, but objection
                                being made, he withdrew the motion.
                            Mr. MELLETT, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned Mr. Griffin's bill (H. R. 6) to amend the 238th section of
                                the Law Reform Act, approved June 18, 1812, recommending that the
                                same be laid on the table.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            INSURANCE LAWS.
                            Mr. CLEMENTS, from the Judiciary Committee,
                                returned the resolution with reference to so much of the Auditor's
                                report as relates to the insufficiency of the insurance laws,
                                recommending that the same be referred to the Committee on
                                    Corporations.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            DELINQUENT TAX LIST.
                            Mr. BAIRD, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned Mr. Dobbins' bill (H. R. 57) to amend the 147th secton of
                                the assessment law of 1852 - with reference to the publicaton of the
                                delinquent tax list. The report states that the proposed change
                                amounts to nothing, unless it were to enable the auditor and editor
                                to collude for exorbitant charges, or unless it were for the benefit
                                of some editor whose charges the Court would not sustain; and they
                                recommend indefinite postponement.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            COSTS IN CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS.
                            Mr. GRIFFIN, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned Mr. Scott's bill, (H. R. 58) to provide for he payment of
                                costs in criminal cases, and repeal the 69th section of the law
                                reform act in criminal practice, approved June 17, 1852,
                                recommending indefinite postponement.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            UNAUTHORIZED PAPER CURRENCY.
                            Mr. STANFIELD, from the select, committee on that subject, returned
                                Mr Martin's bill (H. R. 9), with the pending report thereon,
                                proposing to amend, by str king out all after the enacting clause,
                                and inserting the substitute reported from the Committee on
                                    Banks, (heretofore described in this paper).
                            
                            Mr. BAIRD moved to refer the bill to the committee on the
                                    judiciary, with instructions to inquire into its
                                constitutionality, particularly the rule of evidence involved.
                            Mr. SCOTT did not think anything could be gained by the
                                reference.
                            Mr STANFIELD could see no room for a constitutional question.
                            The House refused to refer, and the bill was ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY SEAT OF PERRY.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry, from the select committee on that subject,
                                returned his bill (H. R. 79)
                                supplemental to the act providing for the relocation of county
                                seats, &c., with an amendment, substituting for section two,
                                words to the following effect:
                            "SECTIONS. For the purposes of this act, the number of votes in said
                                county, with fifteen per centum added thereto, shall be considered
                                the whole number," &c.
                            Mr. TURPIE hoped the House would not change the existing law on this
                                subject on slight grounds. He should not be surprised to learn that
                                it was liable to constitutional objections, and moved its reference
                                to the Judiciary Committee.
                            Mr. SCOTT had confidence in the special committee, and saw nothing to
                                be gained from another reference.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry, alleged that the bill could affect no other than
                                the special case in Perry county, to which it is intended to apply.
                                He had no objection that it should go to the Judiciary
                                    Committee, if it does not take too much time.
                            The motion was lost on a division - affirmative 32, negative 40.
                            Mr. TURPIE moved, ineffectually, to lay the bill and report on the
                                table.
                            Mr. SMITH now asked that, by unanimous consent, it be referred to the
                                    Judiciary Committee.
                            And it was so ordered.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY TREASURERS.
                            Mr. Colgrove, from the Judiciary Committee, to
                                whom was referred the resolution of the House of Representatives,
                                inquiring into the expediency of repealing the law requiring County
                                Treasurers to visit each township for the collection of taxes,
                                reported a bill (No. 82) to amend the 94th section of the act to
                                provide for the valuation and assessment of real and personal
                                property, and for the collection of taxes in the State of Indiana,
                                &c., approved June 21st, 1852, and the same was passed the first
                                reading.
                        
                        
                            COMMON PLEAS JURIES.
                            On motion by Mr. PROSSER, (the order of business being suspended for
                                the purpose,) his bill (H.R. 35) to amend the act empanneling petit
                                juries in the Common Pleas, was taken up and referred to a select
                                committee of three, which the SPEAKER (Mr. Edwards in the Chair)
                                makes to consist of Messrs. Prosser, Baird and Keefer.
                            Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following, which was adopted.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the door-keeper of this
                                            House have the sky-light over the Clerk's desks
                                            repaired, so as to prevent leaking.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.
                            Mr. SHULL submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That this General Assemby
                                            will adjourn sine die of Wednesday, 22d instant.
                                        Resolved, That the Clerk inform the
                                            Senate of the adoption of the foregoing resolution.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. JEFFRIES moved to lay the resolutions on the table,Which was
                                negatived, by yeas 22, nays 70, and the question recurred on its
                                adoption.
                            Messrs. Jordan and Clements demanded the yeas and nays.
                            Mr. DAVIS proposed to add the words "and request the concurrence of
                                that body,"
                            Which was taken by consent.
                            Mr. AUSTIN said he should have no objection to the resolution if we
                                were ready. It was premature now. Important measures - measures
                                absolutely necessary to be passed at this session - were not yet
                                matured. He would adjourn earlier if we were ready. We should not
                                defeat our own action, by leaving it in a cripled condition.
                            Mr. JEFFRIES. A large amount of business had been prepared, and he
                                was opposed to leaving the appraisement and revenue bills unacted
                                on. For this reason, he had moved to lay it oa the table. He sac
                                ificed as much as any gentleman in prolonging the session.
                            Mr. JORDAN demanded the previous question, and under its operation,
                                an amendment by Mr. Colgrove was prevented, and the yeas and nays on
                                the main question, demanded by Messrs. Keefer and Jordan, resulted -
                                yeas 69, nays 25, as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS - Messrs. Black, Bowman, Boyd, Carr, Cavins,

                            So the resolution was adopted.
                            Mr. HUNTER moved that the bill (H.
                                    R. 73) to raise a revenue for State purposes for 1859 and
                                1860, be no taken up, and considered in Committee of the Whole.
                            The motion was agreed to, and (Mr. Branham in the Chair) the House
                                resolved into Committee of the Whole, and the bill was read through
                                by the Clerk, proposing 20 cents tax on the hundred dollars and 50
                                cents on the poll for 1859, and 15 cents on the hundred, and 5o
                                cents the poll for 1860.
                            The first and second sections being separately adopted without
                                amendment - 
                            On motion by Mr. MURRAY, the Committee rose, and the Chairman
                                reported recommendations that the bill pass, and the Committee be
                                discharged.
                            The report was concurred in and the bill ordered to be engrossed.
                        
                        
                        
                            COUNTY WORK-HOUSES.
                            Mr. KEMPF submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved,That the Committee on
                                                County and Township business inquire into
                                            the expediency of erecting workhouses, in connection
                                            with the county jails, for the employment of convicts,
                                            as idleness is the mother of all vice; and report by
                                            bill or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            On motion by Mr STANFIELD, (the rules and order being suspended,) Mr.
                                Hunter's bill (H. R. 73) to
                                raise a revenue for State purposes for the years 1859-1860, was
                                considered again on the third and last reading. The question taken
                                by yeas and nays, under the constitutional provision, resulted yeas
                                94, nays 0.
                            So the bill passed the House of Representatives.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on Agriculture inquire into the expediency
                                            of providing by law that when the owner of any lands
                                            shall desire to drain his land, or prevent the same from
                                            overflow of water, he may be authorized to enter upon
                                            the adjoining lands of another person and construct the
                                            necessary ditches - the damages resulting therefrom
                                            being first assessed and tendered - and report by bill
                                            or otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            THE HUNTINGTON AND WHITLEY CONTEST.
                            Mr. HAMILTON of Boone submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That this House immediately
                                            appoint and authorize some suitable person residing
                                            outside of the counties of Huntington and Whitley, to
                                            proceed immediately to take evidence for this House in
                                            the contested election case between the Hon. J. E.
                                            Firestone and the Hon. C. W. Edwards.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. KEEPER proposed to appoint two persons.
                            Mr. MURRAY preferred three.
                            Mr. POWER thought we should have either one or three.
                            Mr. KEEPER accepted "three."
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone. This testimony was to be taken in conformity
                                to law, and there was no room for party feeling.
                            Mr. KEEPER, Still all men have their biases in these cases.
                            Mr. DOBBINS proposed to amend by appointing "two," and giving them
                                the power to choose a third in case of disagreement.
                            Mr. MURRAY gave notice that, at the proper time, he would move "one"
                                Commissioner, and that he shall be a Democrat.
                            Mr. JORDAN. We do not ask that.
                            Mr. PROSSER preferred one to three.
                            On motion by Mr. TURPIE, the resolution and amendments were laid on
                                the table.
                            Mr DOUGHERTY submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved. That the Senate be requested
                                            to return to this House the Senate bill (No. 31) fixing the
                                            times of holding Common Pleas Court in Bartholomew
                                            county.
                                    
                                
                            
                            A Senate message now announced the passage in that body of the bill
                                (S. 27) relating to the jurisdiction and duties of Justices of the
                                Peace in cases of attachment.
                            Mr. NEWTON submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS, many members of this House have learned with
                                            regret that mail matter which ought to have reached
                                            their constituents the same day such mail matter was
                                            taken to the Post-office, did not reach them until the
                                            day following, or still later: therefore,
                                        Resolved, That the Door keeper be
                                            instructed to inquire of the Post-master of this city at
                                            what particular hour mail matter will be in time for the
                                            different mails, and that the Door keeper instruct the
                                            Messenger to deliver at the Post-office such mail matter
                                            as may be ready, punctually at the hour designated.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            WITNESS RESTRICTION.
                            Mr. SCOTT introduced a bill (No. 83) to amend section 238 of the Law
                                Reform Act, approved June 18th, 1852, which was passed the first
                                reading.
                            Mr. TREADWAY introduced a bill (No. 84) to amend the 31st section of
                                the act providing for the election or appointment of supervisors of
                                highways, &c., approved June 18, 1852, which was passed the
                                first reading.
                        
                        
                            EXTENDING COURT TERM BY ADJOURNMENT.
                            Mr. DAVIS' bill (H. R. 36) to amend the first section of the act
                                providing for extending the terms of the Circuit Court by
                                adjournment, &c. coming up on the third reading - 
                            Mr. DAVIS stated that the object of the bill was to relieve the
                                burdensome tax of jail keeping between the terms of Court - to put
                                it in the power of the judge to call a special term for this and
                                other business.
                            The yeas and nays being taken under the constitutional provision,
                                resulted yeas 75, nays 9.
                            So the bill passed the third and last reading in the House of
                                Representatives.
                            The House then took a recess until 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. TURPIE obtained unanimous consent to make a report from the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary; returning Mr.
                                Smith, of Perry's bill (H. R.
                                    79) for the removal of the Perry County Seat - concuring
                                in and recommencing the adoption of the report of the select
                                committee thereon.
                            The report was concured in and the bill ordered to be engrossed.

                            
                                ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                                The SPEAKER [Mr. Edwards in the Chair] announced the
                                    consideration of the special order, viz: the bill (S. 28) providing for the
                                    time, place and manner of the election of United States
                                    Senators. &c., on the second reading.
                                Mr. DAVIS submitted again his modification of the 6th section, so
                                    as to leave out the fact alleged therein, and to make it declare
                                    simply that "an emergency exists for the immediate taking effect
                                    of this act, and therefore the same shall take effect and be in
                                    force from and after its passage."
                                Mr. Speaker GORDON then took the floor in a general speech of a
                                    partizan character, pleading justification of the Republican
                                    party in its opposition to the pretended election of Mr. Bright
                                    and Mr. Fitch to the Senate of the United States, &c. When
                                    he had concluded
                                Mr. BLYTHE complained that the gentleman had occupied nearly two
                                    hours time without touching the general questions in issue.
                                    There was danger in doing wrong. When wrong was done, the safest
                                    course was to admit it. That gentleman's party had done wrong.
                                    He admitted his argument; but the gentleman had said that this election was the duty
                                    - the sworn duty of the Legislature. It would not, do for the
                                    gentleman to shield himself and his party from duty to the State
                                    by holding up their party obligation. But the gentleman had even
                                    boasted in his wrong doing. It was the duty of every man to do
                                    right, and let consequences take care of themselves. This was
                                    what he proposed to do. His Republican friends were asking of
                                    him and of Democratic members to do what they believed to be
                                    wrong. There were two questions upon which he would have been
                                    glad to have heard the gentleman from Marion: One was that
                                    involved in the amendment proposed by the gentleman from Floyd,
                                    and the other was this legal question: Has not the Senate of the
                                    United States decided and concluded this question of the right
                                    of Messrs. Bright and Fitch to sit in that body for the State of
                                    Indiana? He had heard nothing to shake the opinion he had before
                                    "expressed on this latter question. There was a point beyond
                                    which inquiry could not go - no matter how erroneous, or how
                                    corrupt the decieion may be. In this case, the Senate had
                                    exhausted its power, and conferred privileges which it could not
                                    take away. Senator Bright and Senator Fitch were judt as much
                                    invested with the right of seats in the Senate of the United
                                    States, as any other member of that body. But he distinguished
                                    between the right and the power. He justified his
                                    statement,that, if he had the right and the power to do it, he
                                    would remove these men from their places. He was assured of a
                                    just retribution for wrong doing. It had even overtaken one of
                                    these men, (Mr Bright,) who was himself the first to inaugurate
                                    those proceedings to which he now owed his place in the Senate
                                    of the United States; but at this day, with all his energy and
                                    industry, on account of his subserviency to the wrong in the
                                    question of the admission of Kansas into the Union with a
                                    fraudulent Constitution, there was scarcely a man in the State
                                    of Indiana so poor as to do him reverence. He then proceeded to
                                    support the amendment of Mr. Davis, striking out the
                                    objectionable matter contained in the emergency clause. The
                                    Constitution required not the reason for the emergency, but
                                    simply the fact of the emergency to be stated, &c.
                                Mr. STILES next gained the floor, contending earnestly for the
                                    fact in the emergency clause, as embodied in Mr Austin's
                                    resolution, which had been solemnly adopted by the House. He
                                    entered a plea of justification for the action of the Republican
                                    party in the State Legislature in 1857, which he based upon the
                                    action of Democratic members of the Legislature two years before
                                    that. It had been alleged that the legality of the election of
                                    Bright and Fitch was decided by the highest authority on earth.
                                    But one memorable decision of that same high tribunal had just
                                    been reversed. It was the case of Lecompton against the People.
                                    That high tribunal decided the case for the plaintiff, but it
                                    had been reversed by the peoplethe Democratic party could tell
                                    how, and he told where it had been reversed.
                                When he had concluded - 
                                The House (at ten minutes before five o'clock) adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            WEDNESDAY, December 15, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read.
                        Mr. HENDRY, from the Judiciary Committee, to whom was
                            referred the bill (H. R 39)

                                postponement.
                            Mr. MURRAY, from the same committee, submitted a minority report upon
                                the same subject, sustaining the provisions of Mr. Bobbs' bill (S.

                                present, he would move that the reports lie on the table. The motion
                                was agreed to.

                            COMMON SCHOOLS.
                            Mr WAGNER, from the Committee on Education, to
                                whom was referred his bill (S. 26) supplemental to an act entitled

                                    Ryan, their Clerk, informing the Senate that the House insists
                                    upon all their amendments to Mr. Tarkington's bill (S. 3) for the
                                    re-appraisement of real estate.
                                Also, that the House has passed a bill (H. R. 79) to provide for
                                    the relocation of the County Seat of Perry, &c.
                            
                            
                                FREE NEGROES.
                                Further remarks upon this matter were indulged in by several
                                    Senators, when,
                                Mr. HEFFREN withdrew his motion.
                                Mr. MARCH moved to amend the resolution by inserting in the
                                    proper place, the words "and believed to be a forgery."
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr. WEIR called for the previous question, but there was not a
                                    second.
                                Mr. MURRAY offered an amendment to his resolution, as
                                    follows:
                                "Presented by the Senator from Jefferson, without a knowledge of
                                    its contents.
                                The amendment was rejected.
                                The yeas and pays were demanded upon the adoption of the
                                    resolution, and being ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 46,
                                    nays 2.
                                So the resolution was adopted.
                            
                            
                                MILLER AND SHYROCK CONTESTED CASE.
                                The special order was now announced - being Mr. Green's
                                    resolution, declaring Mr. Shryock entitled to Mr. Miller's

                                Mr. GREEN said he had hoped some other Senator would have moved
                                    in this matter, but he had waited as long as he thought he ought

                                                entitled to the seat he new holds as Senator from
                                                the counties of Marshall, Stark, Fulton and St.
                                                Joseph, and that Kline G. Shryock, the contestant of
                                                said seat, is not legally entitled to the said
                                                seat.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. SLACK offered the following as an amendment to the
                                    amendment:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            WHEREAS, At the last session of this Senate much time
                                                was consumed and great expense incurred in
                                                contesting the seat of the Hon. Hugh Miller, a
                                                Senator upon this floor, from the counties of
                                                Fulton, Stark and St. Joseph, which consumption of
                                                time, and expenditure of money were useless and
                                                profitless, AND WHEREAS, we believe, from an
                                                examination of she evidence in said case, that said
                                                Hugh Miller did receive a majority of the legal
                                                votes cast at the election in said district for the
                                                office of Senator, at the annual election in
                                                October, 1856; AND WHEREAS, it is highly desirable
                                                that the scenes of the session of this Senate of
                                                1857, should not again be reenacted, and that the
                                                legitimate business of the Senate should not be
                                                disturbed; therefore,
                                            Be it Resolved. That Hugh Miller,
                                                Senator elect from the counties of Fulton, Stark and
                                                St. Joseph, be and he is hereby confirmed in his
                                                seat as such Senator, and that the contest of Kline
                                                G. Shryock be, and the same is hereby dismissed.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. MURRAY moved that this amendment to the amendment be laid on
                                    the table.
                                Mr. SLACK withdrew his amendment.
                                Mr. ROBINSON said that he had not had time to investigate this
                                    matter, and in compliance with the request of Mr. Miller, who
                                    was absent for the time being, he had agreed to pair off with
                                        him upon this question,
                                    and asked to be excused from voting.
                                The question being upon the adoption of Mr. McLean's amendment,

                                            that the said testimony so taken shall be all that shall
                                            be entitled before said Committee, except oral
                                            testimony, and except the House shall order
                                            otherwise.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. DOBBINS objected to the resolution. This contest was not brought
                                on by Dr. Firestone, and the House could not in justice require of
                                him such labor and expense. He would have persons disinterested to
                                take these depositions; and both these gentlemen were directly
                                interested. On the doctrine of the gentleman from Marion, (the
                                Speaker) advanced in his speech of yesterday, Mr. Firestone was now,
                                to all intents and purposes, a member of this House, and therefore
                                the expense involved in the contest for his place should not be
                                thrown on him.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone. This was a new doctrine, that would exempt Mr
                                Firestone from expense. He had proposed this plan, thinking it would
                                be satisfactory,economical to the State, and that the work could be
                                done in the vacation of the session of the General Assembly. There
                                was, (he alleged) a disposition to postpone this matter on the part
                                of the defense.
                            Mr. FIRESTONE denied the imputation of a desire to cause delay. He
                                had suggested Mr. James H. Holland as a high minded Republican, and
                                proper Commissioner to take testimony. He had confidence in Holland.
                                The Judge of Common Pleas was suggested by the Committee on
                                    Elections.
                            Mr. MURRAY. He was suggested by Mr. Harney.
                            Mr. FlRESTONE desired only that the investigation proceed fairly.
                            [A message from the Governor now announced his Excellency's approval
                                of the bill (S. 31) fixing
                                the time of Common Pleas in Bartholomew.]
                            Mr. HARNEY rehearsed the action of the committee, expressing his
                                desire thit this matter might be settled without partisan feeling or
                                influence. The resolution had been brought so suddenly before the
                                House, that he was hardly prepared to decide how he should vote upon
                                it, and would prefer that the matter be left to the committee.
                            Mr. STANFIELD saw no necessity for the resolution. He read the
                                statutory provision, that either party may take depositions in the
                                ordinary
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    THE LEGISLATIVE SENTINEL.

                        Vol. I.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, DEC. 20, 1858.
                        No. 14.
                    
                    
                        
                            way. There was neither necessity for the resolution, nor for the
                                appointment of a Commissioner. Depositions could be taken, as in
                                other cases, on notice.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone, gave the reasons which determined the
                                Committee not to take the suggestions of Mr. Firestone.
                            Mr. POWER. It was a fact known to the committee, that notice of
                                depositions was duly served, and that the contestee's attorney was
                                present at the taking, though he would not then become an attorney
                                of record. There was a "nigger in the wood-pile."
                            Mr. FIRESTONE. Had not attempted to interfere with the investigation.
                                He would have his rights - would stand up for them on all
                                occasions.
                            Mr. DOBBINS asked for a fair showing for the minority of the
                                committee. If the majority would consult the minority, this matter
                                could be settled in Committee. Democrats placed no nigger in the
                                wood-pile - the imputation came with a bad grace from the gentleman
                                from Kosciusko.
                            Mr. MURRAY was satisfied the House did not understand the resolution
                                of yesterday - refusing to concur. The matter was taken out of the
                                hands of the committee, and they were helpless; and they were now
                                merely making a suggestion for progress. It was a work of peculiar
                                modesty in Mr. Firestone to suggest commissioners, and reprimand the
                                committee for not accepting his suggestions, he would never submit
                                to such dictation. He wanted a disinterested commissioner. He
                                rehearsed the committee's proceedings
                            Mr. DAVIS suggested that Judge Stanfield be authorized to take these
                                depositions in the recess.
                            Mr. Hamilton, of Boone, accepted this modification of his
                                resolution.
                            So the resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY SEAT OF PERRY.
                            On motion by Mr. SMITH, of Perry, (the order of business being
                                suspended for the purpose,) his bill (H. R. 79) for the relocation
                                of the county seat of Perry county, (at Cannelton,) was considered
                                and passed the third and last reading in the House of
                                Representatives - yeas 91, nays 1, with an amendment of title, so as
                                to read: "An act to provide for the relocation of county seats and
                                county buildings, where two thirds of the voters of any county have
                                petitioned for relocation, designating the site and a house to be
                                used as a Court house, and where a deed has been executed; and to
                                provide for the limitations of actions growing out of such
                                relocation, and for the donation of the former county property."
                        
                        
                            BLIND SCHOOL EXHIBITION.
                            Mr. COLLIER submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Superintendent of
                                            the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, and the Superintendent
                                            of the Asylum for the Blind, are respectfully invited to
                                            give exhibitions of the proficiency of the pupils in
                                            their schools, respectively, before the members of this
                                            General Assembly.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. EDWARDS. I understand that the Superintendent of the Blind School
                                proposes to give an exhibition to-night.
                            The SPEAKER. I have such a notice.
                            Mr. EDWARDS. I move to lay the resolution on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                            The SPEAKER. The Superintendent of the Blind Asylum desires me to lay
                                before the members and officers of the House an invitation to appear
                                at the Asylum to-night at candlelight, and witness an exhibition of
                                the proficiency of his pupils.
                        
                        
                            DEBATE.
                            Mr. MURRAY submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That no member of this House
                                            shall be permitted to speak more than fifteen minutes on
                                            any question under consideration, without unanimous
                                            consent of the House.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. DOBBINS moved to lay the resolution on the table.
                            Mr. MURRAY demanded the yeas and nays, and the resolution was
                                rejected - yeas 73, nays 22.
                        
                        
                            TEMPERATURE OF THE HALL.
                            Mr. TREADWAY submitted the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a select committee of
                                            five be appointed to investigate the condition of this
                                            Hall, and ascertain whether better arrangements cannot
                                            be had for warming and ventilating the same during the
                                            coming session, and that they report as soon as
                                            practicable.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            DEBATE ON ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            Mr. BROTHERTON submitted the following :
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS, The gratifying intelligence has been received
                                            that there are a number of members of this House, who
                                            are yet desirous to deliver speeches to the same, on the
                                            bill providing for the election of United States
                                            Senators : therefore be it
                                        Resolved. That all those members who
                                            are desirous to make speeches on said bill, are hereby
                                            respectfully requested and positively required to
                                            postpone the delivery of said speeches until the next
                                            regular meeting or this General Assembly, and said
                                            speeches, when delivered, will be received by this House
                                            with like effect as if the same had been delivered
                                            before any action was taken on said bill.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. EDWARDS. The resolution, no doubt, was offered in jest, but I can
                                very properly move to lay it on the table, as I do not intend to
                                take up the time of the House on any subject.
                            Mr. BROTHERTON. In justice to Democrats around me, I have this to
                                say, that they have had no hand in getting up this resolution. I am
                                responsible for it all myself, here and elsewhere. [Laughter.]
                            Mr. HAMILTON of Boone. Debate should  close on this question. Every member
                                has his mind made up.
                            Mr. DOBBINS would claim the privilege of speaking whether the
                                resolution passed or not.
                            Mr. MURRAY. The three parties had been represented on this question,
                                each by two speeches.

                            ACTIONS ON CONTRACTS.
                            Mr. PROSSER introduced a bill (No. 86) to amend section 33 of the
                                Loan Reform Act of June 18,1852, so that all actions against makers
                                of written contracts shall be brought in the county where the maker
                                resides, except where a capias ad respondendum shall have been first
                                filed.
                        
                        
                            CANCELLATION OF BONDS.
                            Mr. BRANHAM introduced a bill (No. 87) to amend section 6 of the Act
                                in relation to applying certain funds therein named, to the payment
                                of the public debt, approved June 15,1852, so as to provide for the
                                cancellation of purchased bonds.
                            Mr. MARTIN introduced a bill (No 88) to amend section 14, of the Act
                                providing for the election of Justices of the Peace, and defining
                                their jurisdiction, powers and duties in civil cases, approved June
                                9, 1852.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Miami, introduced a bill (No. 89) to amend the third
                                section of the Act to incorporate the town of Peru, approved
                                February 14,1848.
                            Mr. COLGROVE. The bill, proposing to amend a local law, it appeared
                                to him, infrioged on the Constitution.
                            Mr. POWER introduced a bill (No. 90) to repeal the Act entitled An
                                Act to establish a Court of Cancellation, approved June 11,
                                1852.
                            Mr. STANLEY introduced a bill (No. 91) to prohibit clerks and their
                                deputies of the Supreme, Circuit and Common Pleas Courts from
                                practicing as an attorney and consellor at law declaring it a
                                misdemeanor in any clerk of the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts to
                                refuse to issue summons, and providing punishment for the same.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone, introduced a bill (No. 92) to prevent the
                                carrying of concealed and dangerous weapons, and to provide
                                punishment therefor.
                        
                        
                            APPRAISEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.
                            On motion of Mr. DAVIS, the message for the Senate, transmitting the
                                action of that body on the amendmeuts of the House of
                                Represeutatives, to the bill (S.
                                    3) for the appraisement of real estate, &c. The Senate
                                refused to concur in the following amendments of the House of
                                Representatives:
                            Striking out the proviso of the first section, and substituting
                                matter, as before reported in this paper.
                            Striking out the proviso of section five, and - 
                            Mr. Stanfield's amendment to the 24th section, repealing sections 32,
                                33, 34 and 35 of the as sessment act of June 21,1852.
                            Mr. DAVIS moved that the House insist on these amendments. If we
                                recede, the mode provided for assessing a large amount of railroad
                                property will be lost.
                            Mr. BRANHAM moved to amend the motion, and that the House recede.
                            Mr. DAVIS. All our railroad property has passed away into the hands
                                of foreigners, and whilst they come here and operate their railroads
                                he would have them taxed as other people.
                            Mr. BRANHAM was as willing as any member to have railroad property
                                taxed as any citizen or corporation is taxed. As he understood the
                                existing law it was so taxed. But if not he did not think the
                                amendment would better it.
                            Mr. STANFIELD said there was a misunderstanding between the two
                                Houses in relation to this amendment. The purpose of this law was
                                    appraise the realty of the
                                State, without reference to personal property. The Senate refused to
                                concur in the amendment repealing certain sections of the
                                appraisement law of 1852. The law of 1852 regarded and treated this
                                property (their superstructures) as personal property; and it
                                provided for its valuation with their other personal property, which
                                was apportioned among the several counties through which the road
                                runs. Now we propose to include and tax as real property all
                                permanent superstructures in the several counties along the line of
                                the road. But to perfect the system proposed, another bill will be
                                introduced and matured for the appraisement of personal property, so
                                as to give each county its just share ot tax on railroad property.
                                He had before shown, more as length, that under the present law many
                                counties were deprived of their share of tax on railroad property,
                                because of the inability of the revenue officers to acquire any
                                precise knowledge of the amount of property belonging to railroads.
                                He had seen that in several counties there was no evidence of any
                                taxation upon railroad property. By the mode pointed out in the
                                amendment, this property could not fail of coming on the list. Under
                                its provisions all the permanent railroad property is to be
                                appraised. The rolling stock and machinery will go as personal
                                property. He thought that in this way we would adopt a more perfect
                                system, and trusted the House would adhere. He had no objection to
                                the appointment of appraisers by the County Boards, &c.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone, said the law as it stands at present on this
                                subject of assessing railroad property was on pages 113, 115 of
                                Statutes. He rehearsed its provisions, and gave objections to the
                                amendment proposed. It would make the law worse.
                            Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren. The gentleman from St. Joseph seemed to have
                                overlooked the provision on page 115. The provisions of the law were
                                perfect and complete, and the amendment was not complete. It was
                                only necessary to compel the revenue officers to do their duty.
                            Mr. DAVIS. How was it that railroad property was taxed at one-tenth
                                of the original cost? Might it not be because the valuation is made
                                by their own employees. Under the operation of the amendment of the
                                gentleman from St. Joseph, we might get at it. The revenue officers
                                did not hold their places by appointment of the railroad companies
                                or of interested parties.
                            Mr. PARKS spoke in favor of insisting upon Mr. Stanfield's
                                amendment.
                            Mr. BRANHAM insisted there was no mode of getting at, the real value
                                of railroad property better than the present - through the officers
                                of the company If we proposed to tax the cost of the road, it would
                                be another thing. A large portion of railroad property was moycable
                                from county to county, and so it might escape assessment. The
                                amendment, he thought, would enable the company to reserve from
                                taxation at least one half their personal property. As he understood
                                the amendment, you assess the property where found.
                            Mr. STANFIELD said his amendment did not contemplate the personal
                                property of railroads. When we came to that, he supposed, in regard
                                to the assessment of personal property, we would adopt something
                                like the present system. It seemed to him that these
                                superstructures, &c., were reality, and should be regarded as
                                such in our assessments, and that for purposes of taxation it should
                                belong to the county where it is situated.
                            The House refused to recede, and then the House insisted on its
                                amendments.
                            Mr. EDWARDS said one of the amendments of the gentleman from St.
                                Joseph was concurred in by the Senate.
                            Mr. STANFIED. But it was necessary that those sections in the
                                appraisement act of 1852 should be repealed, or this property would
                                be taxed twice.
                            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            
                                ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                                On motion of Mr. DAVIS, the special order was dispensed with, and
                                    the House resumed the consideration of the bill (S. 28) to provide the
                                    time, place and manner of the election of United States
                                    Senators; the question being on Mr. Davis's engrossed amendment,
                                    modifying the emergency clause.
                                Mr. DOBBINS took the floor, but gave way for - 
                                Mr. TURPIE. He was heard at length in opposition, and in reply to
                                    Mr. Speaker Gordon, and Mr. Blythe.
                                Mr. DOBBINS spoke on the same part, reviewing the debate.
                                After further debate by Mr. Speaker Gordon (Mr. Davis in the
                                    Chair) Mr. Dobbins and Mr. Turpie - 
                                Mr. BRANHAM demanded the previous question, and there being a
                                    second, the main question was ordered and taken, viz: on the
                                    adoption of the amendment of Mr. Davis to the sixth section, the
                                    vote resulting, yeas 54, nays 45.
                                So the amendment was adopted: Mr. Turpie filing his motion to
                                    reconsider this vote; which was subsequently lost.
                                On motion by Mr. STANFIELD (the order of business being suspended
                                    for the purpose) the bill and amendment was considered as
                                    engrossed, and passed the third and last reading in the House of

                                FUND COMMISSIONERS BILL.
                                On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the special order, to wit: the
                                    consideration of the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means' bill (H. R. 72) to provide for the election
                                    of a Board of Fund Commissioners, &c., on the second reading
                                    thereof - 
                                The bill was read through by the Clerk.
                                Mr. DAVIS proposed to amend the 19th section by adding :
                                    "Provided however, that this Act shall only remain in force for
                                    the period of three years from and after its passage."
                                The SPEAKER. The bill is on the third reading.
                                Mr. DAVIS was willing to go for the bill as a temporary measure,
                                    but would hardly give it support as a permanent measure. Was
                                    there any mode provided for the care and management of those
                                    funds when the term of the present Fund Commissioners shall
                                    expire?
                                Mr. COLGROVE. There was no such provision of law.
                                Mr. DAVIS. Then I can support it as a temporary measure.
                                Mr. EDWARDS insisted that the bill was still on the second
                                    reading, the question being on engrossment.
                                Mr. COLGROVE. The bill has never been ordered to be
                                    engrossed.
                                The SPEAKER. The Chair has been misled by the record. The
                                    question is on the amendment.
                                Mr. SMITH, of Perry, addressed the House in favor of, and in
                                    explanation of the bill.
                                Mr. Davis' amendment was adopted.
                                Mr. HARNEY took the floor in opposition to the bill, and on his
                                    motion, at 4:20 o'clock,
                                The House adjourned.

                            Mr. BEESON presented the memorial of an Indiana Yearly Meeting,
                                composed of that portion of the religious society of Friends,
                                residing in the western part of Ohio, and eastern and northern parts
                                of Indiana, and in the State of Iowa, respectfully asking the

                                from the sale and use of intoxicating liquors.
                            The memorial was read through.
                            Mr. BEESON moved its reference to the Temperance
                                    Committee, and it was so referred.

                            On motion by Mr. MURRAY, the bill was considered as engrossed, read

                                was referred Mr. Hamilton's bill (S. 21) to amend an Act concerning
                                real property and the alienation thereof, approved May 6,1852;
                                reported the same back and recommended its passage, with an
                                amendment striking out the word "purchase," so that the section will
                                read, "any alien may acquire and hold lands by [purchase] devise or
                                design.

                            The PRESIDENT (Mr. Cravens in the Chair) decided that it required the

                                it, with reference to the election of Bright and Fitch as Senators,
                                either for or against.
                            Mr. WALLACE, when his name was called, said he should vote no,
                                because he wished to mature and pass the bill of his own upon the
                                same subject.
                            So the bill passed.

                                proceed to choose such Senator.
                            Mr. HEFFREN said he should oppose the bill because he believed it to
                                be in conflict with the Constitution of the United States.
                            Mr. WALLACE spoke in favor of his bill; explaining its features and
                                urging its importance. During his remarks he said: Will the Senator
                                from Washington (Mr. Heffren) tell me that if all the other counties
                                of the State should vote for and designate a Republican for United
                                States Senator, and his counties should be the only ones voting no,
                                it would be right for him to come up here and vote to refuse to
                                carry out the will of the people of the State?
                            Mr. HEFFREN. Yes, sir. I most certainly would.
                            Mr. Wallace's motion was agreed to.
                            The PRESIDENT (Mr. Craven in the Chair) appointed Messrs. Wallace,
                                Gooding, Tarkington, March and Anthony said committee.
                            And then the Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON moved to suspend the rules and take up Mr. Heffren's
                                bill (85) to suppress the circulation of shinplasters.
                            The motion was rejected.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved to proceed to the orders of the day, and take up
                                bills from the House on the third reading
                            Mr. TARKINGTON made an ineffectual move to lay this motion on the
                                table.
                            The motion was agreed to.

                                    repeal an act prohibiting the manufacture and sale of spirituous

                                    was read through the third time.
                                The question being: Shall the bill pass, a constitutional
                                    provision demanding the yeas and nays, they were ordered, and

                                                Shoemaker, Slack, Studabaker, Tarkington, Wallace,

                                                - 11.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. BOBBS, when his name was called, said that when on the stump,
                                    he told his constituents he would vote neither for nor against
                                    the repeal of this law unless he was instructed. He refused to
                                    vote.
                                Mr. MARCH, when his name was called, said he never was an admirer
                                    of this law, but as the Supreme Court has repealed all that part
                                    of the law which was objectionable, he saw no necessity to go
                                    through the form of repeal until we get some law in its
                                    place.
                                Mr. MURRAY, when his name was called, said: I voted for this bill
                                    four years ago, believing it to be right, and I believe it to be
                                    so now, but the Supreme Court have riddled the thing so as to
                                    leave nothing of the original bill.
                                Mr. STEVENS, when his name was called, said, he did not like to
                                    vote for the repeal of this law because it will leave no law
                                    upon the subject on the Statute books. He would vote for the
                                    repeal of this law if we had any law on the subject in
                                    existence.
                                So the bill passed.
                                The title of the bill was then read and adopted.

                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            THURSDAY, December 16, 1858.

                            LIQUOR TRAFFIC.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Wayne, submitted the memorial of the Eastern Indiana
                                Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends, praying for a law to
                                prohibit the Liquor Traffic, which was read and referred to the
                                    Committe on Temperance.
                        
                        
                            ORGANIZATION OF COURTS.
                            Mr. BAIRD, from the Committee on Organization of Courts of
                                    Justice, returned the resolution to abolish the Court
                                of Common Pleas, &c., and reported a bill (No. 93) to repeal the
                                act establishing Courts of Common Pleas, and defining the
                                jurisdiction and duties of the judges thereof.
                            Also a bill (No. 94) to provide for the organization of Circuit
                                Courts, for the election of the Judges thereof, and to define the
                                powers, duties and jurisdiction of said Courts; to fix the Judge's
                                salaries, and the number of terms of said Court; to provide for
                                adjourned terms, and repealing all former laws on the subject.
                            Also a bill (No. 95) giving the clerks of the Circuit Courts probate
                                jurisdiction, defining their powers and duties therein, and fixing
                                their compensation therefor; prohibiting clerks and their deputies
                                from practicing law, prescribing penalties therefor; and repealing
                                all laws in conflict with this act.
                            Also a bill (No. 96) to provide for the election of, and prescribing
                                certain duties of prosecuting attorneys.
                            Which bills were severally read and passed the first reading.
                            Mr. COLGROVE moved to suspend the rules and taken up the bill (H.
                                R.94) to provide for the organization of the Circuit Courts,
                                &c., with a view to a second reading now and an order to
                                print.
                            Mr. SCOTT was opposed to change, but favored the motion to print,
                                &c.
                            Mr. PARKS thought a test on the question of change should be had at
                                once. He must see the advantages of the new system before he could
                                go for a change, and was opposed to suspending the rules.
                            Mr. PARRETT was rather favorable to the Common Pleas Court as it is,
                                but felt that there was great deficiency in the court system, and
                                desired to see the plan for the proposed change, as matured by its
                                friends, in print.
                            Mr. HALL, of Rush, said it seemed to him  that the proposed increase of the
                                circuits to thirty would not accomplish much in the way of economy.
                                The Judges of Probate were better paid than other judges. He would
                                like to see a reform of the system.
                            Mr. AUSTIN saw no great necessity for hasty action - a suspension of
                                the rules for the second reading of this bill. It was an infraction
                                of a constitutional principle which he desired to respect.
                            Mr. BLYTHE It was not to hasten action on the bills, but to get them
                                before the country for elicitation of opinion thereon - to give time
                                with the means of intelligent reflection.
                            Mr. MURRAY considered the printing would be thrown away. He preferred
                                first to test the question of the abolition of the Courts of Common
                                Pleas by resolution.
                            Mr. COLGROVE. The Committee on the Organization of
                                    Courts had had that question before them for ten days,
                                and came to the conclusion to do so upon considerations of economy,
                                and now it would be discourteous to disregard their labors, or
                                prevent the examination of the results of their labors - the bills
                                they have now reported. If they were printed now, we could act
                                intelligently upon the subject in the coming regular session.
                            Mr. BAIRD. There could not be a test question on a motion to suspend
                                the rules.
                            Mr. AUSTIN. He had only made a constitutional objection.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY. A suspension of the rules was due to the committee
                                reporting these bills, which had been prepared, evidently, with much
                                care.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone. The intention was to print two of the bills
                                and leave the other two.
                            Mr. COLGROVE. The other two did not embrace the matter of change
                                which should go to the people.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone, concurred with the gentleman from Wayne.
                            Mr. MURRAY protested against this principle of sweeping out old
                                systems and instituting new ones every time the Legislature ccmes
                                together.
                            Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren, wished to print.
                            The rules were suspended by yeas 85, nays 12, and the bill (94) was
                                read the second time by title.
                            Mr. COLGROVE moved that the bill lay on the table, and that 300 be
                                printed.
                            Mr. CLEMENTS proposed 500 copies.
                            Mr. COLGROVE accepted, and the order was made accordingly.
                        
                        
                            FUND COMMISSIONERS' BILL.
                            On motion by Mr. MELLETT, the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means' bill (H. R. 72) was taken up and recommitted
                                with the following instructions:
                            Prepare and report four bills, embracing the subjects contained in
                                said bill, each bill to embrace but one subject, and matters
                                properly connected therewith, according to the constitutional
                                provision, as follows:
                            
                                Providing for the election of Sinking Fund
                                    Commissioners, and prescribing their duties, term of office and
                                    compensation.
                                Appropriating certain funds to meet the interest on the
                                    public debt, pay the current expenses of the State Government
                                    and repay the money borrowed for such purposes.
                                Establishing tha salary of State Treasurer and defining
                                    his duties.
                                Providing for the punishment of persons having the
                                    management of the public funds for making false drafts, checks,
                                    entries or records.
                            
                        
                        
                            PROBATE BUSINESS.
                            On motion by Mr. PARRETT (the rules being suspended for the purpose)
                                the committee's bil (H. R. 95) giving the Clerks of the Circuit
                                Courts probate jurisdiction, &c., was con sidered and read the
                                second time by its title.
                            On motion by Mr. GRIFFIN, the bill was laid on the table and 500
                                copies ordered to be printed.
                        
                        
                            HOUSES OF REFUGE.
                            The SPEAKER now announced the select committee on Mr. Dobbins'
                                resolution relative to the subject of the erection of houses of
                                refuge, namely: Messrs. Dobbins, Davis,Branham, Robinson, Jeffries,
                                Whetzel, Edwards, Harney, Merrifield, Wheeler and Hall, of Grant -

                            PETIT JURORS.
                            Mr. BLYTHE, from the select committee on that subject, returned the
                                bill (H. R. 61) prescribing the manner of empanneling petit jurors,
                                recommending that the same do pass.
                            The report was concurred in, and the bill was ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                        
                        
                            GAME LAW.
                            Mr. SCOTT, from a majority of the select committee on that subject,
                                returned Mr. Turpie's bill (H. R. 16) to repeal the Game Law, and
                                the memorial thereon, and recommended the indefinite postponement of

                                    lost.
                                On motion of Mr. TURPIE, the bill was referred to the
                                        Committee on Ways and Means.
                            
                            
                                FUND COMMISSIONERS - STATE DEBT.
                                Mr. BRANHAM, from the Committee on Ways and
                                        Means, the rules being suspended for the purpose,
                                    introduced a bill (No. 98) to provide for the election of a
                                    Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners, prescribing their duties,
                                    term of office and compensation.
                                Also a bill (No. 99) appropriating certain funds to meet the
                                    interest on the public debt, to pay the current expenses of the
                                    State Government, and repay money borrowed for such
                                    purpose,which bills were read through and passed the first
                                    reading.
                                On motion by Mr. HUNTER, the rule being suspended for the
                                    purpose, the bill (H. R. 99) was read the second time by its
                                    title.
                                Mr. HARNEY gave his views in opposition to this measure of
                                    finance. He was obliged to consider it in connection with the
                                    succeeding bill, providing for carrying on the State Government.
                                    He objected to the provisions allowing the commissioners to fix
                                    their own fees; to the provision authorizing them to use the
                                    State credit without restriction of law any more than that now
                                    thrown around the Treasurer of State. The Sinking Fund was held
                                    by the State in a fiduciary capacity. If money is worth seven
                                    per cent, where was the propriety in the State's taking it at
                                    six per cent.? The use of the bonds there, as collateral
                                    security, was also objectionable. There was the same objections
                                    here, as that urged against the Treasurer loaning out the public
                                    money. The manner of taking up the Bank Bond debt was very
                                    indefinitely pointed out, &c.
                                Mr. BRANHAM replied. Six per cent, was a better per cent, than
                                    seven on mortgages. There was frequently large amounts on hand
                                    which were not used. The present law will continue to prescribe
                                    the use of this fund, but probably there would be no surplus on
                                    hand. How would the gentleman pay the January interest? He could
                                    show that the administration of this bill would result in the
                                    advantage of the State as well as of the fund. The School Fund
                                    could not be appropriated until the bank bonds are redeemed. It
                                    must be loaned to somebody, and should not the State be a
                                    preferred borrower? We propose not to borrow till we need it;
                                    and then to pay back to the fund from which we borrow, on a day
                                    certain. It was to be regarded as a sacred fund.
                                Mr. COLGROVE. The printed bill seems to have been divided up into
                                    two or three.
                                Mr. SMITH, of Perry. The bill (98) contains the first eleven
                                    sections, and the 17th section of the printed bill. The other
                                    bill (99) contains the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17:h, 18th
                                    and 20th sections. The 19th section, with reference to the
                                    penalty, was referred to the Committee on the
                                        Judiciary.
                                On motion by Mr. HUNTER, the bill was referred to a select
                                    committee of five, which the SPEAKER makes to consist of Messrs.
                                    Hunter, Colgrove, Branham, Smith, of Perry, and Mellett.
                                Mr. COLGROVE proposed to instruct the said committee to
                                    amendstriking out objectionable matter, and leaving the feature
                                    of the election of Fund Commissioners, and the transference of
                                    the management of the finances from the Treasurer to the
                                    Commissioners. But his amendments would be fatal to the
                                    bill.
                                The SPEAKER. There is nothing before the House.
                                On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, (the rules being suspended for the
                                    purpose,) the bill (H. R. 98) was now considered on the second
                                    reading.
                                Mr. HUNTER moved that it be referred to the select committee on
                                    the bill No. 99.
                                Mr. HARNEY moved to refer it to the Committee on the
                                        Sinking Fund - demanding the yeas and nays
                                    thereon.
                                Mr. COLGROVE. The 11th and 12th sections contained the matter
                                    about which there would be controversy - the balance would be
                                    free from objection. He desired a test vote on a motion to
                                    strike out these sections.
                                Mr. Harney and Mr. Hunter withdrew their motions for this
                                    purpose, and Mr. Colgrove submitted his amendment.
                                Mr. COLGROVE read the 11th and 12th sections, authorizing the
                                    Fund Commissioners to pay the State Treasurer's checks for the
                                    current expenses of the State; and, if the cash means in said
                                    Fund should be insufficient therefor, to negotiate a loan or use
                                    collaterally any seccurities in their hands- The surplus of
                                    revenue beyond the payment of the interest on the State debt to
                                    be applied to the purchase of certificates of the foreign debt
                                    of the State: and he proceeded to object to the conferment of
                                    this discretion. If the State becomes a borrower of this Fund,
                                    she should do so on the same terms which any individual may do
                                    so. Besides, this Fund was sacred to common schools. To show
                                    that the interests of this Fund would be jeoparded by the bill,
                                    he rehearsed that the State was already debtor to the Fund to
                                    the extent of $616,681 44 in principal. This should have been
                                    entitled to compound interest at 7 per cent.; and the Fund had.
                                    in this way, lost already $1,200.000. He spoke more at length,
                                    stating his preference to go into the market for money, and
                                    strenuously opposing those propositions to make no distinction
                                    between the School Fund and any other fund.
                                
                                [A Senate message announced their passage of bills to amend
                                    section 3 of the Misdemeanor Act of June 14, 1852; to prohibit
                                    clerks and their deputies from practising law; to amend section
                                    196 of the Law Reform Act of June 18,1852; to amend sections 1
                                    and 2 of the Railroad Accident Act of March 1, 1852, and to
                                    provide the manner of process; and to change the time of the
                                    election of members of Congress, and provide for the same.]
                                Mr. BRANHAM. Part of the speech of the gentleman ought to have
                                    been made seventeen years ago. He would repay that debt,
                                    principal and interest. Our bonds in New York could not be
                                    negotiated for less than six per cent, interest if we buy bonds,
                                    it is at par, and we borrow money at six per cent to do it. That
                                    was the gentleman's proposition. The question was as to the
                                    place where we should go to borrow. Should we not go where we
                                    could get it cheapest? The bill proposes that we borrow and
                                    appropriate by distinct amounts. If gentlemen will wait, we will
                                    tell precisely the amounts we shall borrow, and then we restrict
                                    the Commissioners in the use of these specific appropriations.
                                    Loans on mortgages did not net the fund five per cent., and the
                                    managenent of that fund, for integrity and fidelity, was without
                                    a parrallel in the management of trusts.
                                On motion by Mr. BLYTHE, Mr. Colgrove's amendment was referred to
                                    the Committee on Ways and Means.
                                Mr. BLYTHE renewed the motion to refer to the select committee on
                                    the bill (99) which was agreed to.
                            
                            
                                LECTURE IN THE BAPTIST CHURCH.
                                The SPEAKER read to the House a letter of invitation "to members
                                    and Clerks of the General Assembly to attend a lecture before

                            FRIDAY, December 17,1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read - Mr. Tarkington in the Chair, by

                            REVENUE FOR 1859 AND 1860.
                            Mr. RICE, from the Committee on Finance, to whom
                                was referred the bill (H. R.
                                    73) to raise a revenue for State purposes for the years
                                1859 and 1860; reported the same back and recommended its
                                passage.
                            The report was concurred in, and the bill read the second time.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved that the bill be now considered as engrossed and
                                read the third time.
                            The motion was agreed to by yeas 30, nays 18.
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved to recommit to the Committee on
                                    Finance with instructions to amend by adding in the
                                proper place, 15 cents on the hundred dollars, and 50 cents on each
                                poll for the year 1858.

                                            Heffren, Jennings, Johnston, Lomax, Miller, O'Brien,
                                            Odell, Shoemaker, Slack, Studabaker, Tarkington, and
                                            Williams - 17.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BLAIR moved to recommit with instructions to strike out "20
                                cents" [on each $100 for 1859,] and insert "15 cents."
                            Mr. GREEN was in favor of this motion.
                            Mr. WEIR was opposed to it. He thought 20 cents would hardly be
                                enough.
                            Mr. SLACK thought 10 cents would be enough. He thought there would be
                                eight hundred millions of dollars of taxables under the new
                                Appraisement law, and 10 per cent, he thought would be amply
                                sufficient to pay all expenses. It is anti-Democratic to raise more
                                revenue than we need, and consequently he was opposed to it. He
                                thought every county would be doubled and thribbled in taxables
                                under the new appraisement.
                            Mr. ANTHONY has had no time to make calculations, but was satisfied
                                with the estimate made. He would think the amount was too low, but
                                we have no data by which we could come to any satisfactory
                                conclusions.
                            Mr. RICE said the committee relied upon the data and calculations
                                made by the Committee on Ways and Means in the
                                House of Representatives. He was opposed to the amendment, and was
                                in favor of 20 cents on the $100 for 1859 because the people had
                                been relieved from this tax for the present year, and he believed it
                                would not be too much.
                            Mr. BOBBS was in favor of the proposition of the Senator from
                                Hendricks, [Mr. Blair] but was in favor of the tax being 20 cents on
                                the $100 for 1860.
                            Mr. HEFFREN was anxious to pay off the indebtedness now hanging over
                                the State. He was in favor of levying a sufficient tax to pay the
                                interest on the State debt, and carry on the government, and was
                                opposed to borrowing money for these purposes.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON offered an amendment to the instructions to the
                                committee, viz: to strike out all that part of the bill which
                                relates to the year 1860.
                            Mr. CRAVENS was opposed to the amendment and the amendment to the
                                amendment. We are assembled for the purpose of devising ways and
                                means for carrying on this government; and he was in favor of so
                                doing. Nearly all the trust funds are calling for the return of
                                moneys borrowed by the Legislature from them, and consequently he
                                was in favor of levying 20 cents on the $100 for 1859.
                            Mr. ANTHONY moved to lay the amendment and the amendment to the
                                amendment on the table; but withdrew for - 
                            Mr. WEIR, who wished to say that the calculations of the Senator from
                                Huntington [Mr. Slack] must be
                                wrong - the taxables of the State would not come up to his figures.
                                He renewed the motion of the Senator from Floyd [Mr. Anthony] to lay
                                the amendment on the table.
                            Mr. HEFFREN called for a division of the question.The question being
                                upon the motion to lay on the table the instructions of the Senator
                                from Putnam (Mr. Johnston) - 
                            The motion was agreed to by yeas 34, nays 16.
                            The question recurring on the motion to lay on the table Mr. Blair's
                                motion to refer with instructions - 
                            The motion was agreed to by yeas 37, nays 12.
                            In accordance with the first vote taken, the bill was read through
                                the third time.
                            The question being: Shall the bill pass? A constitutional provision
                                demanding the yeas and nays, they were ordered, and being taken,
                                resulted - yeas 42, nays 7 - Messrs. Conley, Heffren, Jennings,
                                Johnston, Slack, Wallace and Williams.
                            Absent - Mr. Cooper.
                            So the bill passed.
                            The title was read and adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            SAFEKEEPING OF THE PUBLIC TREASURE.
                            Mr. HEFFREN, from the same committee, to whom was referred Mr.
                                Tarkington's bill (S. 55) to provide for the safe keeping of public
                                moneys, stocks, bonds and other securities entrusted to the care of
                                public officers, reported the same back and recommended its
                                passage.
                            The report was concurred in by consent, the bill read through the
                                second time.
                            Mr. HEFFKEN moved to re-commit, witn instructions to strike out the
                                words "public moneys," wherever they occur. By the provisions of the
                                bill it would be the duty of the Treasurer of State to take all the
                                paper money collected and pile it up in a saferunning the risk of
                                the banks breakingthere being no provision allowing him to deposit
                                in any banking institution.
                            Mr. CONNER moved to add to the instructions the following: Insert in
                                the proper place "That the Treasurer of State shall account for all
                                interest received by him on deposits or otherwise as Treasurer."
                            This amendment was discussed by Messrs. Heffren, Conner, Steele,
                                Weir, Wagner and Murray.
                            Mr. HAMILTON moved to lay the bill and pending amendments on the
                                table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            RAILROAD TAXATION.
                            Mr. HENDRY, from the Judiciary Committee, to whom
                                was referred Mr. Miller's bill (S
                                    5) to amend the 32d section of an act to provide for the
                                valuation and assessment of real and personal property, collect
                                taxes, &c., approved June 21,1852, reported the same back with
                                an amendment.
                            Mr. MILLER hoped the Senate would consent, that the bill may be
                                considered as engrossed and read a third time now. He made that
                                motion.
                            The report was concurred in, and the bill read by its title the
                                second time.
                            Mr. Miller's motion was agreed to, and the bill was read through the
                                third time.
                            Mr. HENDRY. The amendment simply dissevers the lands lying distant
                                from railroad beds, and requires them to be taxed in the counties in
                                which they lie, but leaves the law taxing the rolling stock,
                                railroad bed and depots just as it stands now.
                            The bill was finally passed the Senate by yeas 48, nays 1 - Mr.
                                Wallace.
                            Absent - Mr. Cooper.
                            The title was then read and adopted by consent.
                        
                        
                            TITLE OF A LAW REFORM ACT.
                            Mr. GOODING, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                to whom was referred Mr. Murray's bill (S. 52) to amend the title of
                                the law reform act, approved June 21, 1852, reported the same back,
                                and recommended that it be laid on the table.
                            The report was concurred in.
                            Mr. SLACK, from the Judiciary Committee, to whom
                                was referred a resolution diricting the committee to inquire whether
                                legislation is necessary to perfect the law in reference to the
                                conviction of felons, when more than one conviction has been had
                                against one person at the same court, and report by bill or
                                otherwise, reported a bill (S. 104) in compliance with the same.
                            The report was concurred in by consent.
                            Mr. Slack's bill (S. 104) to provide for the infliction of punishment
                                where more than one conviction has been had against one person at
                                the same term of the courts in this State; was read through the
                                first time.
                            [This bill provides that punishment assessed upon the same person at
                                the second conviction takes place after the expiration of the first
                                sentence.]
                            Mr. BENNETT,from the Judiciary Committee, to whom
                                was referred the bill (H. R. 18) to amend the 18th section of an act
                                prescribing the powers and duties of Justices of the Peace, &c.,
                                approved May 27,1858; reported the same back, and recommended its
                                passage.
                            Mr. MARCH said he dissented to the will of the majority of the
                                committee, but would not delay the action of the Senate at this
                                time.
                            The report was concurred in and the bill passed to the third
                                reading.
                            Mr. ANTHONY, from the Judiciary Committee, to whom
                                was referred Mr. Rice's bill (S. 71) to amend section 6 of an act to
                                provide for the valuation, assessment and collection of taxes in the

                                with an amendment, and recommended its adoption.
                            The report was concurred in and the bill passed the second
                                reading.
                        
                        
                            JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.
                            Mr. COBB, from the Judiciary Committee, to whom
                                was referred Mr. Conley's bill (S. 40) to amend section 10 of an act

                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            RAILROAD LIABILITY.
                            Mr. CONNER, from the Judiciary Committee,  to whom was referred a
                                resolution inquiring whether the General Assembly can pass a law
                                compelling railroad companies to pay for the killing of animals
                                where railroads can not be fenced, reported that, in their opinion,
                                the General Assembly has the power to pass such a law.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            EXEMPTION OF PROPERTY FROM SALE.
                            Mr. McLEAN,from the Judiciary Committee, to whom
                                was referred his bill (S. 46) to amend section 9 of an act to exempt

                            Mr. WALLACE supported his resolution, and was followed by Messrs.

                                    the bill back with sundry amendments.
                                Mr. HEFFREN stated that the amendments proposed did not change
                                    the bill, but were merely verbal alterations.
                                The report was concurred in, and the bill was considered on its
                                    third reading.
                                Mr. HAMILTON demanded a call of the Senate.
                                The call was proceeled with, when - 
                                On Mr. HENDRY'S motion, further action in the call was dispensed
                                    with.
                                Mr. HEFFREN said in explanation of his bill, that there was no
                                    check upon the Agents of State putting into market any amount of
                                    State stocks, and this bill was for the purpose of remedying
                                    this, and putting a stop to all avenues for fraudulent
                                    issues.

                                REAPPRAISEMENT BILL.

                                    counties.]
                                The report was concurred in, and the committee discharged.
                            
                            
                                COMMON SCHOOLS.
                                The PRESIDENT pro tem, announced the special
                                    order - being Mr. Wagner's bill (S. 26) supplementary to an act
                                    to provide for a general system of commrn schools, approved
                                    March 5, 1855.
                                Mr. MURRAY moved that the Senate resolve itself into a Committee
                                    of the Whole on this bill.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                The Senate accordingly resolved itself into a Committee of the
                                    Whole - the President pro tem, calling; Mr.
                                    Murray to the Chair.
                                Mr. WAGNER spoke at length in support of his bill, explaining its
                                    provisions and urging the importance of early action
                                    thereon.
                                
                                He was followed by Messrs. Studabaker, Hendry, Bennett, Green and
                                    Bobbs.
                                Mr. CRAVENS said a number of dicta of the Supreme Court has been
                                    read here; and there was truly a constitutional question
                                    involved in I the distribution of this common school fund. He
                                    was in favor of the bill; if he thought it would be a blow
                                    against the common school system he should vote against it.
                                Mr. ANTHONY said that the proposed bill was constitutional.
                                When he had concluded - 
                                Mr. HEFFREN moved that the committee rise, report progress, and
                                    ask leave to sit again.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                The committee accordingly rose and the President, pro tem, resumed the Chair.
                                Mr. MURRAY, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, said, Mr.
                                    President: The Committee of the Whole Senate have had under
                                    consideration the Senate bill No. 26, and after some time spent
                                    therein without coming to any conclusion, have directed me to
                                    report progress, and ask leave of the Senate to sit again.
                                The report was concurred in by consent.
                                And then the Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            FRIDAY, December 17,1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read.
                        
                            FUND COMMISSIONERS.
                            Mr. HAMILTON (the order of business being suspended for the purpose)
                                from the majority of the select committee on the bill (H. R. 98) for
                                the election of Sinking Fund Commissioners, returned the same, with
                                an amendment in the seventh section, striking out the words "also,
                                elect assistants if necessary."
                            The report was concurred in.
                            Mr. MURRAY submitted the following objections to the passage of the
                                bill:
                            
                                That it works an uncertain and radical change in our
                                    whole financial system.
                                That the State has not in times past refunded the school
                                    funds she has used, and is not likely to do so in time to
                                    come.
                                That there is no more restriction of this Board to a
                                    free use of the public funds than to the Treasurer of State,
                                    against whose practice such universal complaints are
                                    made.
                                That this Board is not properly restricted as to the
                                    amount of fees or salaries for official services rendered by
                                    officers thereof.
                                That the system, is planned for a permanent instead of a
                                    temporary purpose, alone warranted by the exigencies of the
                                    State.
                                 That upon principles of safety to the public funds, I
                                    would prefer to limit and restrict one man in the capacity of
                                    Treasurer to a proper discharge of his duties, than a board of
                                    five men.
                                That at the foundation of the whole scheme I think there
                                    is an opportunity for this board to transfer our school funds
                                    into banking funds, for the use of speculators. For these
                                    reasons I shall vote against the whole scheme.
                            
                            Mr. STANFIELD proposed to amend the compensation clause, by striking
                                out and inserting these words: "The salary of the President of said
                                Board shall not exceed $2,000, nor shall the salary of any assistant
                                exceed $800 per annum."
                            Mr. KEEFER proposed $1,500 for the President, and $2 a day for the
                                assistant, when actually employed.
                            Which was accepted, and so the amendment was agreed to.
                            Mr. STANFIELD proposed further to amend by adding:
                            Section - This act shall not be in force more than three years from
                                and after its passage.
                            The amendment was adopted.
                            Mr. STANFIELD proposed further to amend, by adding a section to the
                                following effect - doubting, however, about its
                                constitutionality:
                            Section That any officer or member of said Board, who shall directly
                                or indirectly take to his own use or benefit, the interest for the
                                use, loan or deposit of said fund, shall be guilty of felony, and
                                upon conviction thereof, shall be fined to any sum not exceeding
                                double the amount so used, and imprisoned in the State Penitentiary
                                for any period not less than two nor more than fourteen years.
                            Which amendment he subsequently withdrew.
                            Mr. MELLETT - the order of business being suspended for this purpose
                                - introduced a bill (No. 100) prohibiting any officer or officers,
                                clerk, deputy, employee, or agent of any officer or officers, having
                                in charge or under their control in any manner the public funds of
                                the State, or of any fund belonging to any county in the State, from
                                making any fraudulent draft or entry, &c, declaring the same to
                                be a felony, and providing punishment therefor - [fines in double
                                the amount involved in the fraud, and imprisons not less than two
                                nor more than fourteen 3 years,] which was passed the first
                                reading.
                            On the further motion of Mr. MELLETT the rules being suspended by
                                yeas 93, nays 3 - the bill was read the second time by title.
                            Mr. STANFIELD proposed to amend by adding, appropriately, these
                                words: "Or who shall fail or refuse, at the expiration of his term
                                of office, to account for and pay over to his successor in office
                                all interests, premiums or compensations, directly or indirectly
                                received by him for the use of such fund."
                            Mr. EDWARDS proposed to amend the amendment, by inserting after the
                                word "office" these words: "or when required by the proper
                                authorities."
                            Mr. STANFIELD accepted, and so the amendment was adopted.
                            The bill was then ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr PROSSER alleged that it would be necessary further to amend the
                                bill (No. 98) to make it conform to the restrictions of the time for
                                the act to continue in force.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY. It seemed to him the difficulty could be obviated by
                                striking out the 11th and 12th sections of the bill.
                            The SPEAKER. The gentleman refers to the other bill - the bill (No.
                                99) to pay the interest on the public debt.
                            The bill (98) was then ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. STANFIELD. His amendment in regard to limitation applied only to
                                that particular section.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry, moved a reconsideration of the vote, reducing
                                the salary of the President, of the Board, and the compensation of
                                the clerks. He said: If you
                                desired a good clerk, Mr. Speaker, and put him behind the counter,
                                near the money till, giving seventy-five dollars a year, and telling
                                him he must dress well, what would be the result? I am disposed to
                                give for public service every dollar it is worth, and I want the
                                best man I can get. I say to you, neither of these rates of
                                compensation is sufficient to obtain a man of first-rate capacity; a
                                responsible business man, I mean - not loafers about the Capitol. No
                                responsible man could take this position for such a compensation,
                                unless he expected outside advantages. If you expect a man to do
                                your business well and right, you must pay him. A bare book-keeper
                                can go to your cities arid get [?],000 a year, without giving a bond
                                for $200,000 
                            Mr. DAVIS. It did not appear to him that the President of this Board
                                should have better pay than the Governor or the Judges of the State.
                                Fifteen hundred dollars would be much better pay to this officer,
                                than the pay of those officers, State and Judicial, whose functions
                                require brains. The highest qualification of the President of this
                                Board was an indisposition to steal. The Secretary of the present
                                Board (Mr. Ray) was entitled to the highest credit for his
                                management of that fund, but as for the members of the Board, they
                                had nothing to do with it. They were put there, probably, because
                                they believed in certain political doctrines. Whilst he would fix
                                this officer's pay at a liberal rate he would not go so high as to
                                render him rich out the school fund, which was sacred to the
                                children of the State.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry, had been endeavoring laboriously, as a member of
                                the Committee on Ways and Means, to ascertain the
                                condition of these funds and accounts; and the office of the Board
                                of Sinking Fund Commissioners was the only place he had been able to
                                find the information he desired. He had found there every paper in
                                place, numbered, dated and filed with care; and this induced him at
                                first to think of the office of the Sinking Fund Board as the proper
                                place for the deposit of these funds, until a suitable place could
                                be provided - the object here being simply to find, for a limited
                                period, a safe depository of the public funds. He was not content to
                                let this matter remain as it is. It was not for the mere exhibition
                                of skill that a man would be induced to enter upon a public trust
                                like this. He had heard of such a thing as honor; and when the
                                public have need or a judge, there is a legal representation in the
                                case to induce a man to take a judicial position. But in the case of
                                the President of a Board, or of a Bank, there is not a professional
                                reputation nor anything to be obtained which pays a man better than
                                money. No man could have a more clear and practical know-lege of
                                everything concerning finance than Mr. Ray, the present Secretary of
                                this Board. He understood the business thoroughly, and was better
                                worth $10,000 to the State in that capacity, than any mere
                                politician could be worth one dollar. But there was no reputation
                                connected with his position; it was merely working in the line of
                                his duty for the support of his family. And should we cut that man
                                down to $2 a day?
                            He had learned this morning for the first time, that the accounting
                                officer of the Treasurer had already borrowed the amount ($165,000)
                                we want to pay the January instalment of interest, and if that were
                                the case it is useless for us to be legislating here - sitting here
                                in grave council in this extra session - while the whole business is
                                being done for us without our knowledge or advice. We might as well
                                go home at once, if the officers of State undertake to make all
                                these financial arrange merits, without deigning to give us the
                                slightest notification of their proceedings. It might be well enough
                                for them, as prudent men, to be commencing negotiations for a loan,
                                in case the General Assembly should not be ready, but certainly a
                                proper sense of courtesy would call for their strict advisement with
                                the Committee on Ways and Means. But he now
                                learned, that whilst we are debating here the ways and means of
                                making the loan, the payment is probably on the way to New York.
                            He submited a statement of figures, of the present available amount
                                in the Treasury - $111-121; of the objectionable and
                                unconstitutional mode of managing the public finances - the State
                                Treasurer giving acceptances - the probability that $50,000 had been
                                issued without the color of a warrant, &c. He gave the State
                                Auditor due credit for his prudence, in retaining in his hands some
                                $20,000 belonging to the State debt sinking fund, but there was
                                neither law nor reason tor the last year's loan of $165,000, and
                                exposing the State to the interest, &c., when there appeared to
                                be over $500,000 in the Treasury.
                            He reiterated the absurdity of the idea of two dollars a day for the
                                services of such a man as James M. Ray. No man fit for such a trust
                                could be obtained for less than $2,000 a year.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY The amendment was only to apply to the Assistant Clerk,
                                not the Principal Clerk. The duties of the President and Board were
                                more onerous under the old system, than they would be under the new;
                                because the fund would be used by the State, and not loaned out in
                                small sums. The salary of the President, at $1,500 a year, he
                                thought, would be ample. The record of the management of this fund
                                was the best eulogy that could be pronounced upon the old Board.
                                They never held their places as political partisans.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry. The amendment would embrace the menials of the
                                office. The first object of the Board was to get competent men for
                                these four Commissioners. The Commissioners would best know what
                                would be reasonable for their compensation. He had no knowledge of
                                the old Board. He had looked at them as the controllers of a fund
                                that had been kept in capital, good condition. He supposed these
                                Commissioners should be selected as good and true men, without
                                reference to party affiliation.
                            [A Senate message, announced their passage, without amendment, of the
                                bill (H. R. 73) to raise a
                                revenue for the years 1859, 1860.]
                            The vote on Mr. Stanfield's amendment was reconsidered, and the
                                question recurring on its adoption
                            Mr. MURRAY proposed, ineffectually, to make the President's salary
                                $1,000.
                            Mr. MELTETT proposed $1,500 a sthe salary of the Clerk of this
                                fund.
                            Which was agreed to.

                                            Sherman, Shields, Smith of Miami, Smith of Perry,
                                            Stiles, Stinson, Tebbs, Treadway, Whetzel, Whiteman,
                                            Wildman and Mr. Speaker - 53.
                                    
                                
                            
                            So the House refused to lay on the table.
                            Mr. DAVIS could not support the bills in their present shape, but his
                                position to the subject and to the friends of these bills required
                                that he should state his position to it. He moved to postpone its
                                consideration till 2 o'clock.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. The friends of the bill did not wish to restrict debate.
                                The question was whether we should supply the means to pay the
                                January interest. The House ought to say whether this shall be done
                                by them, or by parties unknown to the Constitution.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry, did not object to the limitation to three years,
                                though they had drawn the bill to be self-continuing.
                            The SPEAKER. That amendment is adopted.
                            Mr. Davis' motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            INTEREST ON THE PUBLIC DEBT.
                            Mr. HUNTER, from a majority of the select committee on the bill (No.
                                99) appropriating certain funds toward the payment of the interest
                                on the public debt, &c., (the order of business being suspended
                                for the purpose,) returned the bill with an amendment, stiking out
                                "said" and inserting "the" in the first section, and so amended
                                recommended that the bill pass.
                            The report was concurred in - the question being now on
                                engrossment,
                            On motion by Mr. DAVIS, the further consideration of the bill was
                                postponed till 2 o'clock.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the
                                Superintendent of the Insane Hospital, responding to the resolution
                                of Mr. Smith, of Perry.
                        
                        
                            WARMING AND VENTILATING THE CAPITOL.
                            The SPEAKER named the following select committee under Mr. Treadway's
                                resolution on this subject: Messrs. Treadway, Collier, Sherman,
                                Sullivan and Rynerson.
                        
                        
                            DEFECTIVE DEEDS.
                            Mr. GRIFFIN, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned the bill (S. 6) to
                                cure defects in the execution of deeds, &c., and doing away with
                                the ink-scroll in the cases named, without amendment, and
                                recommended its passage.
                            The report was concurred in, and the bill ordered to a third
                                reading.
                            Mr. SCOTT, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned the bill (H. R. 49) regulating the remission of forfeited
                                recognizances, recommending indefinite postponement.
                            The report was concurred in.
                            Mr. CLEMENTS, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                                returned the bill (H. R. 47) to amend the act declaring what shall
                                be a sufficient seal, &c., recommending that it belaid on the
                                table as superceded by pending legislation.
                            The report was concurred in.
                            Mr. RYNERSON, from the Committee on Agriculture,
                                returned the bill to repeal the 73d section of the Assessment Act of
                                June 21, 1852, recommending indefinite postponement.
                            The report was concurred in.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone, from the Committee on
                                    Roads, to whom was referred the bill (H. R. 52) to
                                authorize road companies to consolidate their stock, defining their
                                powers and duties in such cases, recommending its passage.
                            The report was concurred in, and the bill ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                            Mr. HARNEY, from the Committee on Corperations,
                                returned the bill authorizing travel to church, &c., free of
                                toll on the Sabbath day, recommending that the same do pass.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY moved, ineffectually, to lay the bill and report on the
                                table.
                            The report was then concurred in, and the bill was ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                        
                        
                            COMMON PLEAS.
                            Mr. BROTHERTON, from a majority of the Committee on the
                                    Organization of Courts of Justice, returned Mr.
                                Hunter's bill (H. R. 42) to re-rganize the Court of Common Pleas,
                                &c., with he following points of objection:
                            
                                It requires the holding of too many terms.
                                It gives civil jurisdiction in too small amounts.
                                The manner in which the Judge is to be paid will be
                                    entirely inadequate to secure a competent person.
                                It would make litigation more expensive.
                                But two classes of persons would be benefitted - lawyers
                                    and professional jurors; and the least patronage extended to
                                    these two classes, be better is it for the community.
                            
                            For these reasons the committee returning the bill recommend that it
                                be laid on the table.
                            Mr. HUNTER, from the minority of the same committee, submitted a
                                minority report in writing, Answering the objections of the
                                majority, and recommending the passage of the bill.
                            Mr. DOBBINS made an ineffectual motion to lay the subject on the
                                table.
                            Mr. HUNTER supported the bill upon the reasoning submitted in the
                                minority report, suggesting an amendment which would require the
                                payment, by the plaintiff, of the docket fee in advance. He
                                contended that the pay of the judge would be ample to command the
                                services of men of adequate talent, &c. When he had concluded - 
                            The House took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The House resumed the consideration of Mr. Stanfield's amendment to
                                the bill (H. R. 98.)

                        REPORTERS.
                    
                        Vol. I.
                        INDIANAPOLIS, DEC. 23, 1858.
                        No. 15.
                    
                    
                        
                            Mr. STANFIELD proposed to modify his amendment so as to read as
                                follows:
                            "That the President and employes of said Board shall receive such
                                salaries and compensations as may be allowed by said Board, until
                                their salaries and compensations shall be fixed by law."
                            After debate by Messrs. Davis, Hunter, Turpie, Austin, Dobbins,
                                Ritter, Mellett, Gififord and Hall of Rush, pending which - 
                            [A Senate message announced the concurrence of that body in the
                                report of the conference committee on the disagreeing votes with
                                reference to certain amendments of the House of Representa tives to
                                the bill (S 3) for the
                                reappraisement of real estate, and the passage of the bill (S 53)
                                providing for the transfer of certificates of State stocks, for the
                                registry of the same, &c.] - 
                            On motion by Mr. CLEMENTS, the further consideration of the subject
                                was postponed, and it was made the special order for to-morrow
                                morning, 9 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            APPRAISEMENT BILL.
                            Mr. STANFIELD, from the Committee of Free
                                    Conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses
                                of the General Assembly respecting certain amendments of the House
                                of Representatives to the bill (S.
                                    3) for the appraisement of real estate, reported their
                                agreement to recede from the House amendment to the 1st section; to
                                insist on the House amendments to the 5th section; to substitute for
                                the House amendment to the 24th section a clause striking out so
                                much of the sections 32, 33, 34 of the said appraisement act as are
                                inconsistent with this act. The only change, he said, from the House
                                amendments was in the first section - where the County Commissioners
                                would appoint the deputies.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            MILEAGE.
                            Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren, from the Committee on
                                    Mileage, by unanimous consent, reported the
                                following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the members of this
                                            House be requested on or before Monday next, to hand in
                                            to the Chairman or the Committee on
                                                Mileage, their account of mileage,
                                            computing the distance from their respective residences
                                            to the seat of government, by the usually traveled
                                            route.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The SPEAKER. There is a statute on that subject.
                            Mr. NEBEKER. It is in the exact language of the statute.
                            Mr. CAVINS. The statute was repealed by the last Legislature.
                            The resolution was adopted.
                            And then at 4:40 o'clock the House adjourned.
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            SATURDAY, December 18, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read - Mr. Tarkington still occupying the
                            Chair, in consequence of the continued indisposition of the
                            President.
                        Mr. STEELE presented a petition, from the County Commissioners of Parke
                            county, asking for an explanation of the law in regard to the fees of
                            County Treasurers, which, on his motion, was referred to the
                                Committee on County and Township Business without
                            reading.
                        
                            TRUSTEES OF STATE ASYLUMS.
                            Mr. HEFFREN obtained unanimous consent to offer the following
                                resolution, which was adopted by consent:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Superintendents of
                                            the Hospitals for the insane, the deaf and dumb and the
                                            blind, be requested to report the pay in mileage and per diem of each Trustee thereof,
                                            stating in separate and distinct columns the number of
                                            days each Trustee has received pay for and the mileage
                                            of each for the years 1854, '55, '56, '57 and '58, and
                                            that if the same can not be ascertained in time to
                                            report at the present session, that they report at the
                                            regular session of this body.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            COUNTY BOUNDARIES.
                            Mr. MURRAY, from the Judiciary Committee, to which
                                was referred Mr. Wagner's bill (S. 43) to amend an act to authorize
                                the formation of new counties and to change county boundaries,
                                approved March 7, 1857, reported the same back, and recommended its
                                indefinite postponement.
                            The report was concurred in by consent.
                        
                        
                            BUSINESS OF THE REGULAR SESSION.
                            Mr. CONNER, from the committee to which was referred a resolution of
                                the Senate with reference to taking up the unfinished business of
                                this session and acting upon it at the next regular session, in the
                                order and at the stage in which it will be left at the adjournment
                                of the special session, and of continuing the organization made at
                                the commencement of the special session, reported that on account of
                                doubts entertained of the constitutionality of the matter, it is
                                unwise and inexpedient to take up the business of this session in
                                the order and at the stage it will be left at the adjournment of the
                                special session, but recommended that the organizaton made at the
                                commencement of the special session be continued.
                            Mr. HEFFREN was opposed to the continuation of the present
                                organization, and moved to strike out all that part of the
                                report.
                            Mr. CONNER and Mr. LINE spoke to this motion, when - 
                            Mr. HEFFREN withdrew it.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON asked for a division of the question.
                            Mr. HAMILTON was oppased to the continuation of the organization.
                            Mr. WALLACE would consent to the continuance of the organization for
                                the simple purpose of getting rid of a strife at the beginning of
                                the next session, because he did not believe the Democrats could
                                control the organization.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER opposed the continuation of the present organization during the
                                regular session.
                            Mr. HEFFREN did not believe the Senate had the power to organize for
                                the regular session of 1859. We have to adjourn sine
                                    die, and that is the last of the Senate of 1858. When the
                                Senate meets on the 6th of January, 1859, it must regularly organize
                                for that session.
                            Mr. MARCH was in favor of organizing on the first day of the regular
                                session and adopting the officiary of this session for the session
                                of 1859.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON said if Republicans had the power to elect their own
                                officers why were they so anxious to forestall action at the regular
                                session; and if Democrats had the power they wanted a chance to
                                exercise it.
                            Mr. JONES presumed that this body had no power to control the regular
                                session. At the meeting of the next session he might vote for a
                                resolution continuing the present organization, but circumstances
                                may transpire which would change his course.
                            Mr. ANTHONY did not think this was a partisan question, but there
                                seemed to be an effort to make it so. He had never before witnessed
                                the same amount of liberality as was manifested by the Republicans
                                in the organization of this session. They had strength enough to
                                prevent any organization that did not suit them. He thought this
                                Legislature did not expire until the end of the next session, and it
                                was a question in his mind whether there was power in the Senate to
                                overthrow the present organization.
                            Mr. CARNAHAN moved to lay the report and motion on the table; but
                                withdrew for - 
                            Mr. WALLACE, who said that his action upon this question was made
                                dependent upon the course pursued by the Senator from Bartholomew
                                [Mr. Jones], and as that gentleman had signified his intention of
                                voting against the report of the committee, he would act with the
                                Democracy as long as there was a shadow of a chance for their
                                success. He reviewed the motion of the Senator from Posey [Mr.
                                Carnahan].
                            The yeas and nays were demanded by Messrs. March and Hill, and being
                                ordered and taken, resulted - yeas 24, nays 23, as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS. - Messrs. Carnahan, Cobb, Conley, Fisk, Hamilton,
                                            Hargrove, Heffren, Jennings, Johnston, Jones, Line,
                                            Lomax, McClure, Miller, O'Brien, Odell, Robinson,
                                            Shoemaker, Slack, Studabaker, Tarkington, Wallace,
                                            Williams and Wilson - 24.
                                        NAYS. - Messrs. Anthony, Beeson, Blair,Bobbs, Brown,
                                            Conner, Cravens, Craven, Culver, Gooding, Green, Hendry,
                                            Hill, Kinley, March, Murray, Rice, Steele, Stevens,
                                            Thompson, Turner, Wagner and Weir - 23.
                                    
                                
                            
                            So the report lies on the table.
                            Mr. McLEAN, when his name was called, said that having previously
                                paired off with the Senator from Rush [Mr. Cooper], on all political
                                questions he would not vote. In further explanation, he remarked
                                that the report of the Judiciary Committee in
                                opposition to the constitutional right and power of the regular
                                session to take up, at the point left off, the business of this
                                extra session, met his approval; but he was opposed, at this time,
                                to the passage of any resolution which would forestall the
                                organization of the next session. He did not think the next Senate
                                would be bound by any such a resolution.
                        
                        
                            SHERIFF'S FEES.
                            Mr. SLACK, from the same committee, to which was referred Mr.
                                Steven's bill (S. 66) to secure advance fees to Sheriffs, reported
                                the same back, recommending its indefinite postponement.
                            On motion of Mr. MARCH, the report was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            COSTS IN CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS.
                            Mr. GOODING, from the same committee, to which was referred a
                                resolution of the Senate, inquiring into the expediency of making
                                the State pay the expenses of witnesses and officers in criminal
                                causes, reported the same back with the expression of opinion, that
                                further legislation on that subject was inexpedient.
                            The report was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            SCHOOL LANDS.
                            Mr. CRAVENS, from the Committee on Education, to
                                which was referred the bill (H. R.
                                    22) for the reappraisement of unsold school lands in this
                                State, returned the same back with an amendment, and recommended its
                                passage.
                            The report was concurred in, the bill read the second time by title,
                                and ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                        
                        
                            ROAD TAX.
                            Mr. BLAIR, from the Committee on County and Township
                                    Business, to which was referred a resolution of the
                                Senate, requesting them to "inquire whether there is any law in
                                force for the collection of road taxes, and if not, whether any
                                legislation on the subject is expedient," reported that by the
                                second and fourth sections of chapter forty-three of the acts of
                                1855, the township trustees may levy such tax, and that the same may
                                be collected as other township taxes, as provided in the 1st volume
                                of the Revised Statutes of 1852, page 496 and section 15.
                            [A message from the Governor, announced that his Excellency had
                                approved and signed Mr. Heffren's bill (S. 11) An act in relation to
                                ventilating, repairing and warming county prisons.
                        
                        
                            THE SABBATH DAY.
                            Mr. GOODING, from the Committee on Temperance, to
                                which was referred Mr. Green's bill (S. 33) entitled a bill for the
                                protection of the Sabbath, with penalties for the violation thereof;
                                and to repeal an act entitled an Act for the protection of the
                                Sabbath, and providing penalties for the desecration thereof,
                                approved February 28th, 1855, reported the same back to the Senate,
                                and recommended that the same be laid on the table and that the
                                accompanying bill (No. 105) be a substitute in lieu thereof, and the
                                committee recommended that the same do pass.
                            The report was concurred in.
                            Mr. Gooding's bill (S. 105) an act to repeal section 2 of an act for
                                the protection of the Sabbath, and providing penalties for the
                                desecration thereof, approved February 28, 1855, was passed the
                                first reading.
                        
                        
                            LAWFUL ASSEMBLAGES.
                            Mr. HEFFREN, from the select committee, to which was referred Mr.
                                Wagner's bill (S. 74) for the better protection of churches, public
                                meetings, agricultural fairs and other lawful assemblages  reported the same back with an
                                amendment, inserting appropriately these words:
                            "Or any person who may be the owner or proprietor of any real
                                property, who may rent the same to be occupied for any such
                                purpose."
                            And when so amended the committee recommended the passage of the
                                bill.
                            The report was concurred in, and the bill was ordered to be
                                engrossed.

                            Mr. MILLER offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That inasmuch as it is in
                                            contemplation to adjourn next week, no Senator shall be
                                            entitled to speak more than ten minutes to any one
                                            question, without the unanimous consent of the
                                            Senate.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. WEIR moved as an amendment "that no new business shall be
                                introduced during the present session."
                            Mr. MILLER accepted the amendment.
                            Mr. GOODING suggested that no further business be done at all. He
                                looked upon it as child's play to say how many minutes a man may
                                speak upon any subject or at any time.
                            The PRESIDENT pro tem, decided that the resolution
                                was not in order without one day's notice.
                            Mr. MILLER withdrew his resolution.
                            Mr. HEFFREN offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                                Committee be requested to return to the
                                            Senate, Senate bill No. 50, on regulating changes of
                                            venue.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. GOODING. I have the bill and am making out the report. It will be
                                returned this afternoon if the Senate will receive it.
                            Mr. HEFFREN withdrew his resolution.

                            Mr. TURNER offered the following, which was adopted:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved. That the Committee
                                                on the Benevolent Institutions be
                                            instructed to inquire into the expediency of reducing

                                            providing that the same Board have control of all said

                            COUNTY TREASURERS.
                            Mr. STEELE offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee
                                                on County and Township Business inquire
                                            into and report to the Senate whether the law of 1855,
                                            in regard to the fees of county treasurers, needs any
                                            amendment so that the law may be construed uniformly
                                            throughout the State.

                                            Constitution, against, and in defiance of the well known

                                            of that Territory, was at the time and still is
                                            disapproved by the people of this State.

                                                Committee on Territories is most
                                            heartly and fully disapproved and repudiated by the
                                            people of this State.
                                        Be it further resolved, That his

                                resolutions, like a bill, through three times.
                            The PRESIDENT, pro tem, said it has been customary

                            ALLEN MAY,
                            Mr. WEIR offered the following: 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                                Committee be instructed to return to the
                                            Senate, for its action, Joint Resolution (No. 4) in regard
                                            to the claim in favor of the State against Allen May and
                                            others.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MARCH. I would like to inquire the reason for the adoption of
                                this resolution.
                            Mr. WEIR. The reason is that we ought to have that joint resolution
                                disposed of in some manner. This claim has been running for some two
                                or three years, and nothing has been done with it.
                            Mr. MARCH. The committee is as anxious as the Senator from Laporte to
                                have the matter settled. The committee have served process for
                                witnesses and they will probably be through with the examination
                                to-day. As soon as they can, the committee will report.
                            Mr. WEIR withdrew his resolution.
                        
                        
                            THE KANSAS QUESTION.
                            Mr. JONES offered the following Joint Resolution (No. 7):
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS, It is at this time eminently fit and proper that
                                            a frank expression of opinion on the only living
                                            political issue of the day should be made by the
                                            Senators and Representatives of the State of Indiana, in
                                            the Legislature; therefore - 
                                        Be it Resolved, &c., That Robert J.
                                            Walker, late Governor of Kansas, in his efforts to
                                            effect a fair settlement of the Kansas difficulties,
                                            proved himself worthy of his high position; and the
                                            failure of the President to sustain him has merited and
                                            received the condemnation of the people of Indiana.
                                        Resolved, That the attempt made by the
                                            President and Congress to force the Lecompton
                                            Constitution upon the people of Kansas against their
                                            expressed will, is regarded by the people of Indiana, as
                                            a direct attack on the right of the people to govern
                                            themselves.
                                        Resolved, That the doctrine enunciated
                                            by Jesse D. Blight, in the Senate of the United States,
                                            that "the principle of submitting constitutions to a
                                            direct vote of the people a vicious principle," is an
                                            anti-Democratic and vicious doctrine, and that Jesse D.
                                            Bright and Graham N. Fitch, in promulgating that and
                                            similar doctrines, stand opposed to the known sentiments
                                            of the people of Indiana.
                                        Resolved, That Stephen A. Douglas, by
                                            his manly and able defense of the doctrine "that all
                                            governments derive their just powers from the consent of
                                            the governed," has deserved and received the approbation
                                            of the people of Indiana.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. WALLACE moved that the order of business be suspended and the
                                joint resolution be read a second time, now.
                            The yeas and nays being demanded - 
                            Mr. WALLACE said if it would take up so much time, he would withdraw
                                his motion.

                            The yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken,

                                            Hargrove. Heffren, Jennings, Johaston, Kialey, Line,
                                            Lomax, Miller, O'Brien, Odell, Shoemaker, Studabaker,
                                            Tarkington and Williams - 18.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. ANTHONY, when his name was called, said, he did not wish to
                                commit himself by his vote to the first or the last resolution.
                            Mr. BOBBS, when his name was called, said, to accommodate gentlemen
                                who desire to have this vote, I vote "aye."
                            Mr. COBB, when his name was called, said, I voted some time ago to
                                lay resolutions of a political character on the table, because I did
                                not desire at that time that resolutions of that character should
                                come up - I thought them premeditory - although some of them agreed
                                with my principles. But the time has now come when I want to place
                                myself upon the records of this Senate, and I want every other
                                member of the Democratic party to place his vote upon the record
                                also, so that; it may be understood by the people of the State.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, when his name was called, said, I have been opposed to
                                the introduction of political questions here, from the first to the
                                last. This resolution would have me not only to indorse Mr. Douglas,
                                but to condemn Messrs. Bright and Fitch, while I am not prepared to
                                do one thing or the other Perhaps I am as much of an Anti Lecompton
                                man as the Senator who introduced the resolution, but I will vote
                                no, notwithstanding.
                            Mr. HEFFREN, when his name was called, said, I hive no objection to
                                facing the music when this resolution comes up; but I am opposed to
                                the consideration of such resolutions when the session is so near
                                closed.
                            Mr. HENDRY,when his name was called, said: I want to vote "aye" to
                                accommodate Senators, although the resolutions as they are don't
                                suit me.
                            Mr. HILL, when his name was called, said: I don't like the
                                resolutions, but I shall vote "aye."
                            Mr. JOHNSTON, when his name was called, said: Tuere has been some
                                insinuation thrown out here that some Senators were afraid to vote.
                                As far as that is intended to apply to me, I will have honerable
                                Senators to know that as far as putting my name on record is
                                concerned, I stand as independent and as little afraid as any
                                Senator upon this floor. I am not one of those pinning their faith
                                to any body's sleeve, or that can be led by the nose into this thing
                                or that. I have my own opinions, and those opinions I will express
                                when the proper time comes; but I am not in such a great hurry to
                                put my name on the record, for I don't think it matters much to the
                                people whether it goes there or not. My constituents know my
                                position, and if necessary I would have it put in large letters and
                                placed upon my back, so that everybody might know that I am
                                Anti-Lecompton. I will not follow Mr. Buchanm wherever he may choose
                                to go, and I will not follow Mr. Douglas wherever he may go, nor am
                                I willing to vote for every resolution that the Senator from Hancock
                                [Mr. Gooding] gets up, for I do not mean to follow him wherever he
                                goes. But I do not think we ought to take up political questions
                                this session - the people don't look for this time to be taken up
                                with resolutions condemning anybody, and therefore I vote "no."
                            Mr. KINLEY, when his name was called, said: He had paired off with
                                the Senator from Scott [Mr. McClure] but would take the
                                responsibility of voting. I have voted uniformly against taking up
                                the time of the Senate with po litical questions, and acting upon
                                that principle shall vote "no" now.
                            Mr. MILLER, when his name was called, said: I will state that if this
                                Lecompton matter was a living issue, I would unhesitatingly say I am
                                an Anti-Lecompton man, but I am willing to say that I shall not vote
                                to indorse or condemn anybody. I recollect that the champion, Henry
                                Clay, voted against the instructions of the Legislature of Kentucky,
                                when he voted for the bankrupt law; and I shall not vote to condemn
                                Messrs. Bright and Fitch in any matter where I do not think their
                                action has been influenced by private considerations
                            Mr. GOODING, [interrupting.] Do I understand the Senator to say that
                                the President [Mr. Buchanan] talks in his message about dead
                                issues?
                            Mr. MILLER. I don't know but that the President could be better
                                employed in talking about other things in his message than Kansas.
                                [Laughter.]
                            Mr. MURRAY, when his name was called, said: This was the first
                                political question that he had ever enjoyed the pleasure of being
                                able to vote with the Democratic party. With a little modification
                                of one of the resolutions, he could vote freely for all of them.
                            Mr. WALLACE, when his name was called, said: Mr. President, I shall
                                never put myself on record against my own honest sentiments. I vote
                                "aye."
                            Mr. WEIR, when his name was called, said: I presume, although I shall
                                vote for a suspension of the rules, I shan't vote for the
                                resolutions is they are. I should like to see a fair flop between
                                the wings and the body of this Lecompton bird, therefore I vote
                                "aye."So, two-thirds not voting in the affirmative
                            The rules were not suspended.
                        
                        
                            SWAMP LANDS.
                            The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before the Senate a
                                communication from the Secretary of State in reply to a resolution
                                of the Senate that; the Secretary of State be requested to
                                communicate to the Senate, at his earliest convenience, the amount
                                of swamp lands deeded to each individual since the last session of
                                the Legislature, in what county the same is situated, and the amount
                                of money paid for the same (if he has a record of the amount of
                                payment in his office); also, how much of said lands have been
                                ditched and drained; in which the Secretary stated that the only way
                                by which the information asked for in the first part of the
                                resolution could be obtained would be by referring to each patent
                                issued, and that service could not be performed by the force now
                                employed in his office. The other inquiries could be better obtained
                                from the Auditor's office.
                            Mr. GREEN moved that the communication be referred to the
                                    Swamp Land Committee.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                        
                            COST OF PRINTING THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF
                                STATE.
                            The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before the Senate
                                another communication from the Secretary of State in answer to a
                                resolution asking him to inform the Senate by what authority his
                                predecessor had printed in his report certain statistical matter,
                                nnd the cost of printing thereof; in which he states that he knows
                                of no authority other than that stated in the commencement of said
                                report; and as to the cost of printing the same, he apprehended the
                                information desired could be more properly obtained elsewhere.
                            On motion by Mr. RICE, the communication was referred to the
                                    Committee on Printing.
                            Mr. HEFFREN said that for the information of Senators desiring to
                                know about the cost of printing the matter referred to, he would
                                state the amount to be about $276.
                        
                        
                            LEGAL ADVERTISEMENTS.
                            Mr. BOBBS, from the select committee to which was referred Mr.
                                Green's bill (S. 41) in relation to the publication of legal
                                advertisements, reported the same back with the following amendments
                                thereto, and when so amended recommend its passage:
                            Amend the 1st section by striking out "weekly newspapers," and
                                inserting in lieu thereof "a weekly newspaper," and amend the same
                                section by striking out the words "daily newspapers," and inserting
                                "a daily newspaper," where they respectively occur.
                            Mr. GOODING said the proposition was to so change the law as that the
                                advertisement may be printed once a week in a daily paper. He was
                                opposed to it, because it was in effect a bill to give notice to
                                towns and cities and not to the country.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS proposed to amend the report by striking out the words
                                "daily newspapers" wherever they occur.
                            Mr. RICE was opposed to the amendment He thought it right to give
                                discretion to the officer to publish in a daily paper if he thought
                                best.
                            Mr. MARCH demanded a division of the question.
                            The question being upon the amendment of the Senator from Knox [Mr.
                                Williams] it was agreed to by yeas 23, nays 11.
                            On motion by Mr. MARCH, the report as amended was laid on the
                                table.
                        
                        
                            CHOOSING UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            Mr. WALLACE obtained leave to make a report from the select
                                committee, to whom was referred his bill (S. 91) regulating the
                                choosing of United States Senators,and providing for the designation
                                of such. Senators by the voters of the State. The report proposed
                                amendments and recommended the passage of the bill.
                            The report was concurred in, the bill read the second time by its
                                title, and ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TILL MONDAY.
                            Mr. JENNINGS obtained leave to offer the following: 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That when the Senate adjourn,
                                            it adjourn till Monday, 2 o'clock, P. M.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. HEFFREN stated that the House of Representatives had adjourned
                                till Monday, 2 o'clock, and he did not think that we ought to be
                                compelled to work more than they of the House.
                            Mr HAMILTON thought we had better meet this afternoon and get up a
                                political discussion.
                            Mr. GREEN hoped the Senate would adjourn, because there were enough
                                Senators paired off and absent to defeat any astion that might be
                                had.
                            The resolution was rejected by - yeas 12, nays 32.
                        
                        
                            JUDGMENT SALES OF PROPERTY.
                            The PRESIDENT pro tempore, announced the special
                                order - being a report from the Judiciary
                                    Committee upon Mr. Murray's bill, (S. 57) providing
                                that no judgment shall be rendered authorizing the sale of property,
                                waiving benefit of valuation and apnraisement laws.
                            Mr. MURRAY said, in order to save discussion, and as Senators say
                                there are other things in the law proposed to be amended that ought
                                to be reached by this bill; he moved that the bill be recommitted to
                                the Judiciary Committee.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            RE-LOCATION OF COUNTY SEATS.
                            Mr. MARCH moved to take from the table messages from the House of
                                Representatives.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            The bill (H. R. 79) for the
                                re-location of county seats, was read through the first time.
                            Mr. SHOEMAKER moved a suspension of the rules, and that the bill be
                                read the second time now.
                            The motion was agreed to - yeas 37, nays 3 - and the bill was read
                                the second time by title.
                            Mr. COBB moved to amend by adding the following:
                            This act shall not be taken as repealing an act providing for the
                                re-location of county seats, approved March 2, 1855.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON moved to amend by striking out the word "lawyers"
                                wherever it occurs in the bill, and inserting in lieu thereof the
                                words "competent persons." [Laughter.]
                            On motion by Mr. HEFFREN the bill and amendments were referred to a
                                select committee of three.
                            The PRESIDENT, pro tempore, appointed Messrs.
                                Shoemaker, Cobb and Wilson, said committee.
                        
                        
                            BOARD OF ELECTIONS.
                            The bill (H. R. 62) for the
                                punishment of officers of elections for refusing or neglecting to
                                receive legal votes, was read through and passed the first
                                reading.
                            The resolution from the House of Representatives, requesting the
                                Senate to return to the House Mr. Jones' bill (S. 31) fixing the time of
                                holding courts in Bartholomew county, being read - 
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved that the resolution lie on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.
                            The following resolution from the House of Representatives, came up
                                as the next thing for the consideration of the Senate:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That this General Assembly
                                            will adjourn sine die on Wednesday,
                                            the 22d inst.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                            Mr HEFFREN moved to amend by inserting "Friday, the 24th."
                            Mr. MARCH said, as the Senate is not full it would be unfair to take
                                final action now. I move that the resolution lie upon the table.
                            Mr. HEFFREN withdrew his amendment.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            PUBLIC OFFICERS AS WITNESSES.
                            Mr. Jones' bill (S. 52) to render public officers competent to act as
                                witnesses in cases brought on their relation to the State; and
                                providing that the defendants to such action shall also be permitted
                                to testify; coming up on the third reading, it was not passed, (yeas
                                23, nays 15) for want of a constitutional majority.
                            And then the Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock, P.M.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. WAGNER obtained unanimous consent to introduce a bill (S. 107) to
                                authorize the Governor, Treasurer and Auditor of State to borrow
                                money from the Sinking Fund Commissioners to pay wholly or in part
                                the interest on the State debt due in January 1859.
                            Mr. HEFFREN stated that arrangements were already made for the
                                borrowing of this money.
                            Mr. WAGNER moved that the rules be suspended and the bill read the
                                second time now.
                            The motion was rejected by yeas 29, nays 3 - two-thirds not voting in
                                the affirmative.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS moved to reconsider the vote by which Mr. Wallace's
                                joint resolution, censuring the action of the Indiana U. S. Senators
                                in the Lecompton question, was postponed to the 28th instant.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. GREEN moved a call of the Senate.
                            The Secretary reported thirty-nine Senators present.
                            On motion of Mr. GREEN, further proceedings in the call were
                                dispensed with.
                            On motion by Mr. CRAVENS a recount was had of the vote on Mr.
                                Wagner's motion to suspend the rules, and the rules were suspended
                                by yeas 37, nays 3.
                            So Mr. Wagner's bill (S. 107) was read by its title the second
                                time.
                            Mr. CRAVENS moved that it be referred to a select committee of
                                five.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            The PRESIDENT, pro tempore, makes this committee to
                                consist of Messrs. Cravens, Gooding, Carnahan, Murray and
                                Miller.

                            
                                COUNTY BOUNDARIES.
                                The bill (H. R. 11) repealing section 2 of an act forming new
                                    counties and changing county ooundaries, approved March 7, 1857,
                                    coming up on the second reading - 
                                Mr. MURRAY moved its reference to the Judiciary
                                        Committee.
                                Mr. WAGNER moved to amend Mr. Murray's motion by striking out
                                        "Judiciary Committee" and inserting "a
                                    select committee of five."
                                The motion was agreed to, and the bill was referred to a select
                                    committee of five, which the PRESIDENT, pro
                                        tempore makes to consist of Messrs. Wagner, Murray,
                                    Odell, Heffren and Rice.
                            
                            
                                SPECIAL TERMS OF COURTS.
                                The bill (H. R. 36) to amend section 1 of an act providing for
                                    extending the terms of courts by adjournments, &c., approved
                                    February 12, 1855, and to authorize judges to call and hold
                                    special terms, and for pay to judges and prosecuting attorneys
                                    in attendance upon the same, coming up on the second reading - 
                                Mr. HEFFREN moved its reference to the Judiciary
                                        Committee and it was so referred.
                            
                            
                                PARTITION OF REAL ESTATE.
                                Mr. Conner's bill (S. 97) to provide for the partition of real
                                    estate, laying the same off into lots, streets and alleys,
                                    coming up, it was read through the second time and ordered to be
                                    engrossed for the third reading.
                            
                            
                                PAPER CURRENCY.
                                By unanimous consent the bill (H. R. 9) to prevent the
                                    circulation of unauthorized paper currency was read through and
                                    passed the first reading.
                            
                            
                                DJOURNING TILL MONDAY.
                                
                                Mr. BOYD, (by unanimous consent,) submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That this House now
                                                recede from the resolution by which it was ordered
                                                that the House shall adjourn each Saturday at eleven
                                                o'clock till Monday at two o'clock.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. SCOTT. The House has already once refused to reconsider the
                                    vote on the adoption of that resolution.
                                The SPEAKER. It is out of order, for the time (eleven o'clock) is
                                    already past. This House stands adjourned till Monday 2
                                    o'clock.
                                So the House adjourned.
                                Stanfield paired off with Merrifield.
                                So the intructions prevailed.
                                Mr. EDWARDS moved to reconsider this ator from Warren [Mr.
                                    Wagner] to the chair; but he, pleading that he wished to be upon
                                    the floor during the discussion, designated the Senator from
                                    Jefferson [Mr. Cravens].
                                The Senate accordingly resolved itself into a Committee of the
                                    Whole - Mr. Cravens in the chair.
                                Messrs. Heffren, Johnston, Murray, Wagner, Craven, Stevens,
                                    Kinley, Beeson and Line were severally heard at length upon the
                                    merits and demerits of the bill, when - 
                                Mr. WAGNER moved that the bill be reported to the Senate, the
                                    committee rise, report progress, and ask to be discharged from
                                    the further consideration thereof.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                So, Mr. CRAVENS, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, to
                                    whom was referred Mr. Wagner's bill (S.26) supplemental to an
                                    act providing for a general system of common schools, reported
                                    that the committee had had the same under consideration, and
                                    after protracted discussion thereon, had directed him to report
                                    the bill back to the Senate, without amendment, asking to be
                                    discharged from the further consideration thereof.
                                The report was concurred in by consent.

                                Mr. MARCH, from the Judiciary Committee,  to which was referred a
                                    resolution having reference to the claim of the State against
                                    Allen May and others, obtained unanimous consent to report that
                                    in the opinion of the Committee, Colonel May's sureties, Messrs.
                                    Bright and Drake, had due notice of process, and are liable for
                                    the amount.
                            
                            
                                CHANGE OF VENUE.
                                Mr. GOODING, from the same committee, to which was referred Mr.
                                    Heffren's bill (S. 50) to amend the sections 207 and 208 of a
                                    law reform act, approved June 18, 1852; so as to Authorize a
                                    change of venue in certain cases, obtained leave to report the
                                    same back, recommending its passage with amendments.
                                The report was concurred in, by consent, and the bill ordered to
                                    be engrossed.
                            
                            
                                OLD STATE BANK.
                                Mr. WALLACE moved that the Committee on
                                        Finance be instructed to report back to the Senate
                                    his joint resolution (S. 3) with regard to the in debtedness of
                                    the old State Bank to the State of Indiana.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr. GREEN demanded a call of the Senate.
                                The call having been commenced - 
                                A SENATOR moved that the call be dispensed with.
                                The PRESIDENT pro tempore decided that the
                                    motion was agreed to, and in the midst of cries for "a
                                    division," and many motions to adjourn, he declared - 
                                The Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            SATURDAY, December 18,1858.
                        
                        The reading of the Journal of yesterday was dispensed with.
                        
                            FUND COMMISSIONERS BILL.
                            The special order, viz: the consideration of Mr. Stanfield's
                                amendment to the amendment of the bill (H. R. 98) as follows:
                            That the President and employees of said Board shall receive such
                                salary and compensations as may be allowed by said Board, until
                                their salaries and compensations shall be fixed by law.
                            Mr. STANFIELD said he was indifferent as to the matter - was
                                satisfied with the salaries as they stood in the original amendment.
                                When the Legislature came to consider fees and salaries generally,
                                the matter would be reconsidered and determined again.
                            The amendment to the amendment was concurred in, and the amendment as
                                amended was adopted.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry, submitted the following amendments, as agreed
                                upon by the Committee on Ways and Means, which
                                were severally adopted:
                            Amend by striking out "present" in section 1st, and substituting the
                                words "next regular."
                            Amend section 11, by striking out the words "hereinafter designated,"
                                in the seventh line, and inserting in lieu thereof the words "and
                                for all other sums and funds which he is or may be required by law
                                to disburse.
                            Add the following sections, the committee had submitted these, (said
                                Mr. Smith,) to make the security of the fund still stronger and
                                undoubted:
                            SECTION 13. That said Sinking Fund shall not have any lien upon the
                                funds described in section 2 of article 8 of the Constitution for
                                any advancements made and to be made by said Sinking Fund to the
                                State, but said funds shall be kept separate and distinct from the
                                funds belonging to said Sinking Fund and the revenues of the State
                                proper, and shall be paid out on the check of said Treasurer, at the
                                times and in the manner and for the purposes now provided by law,
                                and not otherwise.
                            SEC. 14. That the Sinking Fund shall have alien upon the funds
                                belonging to the State proper, and which may be deposited by virtue
                                of this act, for the advancements already made and to be made by
                                said fund to the State; and the said Sinking Fund shall not be
                                required to payout the funds herein named, other than trust funds,
                                until the said Sinking Fund shall be reimbursed for the sums of
                                money advanced to the State.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved to recommit the bill with the following
                                instructions:
                            "To provide for funding and repaying to the Sinking Fund (principal
                                and interest) the amount now due said fund from the State."
                            Mr. MURRAY confessed that the bill was far more unobjectionable than
                                at first, but it was still the same bill, though, like the old ship
                                Constitution, it had been many times worked over. He considered its
                                principles, which he regarded as radically wrong, and answered
                                arguments in its favor - and first as to the exigency: We had been
                                told by the gentleman from Perry that already a loan had been
                                negotiated for the January interest; and this was a full answer to
                                the plea of emergency. He then considered its inexpediency. Was
                                there no other way to effect a loan of the trust funds? Why not
                                introduce a bill simply authorizing the Treasurer to make the loan
                                for the January interest? Then, in regard to the security of the
                                public funds: Was such a scheme necessary? His opinion was that the
                                true policy was to distribute these funds among the several
                                counties, where the law authorized that they should be deposited by
                                loans, or that they should be appropriated toward buyiug in the
                                State bonds. Such a policy would be a means of increasing the
                                taxable property of the State - so putting into the Treasury a kind
                                of double interest. He also looked to the consequences of such a
                                radical change in the management of the State finances. It was a
                                scheme untried and unnecessary. The Treasurer could be restricted
                                better and easier than those five members of the Board. As a mere
                                party question he accepted it, but denied that it could have any
                                desirable political effect. This bill was fraught with consequences
                                full of important results - and he said this in view of the
                                Governor's stump speech declaration, that the Republican party never
                                could do any public good. He washed his hands of it. If the
                                Republican State ticket had been elected no such proposition would
                                have been heard of from the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means. Were he a Democrat he would consider it an
                                insult to the man whom he had helped to make Treasurer, fund he was
                                astonished to see the proposition come from a Democrat.
                            The SPEAKER repressed this range of debate, but - 
                            Mr. MURRAY proceeded by permission of the House. The eulogy which the
                                gentleman from Perry pronounced upon the management of this fund,
                                was a most withering commentary upon the financial conduct of the
                                State officers. But this was also an argument against the bill. Who
                                were to fill the places of these Fund Commissioners?  They would not be the same as now.
                                They could not be more honest and incorruptible. Men of all parties
                                were alike liable to corrupt action. Was it good policy to use Trust
                                Funds to meet our liabilities? It was to establish a bad precedent -
                                following the example of the Legislature of 1841. Future
                                Legislatures would follow yet further, and grab the last dollar of
                                this Common School Fund, established for the children of the State
                                by the beneficent fathers of the State. He was aware of the latent
                                opposition to the school system. Not having himself the advantages
                                of an early education, he could doubly appreciate the value of this
                                fund. He depended upon the common school as the only resource for
                                the education of his children. Out of these common schools went
                                forth a larger number of those into whose hands the destinies of
                                this country were to be committed, and who would worthily control
                                them, than walked forth from your college halls. He had proposed to
                                recommit the bill with instructions to provide for the repayment -
                                principal and interest, of the amount now due to this fund. He was
                                regarded at home as a Young America - a radical; but gentlemen were
                                so far outwent him, that he would have to tell his people, that he
                                was no more a radical, but henceforth a conservative of the
                                strictest sect. He affirmed that under the present assessment, the
                                delinquent list next year, instead of $50,000, would be $100,000. He
                                had no more reliance on the estimates of the Committee on
                                    Ways and Means, than he could have on their power to
                                control the winds of heaven, &c.
                            Mr. BLACK opposed the bill, from the consideration, that it was an
                                untried system. The present custody of the fund had been safe and
                                satisfactory He would let well enough alone. The people would not
                                pay a large increase of taxes. How do gentlemen promise to pay, when
                                they have nothing to pay with, &c.
                            [A message from the Governor announced that he had approved and
                                signed the bill (S. 11) to
                                provide for warming county prisons.]

                                yesterday, and defended and supported the bill by various

                            Mr. WEIR moved to amend the amendment by striking out from the bill
                                "$2,000" and inserting in lieu thereof "$2,500," and striking out
                                "$1,500" and inserting "$2,000," and insisted upon its adoption,
                                various considerations submitted at length.
                            Mr. MARCH recommended the adoption of the amendment offered by him.
                                If the salaries were increased, office seekers would be stumping for
                                the places out of mere: nary motives. He had heard of no judge
                                wanting bread or going naked under the present salary, and he was
                                opposed to larger figures than he had proposed.
                            Mr. MURRAY thought the Circuit Judges' salary should be larger than
                                that of the Supreme Judge, if any discrimination is made in the
                                amount of compensation allowed. He thought the salaries ought to be
                                increased, but to what amount he was not prepared to say.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER desired a change in the salaries of Judicial officers,
                                and especially in that of Prosecuting Attorneys. Young men just
                                entering upon the profession, have been placed in these positions;
                                they can not compete with the experience and talent of the bar, and
                                in many cases the Judges are compelled to employ an assistant to the
                                Prosecutor at the expense of the State, in order to secure a just
                                prosecution in criminal cases. The young lawyer can not successfully
                                prosecute a case in opposition to one or two lawyers of twenty
                                year's experience. He wanted the salary raised so that competent men
                                would accept these positions. It would be more economical in the
                                long run.
                            Mr. WEIR withdrew his amendment.
                            Mr. WAGNER offered an amendment to increase the fees of Justices of
                                the Peace one hundred per cent. He objected to singling out the
                                officers named in the bill, and increase their salaries. He would
                                vote to increasing no salaries until the fees of public officers
                                were examined, and a sort of equalization of salaries could be
                                adopted. He was prepared to show that the Governor, who claims to
                                get a salary of $1,500, gets $4,000, and that according to law, or
                                rather, in the absence of law. The incompetency of Justice's of the
                                Peace costs more by appeals from their decisions than any other
                                branch of the Judiciary in the State.
                            Mr. COBB thought the salaries of the officers named in the bill
                                should be increased, but not to too great an extent. He thought the
                                bill was premature because it was more than probable that the
                                judicial system would be reorganized at the next session of the
                                Legislature, and it would then oe neccessary to make the salaries
                                conform to that organization. He opposed the passage of the bill for
                                this reason.
                            Mr. HAMILTON said that he did not introduce this bill because
                                Democrats were in office, for he would insist just as strongly upon
                                the passage of the bill if Republicans were to be benefitted - in
                                fact there were a good many Republicans holding these offices
                                throughout the State although a majority of office-holders were  Democrats. He moved to lay the
                                amendments on the table.
                            Mr. GREEN demanded a division of the question.
                            The question being upon the motion to lay on the table the amendment
                                of the Senator from Warren [Mr. Wagner] it was agreed to by yeas 33,
                                nays 5.
                            [The Governor returned to the Senate Mr. Hargrove's bill (S. 28) for the election of
                                United States Senators, with his objections thereto in writing, by
                                the hands of Mr. Osborne, his Private Secretary.]
                            The next question being upon the motion to lay on the table the
                                amendment of the Senator from Delaware [Mr. March] it was rejected
                                by yeas 13, nays 25.
                            Mr. MURRAY offered to amend the amendment by making the salaries of
                                Supreme and Circuit Judges $1,500 and Prosecuting Attorneys
                                $600.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON moved to lay the bill and pending amendments on the
                                table.
                            Mr. HENDRY demanded a division of the question.
                            The question being upon laying the amendment on the table.
                            It was laid on the table by yeas 27, nays 11.
                            The question recurring on laying the bill and pending amendment on
                                the table.
                            The yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken,
                                resulted - yeas 19, nays 19 - as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS - Messrs Bobbs, Brown, Carnahan, Cobb, Conley, Eisk,
                                            Hentiry, Johnston, Line, Lomax, Murray, Rice, Robinson,
                                            Tarkington, Thompson, Turner, Wagner, Wallace and Wilson
                                            - 19.
                                        NAYS - Messrs. Beeson, Blair, Cravens, Gooding, Green,
                                            Hamilton, Heffren, Hill, Kinley, McLean, March, Miller,
                                            O'Brien Odell, Shoemaker, Steele, Studabaker, Weir and
                                            Williams - 19.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BOBBS, when his name was called, said: I would like the bill to
                                comprehend more than the officers named, consequently I vote
                                "aye."
                            Mr. BROWN, when his name was called, said: If we raise the salary of
                                one, we ought to raise the salary of all, and a bill should be
                                introduced raising the salaries in proper ratio of all officers,
                                therefore I vote "aye."
                            Mr. RICE, when his name was called, said: I am in favor, at the
                                proper time, of raising the salary of all judicial officers, but
                                while we are contemplating the revision of our entire judicial
                                system, I think it would be premature, at this time, to fix or
                                increase any salaries. With the design, at the proper time, to vote
                                for an increase of salaries, on this question I vote to lay the bill
                                and amendment on the table.
                            Mr. WALLACE, when his name was called, spoke at considerable length,
                                in which he advocated raising of the salary of every judicial
                                officer; but he thought those proposed in the bill were not enough,
                                consequently he voted "aye."
                            The PRESIDENT. The bill lies on the table. I give my vote believing
                                that, at the present session, it would be inopportune to mature the
                                bill.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON moved to take up the message from the Governor.
                            Mr. MARCH hoped the Senator would withdraw his motion, because the
                                Senate is not full, and every Senator would like to be in his seat
                                when the message comes up.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON withdrew his motion.
                        
                        
                            PAPER CURRENCY.
                            The bill (H. R. 9) to prevent the circulation of unauthorized paper
                                currency, and for the redemption of such as has heretofore been
                                issued, coming up on the second reading - 
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved that the bill be referred to a select committee of
                                five, with any amendments that may be offered.
                            Mr. MARCH offered the following amendment:
                            Section - Be it further enacted, That any person
                                who shall, knowingly, exchange, barter, sell, or put away for a
                                valuable consideration, any bank note or bill, drawn on or by any
                                bank of any State, knowing such bank at the time to have suspended
                                special payments or to be broken, without disclosing such knowledge
                                to the person receiving such bill or note, shall be deemed guilty of
                                a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof, shall be fined in any sum
                                not less than ten nor over one thousand dollars.
                            Mr. WEIR offered an amendment, making it a misdemeanor punishable by
                                fine and imprison ment in the county jail for the officers of any
                                bank, including President, Cashier and Directors, to fail or refuse,
                                to redeem their bank notes on demand, or to fail to pay deposits on
                                demand received by them from any person or persons, as such bank,
                                and providing the same punishment for brokers or private bankers who
                                fail or refuse to pay deposits received by them from any person or
                                persons; also providing the same penalities for the officers of any
                                bank which has heretofore received deposits, to fail after sixty
                                days after demand to pay over such deposits.
                            Mr. Heffren's motion was now agreed to, and the PRESIDENT makes the
                                committee to consist of Messrs. Heffren, Tarkington, Jones, Kinley
                                and Culver.
                        
                        
                            INCORPORATION OF CITIES.
                            Mr. Anthony's bill (S. 114) to amend the 18th section of an act to
                                repeal all general laws now in force for the incorporation of
                                cities, and pro viding for the incorporation of cities, &c.,
                                approved March 9, 1857, coming up on the second reading - 
                            [This bill simply gives the power to take a change of venue from the
                                Mayor to any Justice of the Peace in the township.]
                            Mr. CRAVENS moved to lay the bill on the table, as the author was not
                                in his seat.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            THE SABBATH DAY.
                            Mr. Gooding's bill (S. 106) to repeal section 2 of an act for the
                                protection of the Sabbath, approved February 28, 1855, coming up on
                                the second reading - 
                            Mr. GREEN moved its reference to a select committee of five.
                            Mr. GOODING said if this bill passed he would leave the law of 1855
                                in force, except that original jurisdiction will betaken from the
                                Common Pleas Court and given to Justices of the Peace.
                            Mr. HEFFREN proposed to amend by repealing section 1, as well as
                                section 2, of the act of February 28, 1855.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved to lay this amendment on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to by yeas 38, nays 1.
                            Mr. Green's motion was then agreed to, and  the PRESIDENT makes the committee to
                                consist of Messrs. Green, Thompson, Hill, Line and Lomax.
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved to instruct the committee so as to protect those
                                who keep the seventh day as well as those who keep the Sabbath.
                            And then the Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            The question being upon the instructions to the select committee,
                                proposed by the Senator from Washington, [Mr. Heffren,] just
                                previous to the recess - 
                            Mr. HEFFREN insisted upon the adoption of his instructions.
                            Mr. GREEN thought the object of the instructions was to kill his
                                bill, whereupon he launched out into an argument in favor of it.
                                When he had concluded - 
                            The instructions were rejected:
                            Mr. WALLACE moved to take from the table the Governor's Message.
                            Mr. MURRAY demanded a call of the Senate.
                            The call was proceeded with when forty-eight Senators were reported
                                as present.
                            [Mr. WAGNER asked and obtained leave of absence for the Senator from
                                Madison, Mr. Craven, who was called home by sickness in his
                                family.]
                            Mr. WALLACE'S motion was lost upon a division of the Senate, by yeas
                                22, nays 24.

                            
                                INTEREST ON THE STATE DEBT.
                                Mr. CRAVENS, by unanimous consent, submitted a report from the
                                    select committee, to which was referred Mr. Wagner's bill (S.
                                    107) authorizing the Governor, Treasurer and Auditor of State to
                                    borrow from the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners, money to
                                    pay wholly or in part the interest due on the State debt in
                                    January 1859, recommending its passage for the following
                                
                                    The existence of doubts as to the power of the
                                        present executive officers of State to negotiate a loan for
                                        the purposes contemplated in the Constitution.
                                    The immediate necessity of providing the means
                                        for meeting and liquidating the interest on the foreign debt
                                        of tbe State, maturing on the 1st day of January, 1859,
                                        and
                                    The propriety of domesticating, so far as
                                        practicable, the public debt, and especially so much thereof
                                        as may be necessarily incurred in providing for the accruing
                                        interest of said debt.As to the first of the above
                                        enumerated reasons, it is sufficient, if a reaonable doubt
                                        exists as to the power, for immediate action on the part of
                                        the General Assembly; for, if deemed advisable on the part
                                        of the officers of State, upon whom is devolved the duty of
                                        providing for the protection of the public credit and honor,
                                        to offer her securities in the money markets of the country,
                                        it is essential that every facility which wise and prudent
                                        legislation can supply should at once and without
                                        unreasonable delay to afforded.In anticipation of the
                                        unavoidable delay incident to the hasty enactment of
                                        measures and interrupting consequent upon the preparation of
                                        the necessary forms of the security, as well as unforeseen
                                        contingencies that might render it impossible for the
                                        officers of State to provide in time for the payment of the
                                        semi-annual instalment of interest maturing on the 1st of
                                        January next, your committee has sought and obtained the
                                        information that the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners can
                                        command the amount now demanded to protect the honor of the
                                        State, and will provide for the loan if required by law so
                                        to do.
                                
                                The report was concurred in, and the bill read by title the
                                    second time.
                                Mr. CRAVENS moved that the bill be considered as engrossed and
                                    read the third time now.
                                Mr. STUDABAKER objected.
                                Mr. CRAVENS urged the passage of the bill in a ten minutes'
                                    speech.
                                [A message from the House of Representatives here announced to
                                    the Senate that the House had concurred in the report of the
                                    free conference committee, on Mr. Tarkington's bill (S. 3) for the
                                    re-appraisement of real estate.]
                                Mr. MURRAY could not see any valid objections to the uassage of
                                    the bill.
                                Mr. Cravens' motion was agreed to and the bill was read through
                                    the third time.
                                The question being, Shall the bill pass?
                                Mr. HEFFREN could not consent to the passage of the bill without
                                    entering his protest against it.
                                Mr. WAGNER advocated the passage of his bill.
                                Mr. BOBBS sustained the provisions of the bill in a few remarks,
                                    during which he took occasion to reflect rather severely upon
                                    the officers of State - charging upon them that they did not
                                    reply in a satisfactory manner to inquiries from either end of
                                    the Capitol, and doubting whether they kept their affairs in
                                    such a manner as that they could do so.
                                Mr. TARKINGTON was in favor of the passage of the bill.
                                Mr. ANTHONY urged the passage of this law immediately.
                                Mr. HEFFREN moved to recommit with instructions to strike out the
                                    words, "Commissioners of the Sinking Fund," and also that they
                                    specifically provide for the repayment of the loan.
                                Mr. WEIR moved to lay the motion on the table.
                                The motion was agreed to by yeas 37, nays 11.
                                The yeas and nays were demanded on the final passage of the bill,

                                Mr. CARNAHAN, when his name was called, said he had some
                                    unwillingness to vote for this bill although he felt himself
                                    bound to do so.
                                Mr. MARCH, when his name was called, said he voted for this bill
                                    as the best measure yet proposed, but he should feel himself
                                    bound to have this money restored - every dime of it - and all
                                    the money heretofore taken from it; and have the fund preserved
                                    for the benefit of common schools.
                                Mr. ROBINSON, when his name was called, said, he had thought he
                                    never would vote to authorize the State officers to borrow an
                                    indefinite amount of money, but it seemed as though we can not
                                    come into possession of the true and definite amount in our
                                    treasury; and he would have to vote for this bill.
                                
                                Mr. WALLACE when his name was called, said, he was in favor in
                                    the first place of an assessment of taxes to meet this interest
                                    on the State debt; but he was not here at the time the vote was
                                    taken on that question. He did not know what he was voting for,
                                    and therefore he voted "no."
                                So the bill passed the Senate.
                                The title was then read and adopted.

                                Mr. Slack's bill (S. 105) to provide for the infliction of
                                    punishment when more than one conviction has been had against
                                    one person, coming up on the second reading - 
                                Mr. HEFFREN moved its reference to the Judiciary
                                        Committee, and it was so referred,
                            
                            
                                PAPER CURRENCY.
                                Mr. TARKINGTON moved to take from the table Mr. Heffren's bill
                                    (S. 85) having reference to unsafe paper curency, that it may be
                                    placed on the files of the Senate.
                                Mr. GOODING opposed the proposition.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                Mr, WALLACE moved that the Committee on
                                        Finance be instructed to report back this joint
                                    resolution (No. 3) having reference to the interest of the State
                                    in the State Bank.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                And then the Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            MONDAY, December 20, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of Saturday was read.
                        
                            THE BLIND INSTITUTION.
                            The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the
                                Superintendent of the Institution for the Education of the Blind,
                                responding to Mr. Smith, of Perry's resolution.
                            On motion of Mr. HARNEY, it was ordered to lie on the table, and 200
                                copies be printed for the use of the House of Representatives.
                        
                        
                            FUND COMMISSIONER'S BILL.
                            Mr. HUNTER, (the rules being suspended for the purpose,) moved to
                                reconsider the vote of Saturday by which the Fund Commissioners bill
                                (H. R. 98) was recommitted to the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means.
                            Mr. MELLETT took the floor in support of the bill (98.) It had been
                                broadly declared that the proposition to appropriate a portion of
                                the Sinking Fund for the purposes of the State extingences was a
                                felony. It had been called stealing. He read a passage from the
                                speech of Mr. Davis, in the Sentinel's reports, to
                                the effect that this fund belonged not to the State, but to the
                                children of the State. This he denied. Who gave it to the children?
                                It was the money of the State, earned by the State, and now in the
                                hands of the State; and, yet it had been called larceny to use it
                                temporarily for State purposes. The State might hereafter use this
                                fund for the support of common schools, but not now. He gave an
                                illustration of the right by which this find was held by the State -
                                the case of John Smith who had placed a fund in bank, in trust, for
                                the use of his son John, when he becomes of age, &c,
                            He continued to reply to the speech of the gentleman from Floyd. He
                                read the intimation, that the effect of the bill was to put all the
                                State finances into the control of the Bank of the State of Indiana.
                                This, he said, went to the extent of charging culpability upon the
                                    Committee on Ways and Means. He answered it
                                not on their behalf, because the members of that committee were able
                                to defend themselves. But he took the charge as personal to himself.
                                If this committee were guilty of a high fraud, then he was guilty as
                                accessory to their act, for he approved it with all his heart. If
                                they were to be punished he ought to suffer the same penalty. It was
                                a remarkable charge, because the gentleman from Floyd was remarkably
                                sensitive about charges made against him - making no charges
                                himself, and suffering none to be made against himand then it was an
                                insinuation of the darkest kind. He made no insinuations. He had
                                heard it stated, and it was probably true, that there was an object,
                                a purpose in defeating this bill. It was plain to any man with his
                                eyes open that the political buzzards of ill parties have scented
                                the carcass in opposition to this bill. He admitted that it was
                                nothing extraordinary that the Democrats should range themselves in
                                opposition to it; but when he saw members of his own party in
                                opposition, with features long, lank and hungry, hanging about this
                                hall for the purpose of defeating the bill, it turned all the
                                feelings of his soul into gall and bitterness. If there was a member
                                upon this floor who deserved a monument for honesty and firmness, it
                                was that man who could resist the appliances of his party and stand
                                up to the honest convictions of his heart upon this question, and
                                that man was the gentleman from Perry [Mr. Smith] a Democrat, who
                                had introduced the bill.
                            It was proper to answer all fair argumentation; and suppose it to be
                                true that this money is to go into bankwould it not be as well thus
                                as for the State funds to be handed round to the favorites of the
                                State Treasurer? But then it was said by the gentleman that this
                                Bank of the State was a monster to grind the face of the people. Was
                                not that an extraordinary intimation, coming from the man who
                                induced the introduction of the bill to charter this bank, drawn up
                                by Mr. Thomas L, Smith. He read testimony from the Bank Frauds
                                Report, to show the origin of that bill. How should the gentleman
                                now come into this hall and warn us against this bank! He imputed no
                                motive. He also read from the testimony of Horatio C. Newland, going
                                to show Mr, Davis' opinion that the Trust Funds would be safe in
                                this bank. He had a right, in this way, to look at the source whence
                                came these warnings against this bill. He would speak out, and his
                                word might go to record. Was it not extraordinary for this man to
                                impugn motives, who had spent more money for this bank charter than
                                any and all the members of the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means were likely to spend for this or any other
                                measure?
                            Mr. COLGROVE noticed the doubtful compliment of the gentleman from
                                Floyd, addressed to him for being right on this subject. If he was
                                right now, he had been so all the time and therein he had the
                                advantage of the honorable gentleman. He had been somewhat familiar
                                     with legislation with
                                regard to the Sinking Fund. Was there a proposition to read him out
                                of the Republican party? Where then should he go? If he were fated
                                to stand alone, he needed no party organization to sustain him in
                                the right, and he wanted no support if he were in the wrong. He had
                                ever characterized the chartering of the Bank of the State, as an
                                effort to steal away the whole of these funds. It was with much
                                effort that a direct proposition to this effect was put down. Again,
                                a grave proposition came from the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means of that session, declaring that these funds were
                                unsafe in the hands of the Sinking Fund Commissioners, proposing to
                                sell the old bank stock at $1 28, when the report of the
                                Commissioners showed that it was worth $1 80 to the dollar. If that
                                had succeeded, there would have been stealage to the amount of
                                $400,000 from the bank stock alone, which, with other things in the
                                proposition, would have amounted to half a million. The speech of
                                the gentleman from Henry had unmasked the whole subject, in the
                                statement that the State was under no obligation, legal or moral, to
                                repay this fund, and that it belongs to the State - not the
                                children. Then all the State has to do is to use it. Why not do it,
                                then, directly! This statement took away his confidence in some
                                degree, in the fairness of the authors and defenders of this bill.
                                He read the 114th section of the Old State Bank Charter, creating
                                this fund, and gave its history showing that this money was the
                                bondholders' till the bonds in their hands should be paid. Every
                                dollar more than shall pay those bonds belongs to tho Common School
                                Fund. This fund cost the State nothingit was not the proceeds of
                                taxation - it had cost nothing but the use of the State's name. Any
                                measure to divert this fund from its legitimate purpose, he must and
                                would oppose with his vote and influence, party or no party.
                            He respectfully submitted that this was not a safe proposition,
                                reading the llth 12th and 17th sections of the bill - giving the new
                                commissioners control of these funds. He objected, as he had before
                                stated, to the State becoming a creditor to this fund; because too
                                many, with the gentleman from Henry, entertained the opinion that
                                this fund belongs to the State. The State was heavily taxed,
                                grinding the people into the dust; and the natural feeling of the
                                representative was to put off any proposition that would increase
                                the taxes. In 1866 those bonds would be all paid, and then these
                                nearly three millions of dollars - the interest thereon - might be
                                all applied to the support of Common Schools, if we do our whole
                                duty toward that fund. The State, manifestly had no right to become
                                a creditor to this fund, unless she put herself on an equal footing
                                with other borrowers. He would strike out from the bill the 11th and
                                12th sections, because they are contained in the bill No. 99. Then
                                the bill would be all propercreating and fixing the duty of the
                                Board of commissioners. He would ask also that the State should, by
                                this act of borrowing, pledge themselves to pay the old scoreand
                                this he would apply to the bill No. 99. He read his proposed
                                amendment to the following effect:
                            "The Treasurer of State shall, on the 24th day of December, 1858,
                                appropriate all the money in his hands toward the payment of the
                                interest on the State debt,coming due on the 1st day of January,
                                1859, and shall then, on behalf of the State, open a credit with the
                                Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners for what sums may be required
                                for the payment of the January and July instalments of interest on
                                the foreign debt fcr the year 1859, and the current expenses of the
                                State for the year 1859; and all advancements made by the Statte
                                Board to the Sate shall claim interest at the rate of seven per
                                cent, per annum: Provided that nothing in this Act
                                shall be so construe as to authorize the Treasure of State to check
                                upon the said Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners, nor shall said
                                Board pay any such check, except for the payment of the interest
                                above specified, and the current expenses of the State for the year
                                1859."
                            This would forever close up the door of abuse. As the bill now stood,
                                the discretion of the Treasurer was not sufficiently restricted,
                                &c.
                            He would also make the 6th section of the bill to read as follows
                                :
                            "Whenever the revenues of the State shall have been returned to the
                                said Board of Sinking Fund Comnissioners, all advances made under
                                the acts of 1841 and 1842, and the interest on the same, shall be
                                paid as follows: The first, on the loan made under the previous act
                                of 1841, to be computed at six percent, per annum, and the interest
                                on the loan made under the act of 1842 at seven per cent. per annum;
                                and also the loan made by the said Board of Fund Commissioners to
                                the State in July, 1858, with the interest on the same, to be
                                computed at seven per cent, per annum, according to the terms of
                                said loans, together with all sums advanced under the provisions of
                                this act, with interest at the rate of seven per cent, per annum;
                                and the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners shall apply any surplus
                                that may come into their hands, beyond the requisitions of the
                                Treasury for the payment of the said interest and the current
                                expenses of the State government, to the purchase of certificates of
                                the foreign debts of the State, if the same can be obtained on
                                reasonable terms, which certificates shall be cancelled at the date
                                of the vurchase and held as vouchers by the Bsard of Sinking Fund
                                Commisioners."
                            He wanted the bill should state precisely what it means; and he
                                considered that this language could not be misconstrued. He
                                explained his amendments at length, and said that if they were
                                incorporated he could support the bill, but not otherwise.
                            Mr. HARNEY thought gentlemen did not understand the nature of the
                                opposition to this bill. He deprecated all disposition to make it a
                                party question. Some of us, and the committee also, were in a false
                                position. The two propositions ought to be separated. The
                                organization of the Sinking Fund Board should be a distinct
                                proposition. There were ample security for the payment of any debt
                                against this Fund. He would have the proceeds of this fund begin at
                                once - as soon as may be - to be applied to the common schools. But
                                this should not be complicated with the organization of the Board.
                                Nor should the Treasury question be complicated with this bill. All
                                the present objections to the Treasurer's system of using these
                                funds, he thought, by this bill, might be carried to the Sinking
                                Fund Commissioners. A large amount of discussion was expended for
                                want of distinctness in propositions. He defended the speech of Mr.
                                Davis from the personal application sought to be made of it by the
                                gentleman from Henry, (Mr. Mellett.) He thought the proposition,
                                that this fund's proceeds could not be applied to the schools till
                                the last Bond should be paid, was not good in law. This fund was the
                                guardian of the common schools. This bill was a proposition striking
                                at its very heart, and the opposition of the gentleman from Elkhart
                                was pertinent.  Where was the
                                good faith in the former loans from this fund? No provision was made
                                to pay the interest. It was a Mexican system of finance. It was to a
                                forced loan upon the fund that he objected. The State should
                                approach the fund as any other borrower. He considered the existing
                                objections to the Treasury management, and rested the blame as much
                                with the Legislature as the Treasurer. He charged it as against a
                                system that ought to be changed. " When I look at the opportunities
                                before me," said Lord Cline before the Parliament, "I am astonished
                                at my moderation." He had as much interest in taking care of the
                                Treasury as though the Treasurer belonged to the opposite party,
                                &c.
                            Mr. BLYTHE. It was a matter of gratulation that we could approach
                                this question without party feeling. He regretted that there had
                                been made to raise the party lash. He eulogized the gentleman from
                                Perry for his position to this bill. The gentleman from Floyd, if he
                                were present, would pardon him for saying that his opposition,
                                submitted last Friday, was only an admirable stump speech. The
                                objection of the opposition was to the State's use of part of a
                                trust fund; and, secondly, that the system proposed to be wiped out
                                was an old one. These were all; and he looked at these objections
                                and at the bill. We were taking part of a trust fund, therefore the
                                bill ought to fail. What was the foundation of this argument, but
                                that the State of Indiana is a scoundrel, and can not pay its
                                obligations? It was a baseless argument. With the exception of the
                                gentleman from Randolph, gentlemen in the opposition had dealt only
                                in generalities. He alleged that the provisions in the 17th section
                                of the bill were ample to secure the repayment of the loan.
                            [A Senate message now announced the passage of bills (S.107)
                                authorizing the Governor, Auditor and Secretary of State to borrow
                                from the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners to pay the January
                                interest; (S. 5) to amend the
                                32d section of the assessment act of June 21,1852; also (S. 102) to contioue the Board
                                of Sinking Fnnd Commissioners till the first Monday in April,
                                &c.]
                            Mr. COLGROVE said that section provided nothing for the payment of
                                interest.
                            Mr. BLYTHE called attention to the language of the 16th section for
                                answer. But the objection was not an argument against the principle
                                of the bill. It might, indeed, suggest amendment. The bill, he
                                affirmed, provided a sufficient guarantee for repayment - interest
                                and all. The main argument of the gentleman from Floyd was that the
                                system proposed to be set aside was an old one. But when age had
                                brought decrepitude or vice, his veneration failed him. He was
                                willing to advance, with a due regard to the past. And, in view of
                                the history of this system, he said to the gentleman from Randolph,
                                in the words of Shylock: "Now infidel, I have thee upon the hip."
                                The propriety of change in the system, was demonstrated beyond all
                                civil. Let the part of the opposition to the bill show a better plan
                                than that submitted by the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means. He yielded to no man in his affection for the
                                common schools, and would not lay his hand on this fund, unless
                                there were honesty and ability in the State enough to return it,
                                There was another subordinate objection urged by the gentleman from
                                Floyd, that there was no present exigency for this measure He took
                                issue on the allegation that the Governor, Auditor and Treasurer,
                                had power to provide by loan for the ordinary expenses of the
                                Government, read this assumed authority from the act in the
                                Statutes, prescribing the duty of the Governor, and pronounced it
                                unconstitutional and void. For this was a function not expressed in
                                the title of the act. Then there was an exigency for the passage of
                                this act, or something like it, to pay the January interest, and the
                                current ordinary expenses of the State Government. When he had
                                concluded - 
                            The House (at 4:45) adjourned.
                        
                    
                    
                        IN SENATE
                        
                            TUESDAY, December 21,1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read.
                        
                            THE OLD STATE BANK.
                            Mr. RICE, from the Committee on Finance, to which
                                was referred Mr Wallace's joint resolution (No. 3) touching the
                                indebtedness of the State Bank of Indiana to the State; reported the
                                same back for the action of the Senate.
                            Mr Rice said that the resolution called for the appointment of three
                                members of each House, to investigate the affairs of the Bank, and
                                to make a full report of the same. He said, as a member of the
                                committee, he was opposed to the resolution, because he was informed
                                by the President of the Bank, that a full report would be made of
                                the condition of the bank, at the commencement of the regular
                                session, by the officers of that institution.
                            Mr. WALLACE supported his resolution. He thought it was the duty of
                                the Legislature to investigate the affairs of the old bank. We have
                                over $1,300,000 interest in that old State Bank, and no report shows
                                where it is. He wanted to know where it was and when we should have
                                it.
                            Mr. HAMILTON thought there was no necessity for an investigation, and
                                he was opposed to the engrossment of the resolution, because there
                                was an implied censure of the officers of the bank contained in
                                it.
                            Mr. STEVENS proposed an amendment, making it the duty of the Sinking
                                Fund Board to examine and report at the next session of the General
                                Assembly. He was opposed to appointing a committee. He thought there
                                was an implied charge of corruption in the resolution.
                            Mr. WALLACE, (interrupting,) denied that there was any charge of
                                corruption in his resolution.
                            Mr. STEVENS believed the officers of that institution above
                                suspicion. He thought it was right to investigate, but believed the
                                Board was better able to examine into the matter than a committee
                                from the two Houses.
                            Mr. STEELE thought the resolution proposed the wrong way to get the
                                information desired. If the resolution had been directed to the
                                Sinking Fund Commissioners, he thought it would have been satisfactorily answered long ago.
                                He thought we would get the information at an earlier day if no
                                action at all was taken in the matter.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON could not see that this resolution would meet the
                                object of the gentleman who introduced it, but he thought there
                                should be no objection to the investigation. It was not policy to
                                adopt the amendment because it was appointing those interested to
                                make the investigation. If the investigation is worth making, it is
                                worth making right.
                            Mr. HEFFREN thought it was a question whether we had the power to
                                appoint the committee called for in the resolution.
                            Mr. GOODING thought there was nothing wrong in the matter proposed to
                                be investigated, but he would not oppose an investigation if any
                                respectable number of Senators desired it. He will never vote to
                                screen any public officer; if men whom we trust with honor betray
                                the trust, let it be published throughout the land - lay on the lash
                                and expose the scoundrel.
                            Mr. CONNER was opposed to the resolution. The President of the old
                                State Bank has not been called upon for the information sought, and
                                he thought it necessary to have a report from that officer, in order
                                that we may have a basis for an investigation. He was willing to
                                vote for the amendment proposed by the Senator from Decatur, [Mr.
                                Stevens.]
                            Mr. MARCH supposed we would all be glad to find out what is desired
                                by this resolution. The question is which is the best way to get at
                                the desired information. He thought it best to change it into a
                                resolution of the Senate asking the President of the Bank to make a
                                report of the condition of that institution. He is always in favor
                                of investigation, and if the report from the President should not be
                                satisfactory, then appoint a committee.
                            Mr. WAGNER was opposed to all resolutions in the matter, because on
                                the first of January that bank ceases to exist and its officers will
                                then undoubtedly report all the facts in the case; then a committee
                                maybe appointed, and until then a committee would have no foundation
                                to work upon whatever.
                            Mr. WEIR was in hopes this resolution, or something to that effect,
                                may pass. It was the duty of the General Assembly to inquire into
                                the whole history of this matter. He believed every thing would be
                                found correct, but that institution basbeen in operation twenty
                                years, and no investigation has yet been had. He was opposed to the
                                amendment proposed, because he wanted disinterested men to make this
                                examination. He thought it no reflection upon the officers of the
                                bank to make the investigation.
                            Mr.JOHNSTON was in favor of a thorough investigation of this Sinking
                                Fund matter, and hoped the committee proposed would be raised, and
                                that they would report at an early day.
                            Mr. RICE was as far as any Senator from opposing an investigation
                                into the affairs of the old State Bank, but there was a proper and
                                an improper way of doing it. If this committee was appointed without
                                first calling upon the officiary of the institution for a report, it
                                would be discourteous to them. If their report should not be
                                satisfactory to every Senator, then appoint a committee. He opposed
                                the resolution upon the ground that it was discourteous to send a
                                committee to examine into their affairs before asking for a
                                statement from them.
                            Mr. WALLACE said, in the beginning of the session he offered this
                                resolution, when it was referred to the Committee on
                                    Finance, and he asked why it was not acted upon as
                                soon as referred?
                            Mr. RICE replied that it was discourteous to the officers of the
                                institution.
                            Mr. WALLACE could see no discourtesy in it - no charge, not even an
                                insinuation was contained in the resolution against the President of
                                that institution.
                            Mr. MURRAY held that it was the imperative duty of the Legislature co
                                appoint a committee of investigation as soon as the report of the
                                Board of Commissionors shall come in; but he thought a committee
                                should not be sent to disturb them at this time, while they are
                                engaged in preparing a report to submit o the regular session of the
                                Legislature on the 6th day of January next. He opposed the
                                resolution because he believed it premature.
                            Mr. BOBBS said at the commencement of the regular session we would
                                have a report from the Commissioners, and if it was not satisfactory
                                he would himself, if no one else did, move an investigation. He
                                would vote for the resolution if it were so demanded as to call for
                                an investigation into the affairs of all the State officers.
                            Mr. WALLACE was willing to such a modification of his resolution.
                            Mr. STEVENS moved to lay the resolution and amendment on the
                                table.
                            The motion was rejected by yeas 20, nays 27.
                            Mr. CRAVENS moved to amend the amendment so that provision shall be
                                made for a like investigation into the condition of the other
                                officers connected with the public service.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON moved to lay the amendment of Mr. Steven's on the
                                table
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON moved to amend so as to include an examination into the
                                condition of all the school funds belonging to the State.
                            This amendment was rejected upon a division; 20 to 21.
                            The question being upon the amendment proposed by Mr. Cravens, it was
                                adopted by yeas 49, nays 0.
                            Mr MURRAY moved its reference to a committee of three or five.
                            Mr. WALLACE thought there was no need of a reference.
                            Mr. MURRAY withdrew his motion.
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved that the joint resolution be considered as
                                engrossed and read the third time now.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the resolution was read through the
                                third time.
                            The question being, "Shall the joint resolution pass?" it was finally
                                passed the Senate by yets 50, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            Mr. CRAVENS moved that the Senate take up the message from the
                                Governor.
                            The message was taken up by consent, and read through by the
                                Secretary, as follows: 
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Gentlemen of the Senate :
                                        

                                        I return to you enrolled bill of the Senate No
                                            28,entitled, "An Act to prescribe the time, place and
                                            manner of electing United States Senators and to fix the
                                            penalty upon officers failing to certify to said
                                            election."
                                        It is to be regretted that there should be any necessity
                                            for State legislation on this subject.
                                        The Constitution of the United States confers upon
                                            Congress full power to regulate the time and manner of
                                            choosing Senators. The authors of that Constitution
                                            anticipated that confusion might arise from the
                                            conflicting rules of the States - that even some States
                                            might decline entirely to be represented in the
                                            Senate.
                                        The result of the failure of Congress to exercise the
                                            power conferred upon it, has been that conflicting rules
                                            and regulations have been adopted in reference to the
                                            manner of elections, to such an extent that it is now
                                            apparent that no uniform rule can be adopted on the
                                            subject until Congress executes the provision of the
                                            Constitution to which I have before alluded.
                                        But since Congress has failed to pass any law upon tie
                                            subject, and inasmuch as there is no rule provided by
                                            the Legislature of the State, I regard it as highly
                                            proper that one should be established.
                                        But in establishing the regulation which shall prevail in
                                            the future, would it not be wise to so make it, that
                                            hereafter, we may avoid all difficulty on the subject?
                                            You are not unmindful of the history of this question in
                                            the State. Frequently the election of United States
                                            Senators has been the all absorbing question before the
                                            Legislature, and for this reason great public interests
                                            have been neglected, domestic legislation, in which the
                                            welfare of the State, and the happiness of her people
                                            were involved, have been disregarded. The differences of
                                            opinion between the two Houses of the General Assembly,
                                            as to the propriety of elections, and the persons to be
                                            chosen, have been so great, that at sometimes no
                                            election has been had, and our State for years in part
                                            been unrepresented in the United States Senate. I make
                                            no inquiry as to who has done right or wrong in these
                                            various conflicts.
                                        Each individual who has been an actor in the scenes is
                                            responsible for the part he has taken to the
                                            constituency he represented, and in a free government,
                                            like our own, an intelligent and patriotic people will
                                            give to each his just reward or punishment, as his
                                            conduct may deserve.
                                        More harmony will prevail in your deliberations, less
                                            excitement be occasioned among the constituents you
                                            represent, should a law be passed that placed it beyond
                                            the power of either House of the General Assembly, by
                                            its separate action to defeat an election of United
                                            States Senators.
                                        Section 2d of the Bill you have passed requires that a
                                            majority of the whole number of the members of the
                                            Senate, and a majority of the whole number of the
                                            members of the House shall be necessary to designate the
                                            Senator. If such majority of each branch of the General
                                            Assembly could be procured, it would be a simple mode of
                                            election. But the history of the State shows that in
                                            times past, on several occasions, no such concurrent
                                            majority could be procured; and for that reason the
                                            State has been without her proper representation in the
                                            Senate.
                                        It is desirable that at all times, Indiana should have
                                            her full constitutional delegation in the Senate; and
                                            the Legislature should endeavor to place it there, if it
                                            can be done without doing violence to our Constitution.
                                            The practice heretofore has been to require a majority
                                            of the General Assembly to choose the Senators.
                                        It has been sometimes impossible to bring the Houses
                                            together so that a vote could be obtained. If the law
                                            provided for the creation of a joint convention, or any
                                            other mode of election whereby a majority of the General
                                            Assembly could elect the Senators, so far as the mode
                                            and manner of election is concerned, it would command my
                                            approval. But there are provisions in the bill which, in
                                            my judgment, are in conflict with the Constitution of
                                            the State.
                                        Section 3d of the Bill prescribes the duties of the
                                            President and Secretary of the Senate, the Speaker and
                                            Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary
                                            of State, and Sections declares that a failure, neglect
                                            or refusal of any of the above named officers, or either
                                            of them, to perform the duties to them assigned, shall
                                            render them guilty of a misdemeanor and subject them to
                                            the penalty of a fine.
                                        The 19th section of Article 4 of the Constitution of the
                                            State provides that "Every Act shall embrace but one
                                            subject and matters property connected therewith, which
                                            subject shall be expressed in the title."
                                        The Supreme Court of the State in the case of the Indiana
                                            Central Railway Co. vs. Potts and others, 7th Indiana
                                            Reports 681, have construed this section of the
                                            Constitution. They held that provision for a criminal
                                            prosecution cannot be included in a civil act. The court
                                            has fully discussed this section of the Constitution,
                                            showing the reasons why and the necessity for its
                                            adoption. Section 20 of the same Article declares that
                                            the General Assembly shall not pass local or special
                                            laws for the punishment of crimes and misdemeanors. This
                                            bill provides that the officers of the Legislature,
                                            chosen by each branch, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
                                            in the special case there named, while in no way held
                                            responsible for any other derelectionof duty. The only
                                            way in which they can be punished is by a general act,
                                            making it an offense to refuse to obey the orders of the
                                            House where said officers are elected.
                                        Again, the bill provides that the Secretary of State
                                            shall attach the seal of State to the certificates of
                                            election, and upon failure thus to do he shall be guilty
                                            of a misdemeanor. I know of no section of the
                                            Constitution which gives to the Secretary control of the
                                            seal of the State. Section 5 of Article 15 of the
                                            Constitution provides that there shall be a seal of
                                            State, kept by the Governor, which shall be called "the
                                            seal of the State of Indiana." It would be manifestly
                                            unjust to punish that officer for failing to perform an
                                            act not in his power. But if the seal of the State was
                                            intrusted to his keeping, and he alone required to
                                            impress it as an evidence of the official action of the
                                            Legislature, a failure on his part to obey the direction
                                            of the Legislature gives to

                                        that body no power to puuish him by either fine or
                                            imprisonment. Section 1 of Article 6 of the Constitution
                                            provides that "there shall be elected by the voters of
                                            the State a Secretary, an Auditor and a Treasurer of
                                            State, who shall severally hold their offices for two
                                            years. They shall perform such duties as may be enjoined
                                            by law." Section 7 of the same Art. provides that "all
                                            State officers shall, for crime, incapacity or
                                            negligence, be liable to be removed from office, either
                                            by impeachment by the House of Representatives, to be
                                            tried by the Senate, or by a joint resolution of the
                                            General Assembly, two thirds of the members elected to
                                            each branch voting in either case therefor."
                                        The Secretary of State holds an office created by the
                                            Constitution. He is elected by the people to discharge
                                            the duties assigned to him by the Constitution and the
                                            laws of the State. He is required to take his oath of
                                            office, that he will obey the Constitution and discharge
                                            his duties. It by any act of his personal wrong is done
                                            to a citizen, the remedy for that wrong is upon his
                                            official bond. If he is guilty of a crime or
                                            misdemeanor, for the punishment of which the criminal or
                                            penal code ot the State provides, he is liable to be
                                            punished upon information or indictment. But for a
                                            failure to discharge his official duties he can only be
                                            punished in accordance with the provision of the
                                            Constitution, as heretofore set forth in Section 7, of
                                            Article 6 - that is, by impeachment or removal from
                                            office. The people of the State, in the adoption of the
                                            section above mentioned, provided the means whereby the
                                            offi ;ers of State, by them chosen, should be punished
                                            for official negligence. They conferred upon the General
                                            Assembly the power to arraign such officers before them,
                                            and depose them for a failure to discharge their duties.
                                            They never did confer upon the General Assembly the
                                            power to punish, in a court of justice, any of the State
                                            officers above mentioned for failure to perform any of
                                            the duties assigned them by law. They gave to every
                                            officer of State the same right as they did to every
                                            member of the General Assembly, after taking his oath to
                                            support the Constitution of the State, according to his
                                            own judgmentto put his consfruction thereon. They
                                            provided no punishment except that of expulsion for
                                            neglect of duty on the part of a member of the General
                                            Assembly, of which negligence the House to which he
                                            belonged could alone decide, and of the negligence of an
                                            officer of State they provided that the General Assem
                                            bly could alone decide. Therefore, the provision of this
                                            bill which subjects the Secretary of State to punishment
                                            for a neglect to execute your commands, I regard as
                                            clearly in violation of the Constitution.
                                        For these reasons I can not approve the bill.

                            SENATE BILL NO. 28.

                                the time, when according to law such vacancy will occur, and the
                                places of holding such election shall be the same as now, or may
                                hereafter be prescribed by law for the settings of the two Houses of
                                the General Assembly.
                            SEC. 2. The manner of said election shall be by viva
                                    voce vote of the Senate and House of Representatives,

                                the Senate, and a majority of the whole nember of the members of the

                                necessary to an election.
                            SEC. 3. It is hereby declared to be the duty of the Secretary of the
                                Senate, and of the Clerk of the House of Representatives to spread

                                copies of the journals of the two Houses verified by the affidavit
                                of any sworn officer, or by any member of the respective Houses
                                composing the General Assembly, shall in all cases, and for all
                                purposes, be deemed, taken and received as competent and sufficient
                                evidence of such election. Provided, however, that such sworn copy
                                or copies of such journals, shall in all cases be accompanied by a
                                resolution of each House, declaring the neglect, failure or refusal

                                hereinbefore prescribed, and a
                                copy of such resolutions sworn to as provided for in the case of the
                                journal aforesaid, shall in all cases be deemed and taken and
                                received as sufficient evidence of such neglect, failure or refusal
                                on the part of such officer or officers, and shall entitle the
                                aforesaid sworn copies of the journals of the two Houses of the
                                General Assembly to the same faith and credit as if certified under
                                the broad seal of the State, as hereinbefore provided.
                            SEC. 4. The elections herein provided for may be entered into at any
                                time in either House, upon motion and assent of the House thereto.

                                officers of the respective Houses.
                            SEC. 5. The failure, neglect or refusal of any one of the officers
                                named in the third section of this act, upon the request of any
                                person elected to the office of Senator of the United States, as
                                herein provided, to perform any duty or duties imposed upon him by
                                this act, shall be deemed, and is hereby declared to be a
                                misdemeanor; and upon prosecution by information in the Court of
                                Common Pleas of Marion County, and conviction thereof, the person so
                                failing, or neglecting, or refusing, shall sbe fined in any sum not
                                less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars.
                            SEC. 6. Inasmuch as this State is now wholly unrepresented in the
                                Senate of the United States, no person having been elected thereto
                                by the legislature of the State, since the session of the General
                                Assembly, in the year One Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty-Three,
                                and it is necessary that an election to fill the vacancies in said
                                office occasioned thereby, an emergency exists for the immediate
                                taking effect of this Act. It is, therefore, hereby declared to be
                                in full force from and after its passage.
                            The question being, "Shall the bill pass, the objections of the
                                Governor to the contrary, notwithstanding?" - 
                            Mr. GOODING said he would vote for the bill if he were satisfied that
                                it was constitutional. He desired that the vote be postponed till 2
                                o'clock, and he would try to examine into the constitutionality of
                                the bill by that time. When he voted for the passage of the bill his
                                attention was not called to the points suggested by the Governor. He
                                would shirk from no responsibility, and would cheerfully vote for
                                the bill were the constitutional objections urged against it
                                removed. If the vote was gone into now he would be compelled to
                                withhold his vote upon its passage, although he desired to vote for
                                some such law.
                            The question being called for all over the Senate, a constitutional
                                provision demanding the yeas and nays, the PRESIDENT directed the
                                Secretary to call Senators for their votes, and the bill was passed,
                                the objections of the Governor to the contrary notwithstanding, by
                                yeas 26, nays 23 - as follows:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS - Messrs. Anthony, Beeson, Bennett, Blair, Bobbs,
                                            Brown, Conner, Cooper, Cravens, Craven, Culver,Green,
                                            Hendry, Hill, Jones, Kinley, March, Murray, Rice,
                                            Robinson, Steele, Stevens, Thompson, Turner, Wagner and
                                            Weir - 26.

                                            Hargrove, Heffren, Jennings, Johnston, Line, Lomax,
                                            McLure, McLean, Miller, O'Brien, Odell, Shoemaker Slack,
                                            Studabaker, Tarkington, Wallace, Williams and Wilson -
                                            23.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. ANTHONY, when his name was called explained his vote at
                                considerable length. He was loath to vote for any bill over the veto
                                of the Governor, if he considered it based upon good grounds; but he
                                really could see no substantial reasons for believing the bill to be
                                unconstitutional, or that it was a want of policy to pass it at this
                                time
                            Mr. GOODING, when his name was called, said he had already signified
                                his approbation of the general provisions of the bill; but as the
                                Senate had refused to grant him time to examine into its
                                constitutionality, he asked to be excused from voting
                            Mr. MURRAY, when his name was called, explained the reasons for his
                                vote. He should certainly not be influenced by any argument coming
                                from his Excellency, although he had a high opinion of the
                                Governor's decisions outside of politics.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER, when his name was called, explained his vote in a
                                little speech.
                            Mr WALLACE, when his name was called, said he believed this act to be
                                unconstitutional, and that a better bill of the same kind and
                                character as this, was on the files of the Senate which he would
                                much rather see passed.
                            Mr. WEIR, when his name was called, said: I find that one great
                                objection urged by his Excellency in his veto message, is, that the
                                law contains two subject matters, and he therefore concludes that it
                                is unconstitutional. I would call gentlemen's attention to the law
                                known as the charter of the Bank of the State of Indiana. It
                                contains precisely the same objection here urged by the Governor,
                                providing punishment for the infringement of its provisions. I refer
                                to sections 75 and 76 of that act, and if I mistake not, the
                                Governor then approved of the passage of that bill by his vote;
                                hence I conclude that in this particular his objection is not well
                                founded, and though he may have changed his opinion from what it
                                then was, I am of opinion he then held a different view on that
                                question. I therefore vote "yea," the Governor's objection to the
                                contrary.
                        
                        
                            MESSAGES FROM THE GOVERNOR.
                            Pending the call, a message from the Governor by his private
                                Secretary, Mr. Osborne, informed the Senate that he had signed and
                                approved the following bills:

                            The bill (H. R. 23) to repeal

                                receive conveyances of lands and donations of personal property.
                            The bill (H. R. 32) to repeal
                                the Calumet Feeder Dam law of March 7,1857.

                                in the counties, and have exercised corporate power.
                        
                        
                            MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE.
                            A message was received from the House of Representatives by Mr. Ryan,

                            Mr. SLACK moved that the order of business be suspended to enable him
                                to introduce a resolution to adjourn sine die.
                            Mr. HENDRY demanded a call of the Senare.
                            The call was proceeded with, and forty-five Senators were reported as
                                being present.
                            Mr. HAMILTON moved that further proceedings in the call be dispensed

                            Mr. GREEN moved that the absentees - Messrs. Bobbs, Cravens, Culver,

                            Mr. HEFFREN thought they ought to be read, and moved a
                                reconsideration of the vote by which they were referred.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the communication from the Blind Asylum
                                was read.

                                The report was concurred in by consent.

                                Mr. HEFFREN from the select committee to which was referred the
                                    bill (H. R. 9) to prevent the circulation of unauthorized paper
                                    currency, reported the same back with an amendment, striking out
                                    all after the enacting clause, and recommended its passage.
                                The report was concurred in by consent.
                                The bill was read through the first time.

                                Mr. HEFFREN withdrew his motion.

                                Mr. WEIR moved to reconsider the vote by which it was refused to
                                    engross joint resolution (No. 6) disapproving of the course of
                                    Messrs. Bright and Fitch.
                                Mr. HEFFREN demanded a call of the Senate.
                                The call was proceeded with, and every Senator was reported as
                                    being present.
                                The vote was reconsidered by yeas 31, nays 19.
                                Mr. GOODING, after extended remarks, moved to strike out the
                                    second resolution.
                                Mr. WEIR, moved to amend by striking out from the title "and the
                                    removal of Hon. Stephen A. Douglas from the Chairmanship of the
                                    Committee on Territories."
                                Mr. GOODING accepted. The motion of M,. Gooding was agieed to by
                                    yeas 29, nays 21.
                                Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend by inserting after the words "Bright
                                    and Fitch," the words "our Senators in Congress."
                                Mr. GOODING moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                                The motion was agreed to by yeas 29, nays 21.
                                The question recurring on the engrossment - 
                                The resolution was ordered to be engrossed by yeas 30, nays
                                    20.
                                And then the Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            TUESDAY, December 21, 1858.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. MURRAY, the reading of the Journal of yesterday was
                            dispensed with.
                        
                            THE COMMON SCHOOLS.
                            On motion by Mr. MANSFIELD, the order of business was further
                                dispensed with, and be had leave to submit a report, as follows:
                            Mr. Speaker: The Committee on Education, to whom
                                was referred a resolution offered by the Representative from Warren,
                                stating that the State was indebted to the Sinking Fund in two
                                several debts, one of which amounted in the year 1853, to the sum of
                                $800,000 and the other to $128,000, and instructing said committee
                                to report a bill to more effectually secure said fund in payment of
                                these debts, have had the subject under consideration and they have
                                instructed me to report:
                            That the State debt of $128,000 as referred to in the resolution, has
                                already been disposed of in the House bills 98 and 99, which are now
                                pending before the House.
                            In regard to the other debt of $800,000, which was incurred by the
                                State under an act of the Legislature of February 6, 1841, and under
                                a joint resolution of January 31, 1842, the committee beg leave to
                                state that this debt with interest at the rate of six per cent, per
                                annum,is justly due to the Sinking Fund; that it is of nearly
                                eighteen years standing, that no interest has ever been paid
                                thereon, and that no provision has as yet been made for the payment
                                of the principal or for the payment of the interest. The committee
                                are of opinion that it is of vital interest to the system of our
                                common schools, and that the honor of the State requires that this
                                debt should be fully secured to the Sinking Funk without delay, and
                                thst provisions should be made for the payment of the interest
                                thereon. To this intent said committee respectfully recommend the
                                introduction of the following bill.
                            A bill (No. 101) to secure to
                                the Sinking Fund a debt which the State owes to said fund, and to
                                provide for the payment of the interest on said fund.
                            The bill was passed the first reading.
                            
                            Mr. MANSFIELD, (by unanimous consent,) said: Mr. Speaker, there has
                                been a debt, as is well known, created by the State to the Sinking
                                Fund, under the act of the Legislature of the 6th of February, 1841,
                                and another under a joint resolution of the 31st of January, 1842.
                                These two debts have run on to the present day without any provision
                                whatsoever having been made for the payment of the interest thereon.
                                That the means which are at our disposal of this Sinking Fund, and
                                which will ultimately revert to the common schools, ought to be held
                                secure for that purpose, is a matter I need not now dwell upon.
                                Where a debt has had a standing of eighteen years with out any
                                attention having been paid to it, so much as to provide for the
                                interest, I think, as in the case of an individual, the law should
                                prevent the obligation from the entire loss of his debt. This sum
                                has accumulated to such an extent - $1,100,000 - that it would be
                                burdensome to the people to cancel it at once. The provisions made
                                in the bill are, that the interest on the original debt shall run to
                                the 12th of January, 1861; that then the interest shall be added to
                                the capital and considered as together with it bringing interest
                                from that date. To secure this, the fund is to be given to the
                                custody of the Sinking Fund Commissioners, payable at any time, at
                                the pleasure of the State, bringing interest at six per cent, per
                                annum after that date - and the debt can be paid off so the burden
                                shall fall as lightly as possible on the Treasury. It will not be a
                                very great burden upon the Treasury to pay this interest in the year
                                1862. But I think, sir, that on a question of this kind, we should
                                not stop to consider whether the obligation be a heavy or a light
                                onethe question being simply whether we shall act as honest
                                menwhether we shall fulfil our obligations, or find some means for
                                avoiding them. But, sir, I will mot dwell on the subject. It is a
                                clear matter; and at the proper time I shall expect the aid of
                                friends of this fund better informed than I on the whole
                                subject.
                        
                        
                            RAILROAD APPRAISEMENTS.
                            On motion by Mr. LAWHEAD, the order of business was further
                                suspended, and the bill (S.
                                5) to amend the 31st section of the act [in reference to the
                                appraisement of railroad property in counties,] of June 21,1852, was
                                taken up, passed the first and seeond readings, and referred to the
                                    Committee on Corporations.
                        
                        
                            PILOTS OF THE OHIO FALLS.
                            Mr. CARR, (the order of business being further suspended,) from the
                                select committee to whom was referred the bill (S. 59) relative to licensing
                                pilots at the Falls of the Onio, returned the same without
                                amendment, with a recommendation that it pass; and, accordingly, the
                                bill was passed the third and last reading in the House of
                                Representatives by yeas 88, nays 9.
                        
                        
                            TELL CITY.
                            Mr. BROTHERTON, (the rule being further suspended for the purpose,)
                                submitted a report from the Committee on
                                    Corporations, returning the bill (S. 20) to authorize the
                                incorporation of Associations formed for building towns in this
                                State - [to meet the case of the Tell City Association in Perry
                                county] - with several amendments thereto, and adding a provision:
                                "That nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to exempt
                                such lands from taxation as other lands are taxed," and recommending
                                passage.
                            The amendments were concurred in.
                            On motion and explanation by Mr. BLYTHE, the amendments were
                                considered as engrossed, and the bill was passed the third and last
                                reading in the House of Representatives by yeas 82, nays 2.
                            Mr. BROTHERTON proposed amending the title better to suit the subject
                                matter of the bill, which was concurred in.
                        
                        
                            TEMPERANCE.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY, (the order being further suspended,) submitted a
                                resolution to the following effect:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That as it is of vital
                                            importance that such a temperance law should be enacted
                                            as shall meet with the approbation of the people, aud as
                                            several temperance bills are now before the committee of
                                            this House, which it will be impossible to consider at
                                            the present session, it is therefore ordered, that 200
                                            copies of each of these bilIs be printed for the use of
                                            the House ot Representatives.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was agreed to on a division - affirmative 42, negative
                                36.
                        
                        
                            THE FUND COMMISSIONERS BILL.
                            Mr. HUNTER, (the order of business being further suspended,) moved
                                that his motion of yesterday to reconsider the recommitment of the
                                bill (H.R. 98.)
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. MURRAY demanded the yeas and nays on the motion to
                                reconsider.
                            Mr. BRANHAM said this bill was of paramount importance. It was to
                                provide for the dificit in the Treasury. There was no existing law
                                by which this could be done without violating, at least, the spirit
                                of the Constitution. He was unwilling to go home without such a
                                provision of law. The measure had met with unexpected opposition.
                                With the committee it was only a choice between evils - between
                                going into the market with the bonds of the State, and borrowing
                                from the Sinking Fund. It was imperative that we should provide
                                these Sinking Fund Commissioners. He knew that the State bonds were
                                already made and signed, and probably on the way to New York; but he
                                alleged it was done in violation of the spirit of the Constitution,
                                the debt of the State involved taxation, and the right of taxation
                                belonged alone to the Representatives of the people. He rehearsed
                                the provisions of the bill. It makes an assignment of the State
                                revenue to reimburse the Sinking Fund. What objection could there be
                                to that? It was obliged to be loaned or locked up. The officers of
                                the fund had assured him that six per cent, on the loan to the State
                                would be better than seven per cent, loans on mortgages. He spoke
                                against the present system ot managing the public finances, not
                                against the State officers, He might yet offer them a vote of thanks
                                for having done as well as they have under the injudicious
                                discretions allowed to them by law.
                            Were gentlemen willing to go home and shirk the responsibility of
                                amending the law in this respect? He would not touch the fund, but
                                to benefit the fund itself. A domestic debt would be much more
                                likely to be provided for than a  foreign one. He believed the present incumbent of the treasury
                                had acted with a fidelity unsurpassed by any of his predecessors.
                                The reputation of these citizens of the State was the brightest
                                heritage we have. Some things had been unfortunate - calling loudly
                                for amendment of the law. He said the system we had given justified
                                the officers in the discretion they had taken. Their duty should be
                                distinctly and definitely defined. He was as ready as any man to
                                vote for repaying the loans of 1841 and 1842. He would give the best
                                assurance of good faith in making the proposed loan from this fund.
                                It was only a temporary measure. He complained of the op position to
                                bills because no better system was proposed by its enemies. This
                                bill came in by the unanimous recommendation of the committee, and
                                it had been resisted at every step since its introduction on the
                                12th of December. If it was not right, vote it down; but gentlemen
                                should remember, it is much easier to vote down the bill than to
                                provide the remedy. Should it go to the country that we are unable
                                to devise a safe and adequate system of revenue? He admitted that
                                the report of the Committee on Ways and Means on
                                the assetts of the State was crude and unreliable; but he ventured
                                the estimates would be sustained by time and events. There was
                                another bill we ought to have up - that is for the cancellation of
                                the stock of the State. He insisted on action, and could not expect
                                unanimity, &c. He had been amongst those in a former
                                Legislature, who had successfully resisted the proposition to place
                                these funds in the Bank of the State. He insisted, at all hazards,
                                to pay the interest on the public debt - to preserve the public
                                honor inviolate. The acts of the Governor and Auditor were void in
                                these loan negotiations - but this did not go to a declaration that
                                they should not be paid. The loan of $165,000 of last July was not
                                necessary to meet the interest on the public debt. The State of
                                Indiana held $391,000 of her own stocks, yet these men propose to
                                borrow money to pay the interest on tuese stocks in their own
                                hands!
                            Mr. MURRAY was opposed to the motiono to reconsider, He replied to
                                Mr. Branham. There was on the table two distinct propositions
                                sufficient to meet the State's exigencies - one to authorize the
                                necessary loan from the Sinking Fund, and the proposition to
                                continue that Board. Let these bills be passed, and if they are not,
                                the responsibility of their failure must rest with the
                                    Committee on Ways and Means, because they
                                have so zealously pressed this measure.
                            Mr. TURPIE argued against the bill, from the nature of the trust
                                funds, referring to the constitutional provision in reference to the
                                same. How could it be a faithful application of the Sinking Fund to
                                subject it to the check of the Treasurer? He would vote for the
                                embezzlement bill of Mr. Mellett, and the abstract proposition for a
                                loan to pay the January interest. The very amendments of the
                                committee themselves was a confession of the imperfections of the
                                bill. He argued against the practicability of the bill in its
                                present shape, giving numerous illustiations. The Treasurer will be
                                a mere automaton, a shadow, by the side of the Board of Fund
                                Commissioners. The Board would just pay such checks as they please.
                                They would have the pocket lien on the State, and the Treasurer's
                                checks would be waste paper. The bill was incompatible, also, with
                                the revenue bill already passed and signed by the Governor. The
                                Treasurer was a constitutional officer elected by the people, but
                                this bill was to set him aside for a Board of Commissioners not only
                                not elected by the people, but thev were to be eligible for an
                                indefinite period.
                            Mr. DAVIS took the floor and spoke at length in opposition to tne
                                financial system proposed in the bill and to the motion to
                                reconsider. His speech, written out by the Reporter, is reserved for
                                correction, and will appear hereafter.
                            Whilst he occupied the floor - 
                            A message from the Senate announced the passage in that body of the
                                bill (S. 28) prescribing time
                                and manner of the election of United States Senators, &c The
                                objections of the Governor to the contrary notwithstanding.
                            A message was received from the Governor by Mr. Osborn, Executive
                                Messenger, announcing that he approved and signed the bills (S. 3, H. R. 39, &c.,) as in the
                                report of the Senate proceedings above.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry, next obtained the floor, and spoke at length in
                                support of the bill. His remarks, written out by the Reporter, are
                                withheld for authentication. He concluded by demanding the previous
                                question.
                            There was a second for the previous question, and under its operation
                                the vote consigning the bill again to the Committee on Ways

                            Mr. Stanfield had paired off with Mr Merrifield.
                            And then the question recurred on the motion to recommit.
                            The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            A call of the House ascertained the presence of 98 members.
                            Mr. GREGORY moved to lay the motion to recommit the bill to the
                                    Committee on Ways and Means on the table,
                                demanding the yeas and nays.
                            Mr. BAIRD explained his vote. He should vote to lay on the table,
                                without being committed either for or against the bill.
                            The vote resulted - yeas 51, nays 46. So the motion to recommit lies
                                on the table, and the question recurred on the engrossment of the
                                bill.
                            
                            Mr.COLGROVE moved to amend the bill by striking out sections 11 and
                                12, (heretofore described.) These sections, he said, were not
                                necessary to the bill. With an amendment to sections 1 and 6 of the
                                bill 99,and striking out these 11th and 12th sections, he could
                                support the measures; and without the support of those who stood
                                with him it was psssible that the bill could not pass. He demanded
                                the yeas and nays on his motion, which, being ordered and taken,
                                resulted - yeas 47, nays 50 - as follows:

                            So the House refused to strike out.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY proposed to amend the 14th section of the bill, by
                                inserting after the word "made," these words: "to the State officers
                                for the payment of the July, 1858. instalment of interest on the
                                foreign debt." The object was to remove an ambiguity in the bill. It
                                might, without this amendment, be construed that the Sinking Fund
                                should have a lien until all the advancements heretofore made by it
                                to the State shall have been paid.
                            The amendment was adopted without a division.
                            Mr. AUSTIN now demanded the previous question, and under the
                                operation thereof the main question, viz: Shall the bill be
                                engrossed for a third reading, was then taken - the vote resulting -

                                ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                                On motion by Mr. MURRAY, the order of business was suspended, and
                                    the bill (S. 28)
                                    prescribing the time and manner of the election of United States
                                    Senators, &c., was taken up, as communicated this day from
                                    the Senate, it having been passed by that body, notwithstanding
                                    the Governor's objections. The question being,shall the bill
                                    pass, notwithstanding the objections of the Governor?
                                The bill was again read through by the Clerk, with the Governor's
                                    objections thereto. Mr. BLYTHE regretted to find himself obliged
                                    to vote against the passage of the bill. He regretted this
                                    because of the inconvenience it might bring to the Republican
                                    party, but still he must do his duty. He was convinced that the
                                    Governor's view was right, and according to his sense of right
                                    he must sustain him. He called the attention of the House to the
                                    title of the bill. It was to fix the time and manner of this
                                    election and to prescribe penalties. There were two subjects
                                    embraced in the bill, whereas, as the Governor says, the
                                    Constitution prescribes that a bill shall embrace but one
                                    subject and matter pertaining thereto. He also concurred in the
                                    objection of the Governor, taken with reference to the penalty.
                                    If his attention had been called to the matter earlier, the
                                    result might have been different. but now he must sustain the

                        On motion by Mr. HARGROVE, the vote of yesterday, by which the

                            Mr. HEFFREN moved that the order of business be dispensed with, and
                                that his bill (S. 109) with regard to the circulation of uncurrent
                                paper money, be taken up and read the second time.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON demanded the previous question on the engrossment of
                                the bill.
                            There being a second, under the operation of the previous question
                                the bill was passed the second reading and ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY BOUNDARIES.
                            Mr. WAGNER, by unanimous consent, submitted a report from the Select
                                Committee to which was referred the bill (H. R. 11) repealing
                                section 2 of an act for the formation of new counties and changing
                                county boundaries, returning the same and recommending its
                                passage.
                            Mr. MURRAY moved that the report and bill lay upon the table.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                        
                        
                            PUBLICATION OF LEGAL ADVERTISEMENTS.
                            Mr. CONNER, from the Judiciary Committee to which
                                was referred a resolution of the Senate inquiring into the
                                expediency of the publication of all acts containing an emergency
                                clause, in at least one newspaper in each county in the State,
                                reported that in the opinion of the committee the enacting of such a
                                law was expedient, and recommended the passage of a bill to that
                                effect.
                            The yeas and nays were demanded on concurring in the report.
                            [A message from the House of Representatives was received, announcing
                                that the House had concurred in the Senate amendments to the bill
                                    (H. R. 79) to provide for
                                the relocation of county seats and buildings, where two-thirds of
                                the voters petition therefor.]
                            Mr. CONNER urged the adoption of the report of the committee. He
                                thought it right to publish all acts containing an emergency clause
                                in at least one paper in each county of the State, and if no other
                                gentleman did he would introduce a bill at the next session to that
                                effect.
                            Mr. GREEN was also in favor of the adoption of the report. He thought
                                the printers throughout the State would be willing to print the laws
                                (or a very small compensation - probably the simple cost of setting
                                the type.
                            Mr. JOHNSTON hoped this report would no be concurred in. He was
                                opposed to the passaeg of acts containing an emergency clauseit was
                                in opposition to the interest of the people of the State, and ought
                                not to be done. In some cases where public officers are concerned,
                                it may be perhaps necessary, but in such cases the persons
                                interested have ample means of ascertaining the passage of such
                                acts. He did not think the enacting of such a bill as recommended by
                                the report would accomplish anything, but help to support a paper in
                                each county of the State, and for that reason he opposed it.
                            Mr. MURRAY said, the Senator from Putnam [Mr. Johnston] misapprehends
                                the effect of the passage of such a law. He thought the very fact
                                that it will be attended with expense to the people of the State,
                                would make their representatives more careful about inserting the
                                emergency clause. When we pass an act and make it to be in force
                                from and after its publication in the Indianapolis
                                    Journal and Sentinel, as by our laws,
                                every man is bound to know the law, we ought to give the people an
                                opportunity of knowing what the law is. In Ohio, all the laws,
                                whether they contain an emergency clause or not, are published in
                                every county in the State where there is a newspaper.
                            The report was concurred in by yeas 27, nays 32, as follows:

                                bill (S. 108) authorizing the payment of school funds retained in
                                county treasuries by injunction of courts, reported the same back,
                                and recommended its indefinite postponement.

                                (H. R. 36) to amend section 1 of an act providing for extending
                                terms of Circuit Courts by adjournment, &c., approved February,
                                12,1855, and authorizing the holding of special terms thereof, and
                                fixing pay to Judges and Attorneys in attendance thereon, reported
                                the same back with an amendment, and recommended its passage.
                            After remarks thereon by Messrs. March, Weir, Green and Hendry - 
                            The report was concurred in.
                            [A message was received from the House of Representatives announcing
                                to the Senate the passage by

                            Mr. STEVENS moved to amend the bill by requiring county officers to
                                make application to the judge when they think the interest of the
                                county requires an extra term, and fixing his salary at $5 per day
                                and 10 cents mileage. Mr. MURRAY proposed to amend the bill so that
                                the Board of County Commissioners may allow such compensationas they
                                may think proper, to be paid out of the county treasury.

                                providing a suitable penalty for the circulation, within this State,

                                    session of 1857. I then had and still have serious doubts of the

                                    save the benefit of those doubts to the Democratic pariy, ol
                                    which I then was and still am an humble member. My participation
                                    in that election was reluctant, and I frankly confess that
                                    subsequent events have not removed my doubts,
                                    nor do I believe that the peace, harmony, or success of the
                                    Democratic party was thereby promoted. That the course of
                                    Messrs. Bright and Fitch and others in their lead, in their
                                    attempt to make the advocacy and support of Lecomptonism a test of Democracy,
                                    have done more to defeat and break down the Democratic party in
                                    this State than all the Republicans in it. The persecution of
                                    the friends of Judge Douglas and Governor Wright by those men
                                    assuming the leadership of the party is unjust, impolitic and
                                    insufferable, and must cease, otherwise there can be no
                                    peace.
                                We cannot, we will not stand by and hold the clothes of those
                                    that stone Stephen, nor will we consent unto his death, nor that
                                    he be slain in the house of his friends.
                                I represent a district overwhelmingly Democratic, and can not and
                                    will not misrepresent my constituents by voting for a Republican
                                    on the one hand, nor a Lecomptonite on the other, for the United
                                    States Senatorship, until otherwise instructed by them.
                                Our objections to Messrs. Bright and Fitch are that they have
                                    denied the faith and repudiated the time honored principles of Democracy, by which
                                    we intend to stand whoever may prove faithless. We follow
                                    principles, and men only as they are true to those principles.
                                    We have strong attachments to the organization of the Democratic
                                    party, but still stronger for its principles as we have
                                    understood them.
                                From what I have already said it will appear that I cannot vote
                                    for this resolution.
                                So the resolution was adopted.
                                Mr. CRAVENS then nominated Henry S. Lane for United States
                                    Senator till the 4th of March, 1863.
                                The PRESIDENT directed the roll called, and 26 Senators voted for

                                                Slack, Studabaker, Tarkington, Wallace, Williams and
                                                Wilson.
                                            Absent - 
                                            Mr. Heffren.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. JONES nominated William M. McCarty for United States Senator
                                    till the 4th of March, 1861.
                                The result of the call of the roll was the same as in the case of
                                    Mr. Lane.

                                Mr. CONNER moved that further proceedings in the call be
                                    dispensed with.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                                And then the Senate adjourned.

                                taken up. Besides clerical amendments the Senate have added sections

                            SEC. 18. That nothing herein shall be taken or considered as
                                repealing: any of the provisions of the Act for the relocation of

                            INDEPENDENT TREASURY.
                            Mr. JONES (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill (No. 102) to
                                establish the Independent Treasury of the State of Indiana, to
                                provide for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public money of
                                the State, and of the several counties thereof; creating the office
                                of Comptroller of the Treasury and prescribing the manner of his

                                the duties of the Treasurer of State, Auditor of State, and other
                                State officers, and the duties of County Auditors and Treasurers and
                                other county officers; for the examination of the State and County

                                the affirmative - 
                            The bill was read the second time by title.
                            Mr. PROSSER moved that it be laid on the table and that 200 copies be
                                printed.
                            Mr. KEEFER proposed 500 copies, which was agreed to, and the order
                                was made accordingly.
                        
                        
                            HOUSES OF REFUGE.
                            Mr. DOBBINS, (by leave,) from the select committee of one from each
                                Congressional District, to whom was referred the resolution of the
                                House making it their duty to report a bill for the erection and
                                maintenance of three Houses of Refuge for the correction of juvenile
                                offenders, reported the expression of opinion that the Legislature
                                ought to make provision at as early a day as possible for these
                                objects, but owing to the lateness of the day of the session they
                                deem it inexpedient at this time to report a bill, &c.
                            The House refused to concur in this report.
                        
                        
                            A LICENSE LAW.
                            Mr. AUSTIN, (by consent,) from the Committee on
                                    Temperance, to which sundry propositions on the
                                subject had been referred, reported back the petition and papers
                                that had been referred to them, and returned a license law bill,
                                stating the reasons which had induced the report - that it was not
                                such a bill as could meet with the approval of the committee, but,
                                under all the circumstances, the committee supposed it the best
                                thing that could be done by this General Assembly.
                            On motion by Mr. Davis, the report and bill were laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. BLYTHE, (by consent,) from the Special Committee, to whom was
                                referred Mr. Mansfield's bill (H. R. ) (a license law) reported the
                                same back with sundry clerical and immaterial amendments, with a
                                favorable recommendation.
                            The report was concurred in and the bill was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            ABANDONED ROADS.
                            Mr. COMSTOCK, (by consent,) from the Committee on
                                    Roads, returned the bill (S. 15) and the amendments
                                thereto, with sundry amendments, stating that the emergency clause
                                had been stricken out under instructions from the House, and not on
                                the motion of the committee.
                            On motion by Mr. R1TTER, the emergency clause was restored.
                            Mr. GIFFORD moved to amend further adding appropriately these words:
                                "And all claims thereto relinquished by the said company," which was
                                rejected.
                            Mr. Hall, of Rush, made an ineffectual motion to refer again to a
                                Select Committee.
                            The report was then concurred in, and the bill ordered to engrossment
                                and passed the third reading.
                        
                        
                            ABSENCE.
                            On motion by Mr. DAVIS, Mr. Murray, from the counties of Elkhart aud
                                Lagrange, had leave of absence from and after to morrow at twelve
                                o'clock M.
                        
                        
                        
                            CLERKS AND EMPLOYEES.
                            Mr. BRANHAM, (by unanimous consent,) submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Chairmen of the
                                            several committees Of the House of Representatives who
                                            have employed clerks forthwith report their names and
                                            the number of days employed respectively to the
                                                Committee on Ways and Means.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. STANFIELD proposed to amend by including all the employees by the
                                authority of the House of Representatives.
                            The amendment was concurred in, and so the resolution was
                                adopted.
                        
                        
                            RAILROAD PROPERTY APPRAISEMENTS.
                            Mr. STILES, (by unanimous consent,) from, the Committee on
                                    Corporations, returned the engrossed bill (S. 35) to
                                amend the MM section of the Assessment Act of June 21, 1852, with a
                                recommendation that the same do pass.
                            Mr. STANFIELD. The bill was for the pur pose of clearing up doubt in
                                regard to the assess meat of real estate belonging to railroad
                                companies, and therefore it should be passed at once.
                            So the bill passed the House of Representatives.
                        
                        
                            AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES' LAND.
                            On motion of Mr. LEWIS, (the order of business being further
                                suspended for the purpose,) the engrossed bill (S. 60) to amend the Act of
                                February 7, 1855, authorizing County Agricultural Societies to hold
                                real estate - [75 acres] - was taken up and passed the third and
                                last reading by yeas 85, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            COMMISSIONERS' COURT.
                            On motion by Mr. DOUGHERTY, (the order being further suspended for
                                the purpose,) the engrossed bill (H. R. 60) to amend the 6th section
                                of the Act of June 17, 1852, requiring the Court of County
                                Commissioners to meet in the Auditor's office in term time of the
                                other Courts was taken up.
                            On motion by Mr. GRIFFIN, the bill was amended, by substituting "may"
                                for "shall," and so the bill passed the final reading in the House
                                of Representatives by yeas 87, nays 5.
                        
                        
                            A PUBLIC LOAN.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry, (the order of business being further suspended
                                for the pupose,) reported the following from the Committee
                                    on Ways and Means:
                            A joint resolution (No. 4)
                                directing the Treasurer of State to appropriate all the moneys in
                                his hands, as therein provided, and directing the Governor, Auditor
                                and Treasurer of State, to borrow money of the Commissioners of the
                                Sinking Fund, or elsewhere, giving the preference to the Sinking
                                Fund, which was passed the first reading.
                            Mr. BRANHAM moved that the rales be suspended and the joint
                                resolution be read the second time now.
                            Mr. DAVIS. As the gentleman over the way was getting nearer right
                                now, he hoped the rules could be suspended.
                            The Constitution requiring this vote to be taken by yeas and nays,
                                and the Clerk reporting - yeas 71, nays 19 - two-thirds in the
                                affirmative; the rules were suspended, and the joint resolution was
                                read again and considered on the second reading.
                            Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to strike out and insert "25th day of
                                April."
                            Mr. CLEMENTS resisted the passage of the resolution, because it
                                allowed the Treasurer to check on the School Fund, the Swamp Land
                                Fund, &c., for the payment of the interest on the State
                                debt.
                            Mr. HUNTER said to the gentleman, that all the Swamp Land and all the
                                School Fund had already been taken for the last July instalment of
                                interest. None of these funds were in the Treasury. Did the
                                gentleman propose any other means to pay this interest. If the
                                Governor veto the bill passed yesterday, there would be no
                                alternative but to go at large into the market with new State bonds.
                                This joint resolution was to avoid that, &c.Mr. JONES proposed
                                to amend the amendment, by striking out the words "giving preference
                                to the Sinking Fund."
                            Mr. HARNEY. As it was a case of emergency, he would vote for the
                                joint resolution, but he begged the gentleman, in mercy, not to
                                connect it with the bill passed yesterday.
                            Mr. DAVIS. This joint resolution proposed, first, to make application
                                to the Sinking Fund Commissioners, giving evidence of debt, and
                                paying interest on the money borrowed. But he would have it
                                distinctly understood that he did not vote for it for the reasons
                                given by the gentleman from Monroe, (Mr. Hunter) because, if it were
                                in any way connected with the bill of yesterday, he would record his
                                vote against it at all hazards.
                            Mr PARRETT. Taking the resolution as a secondary evil, he was willing
                                to go for it. On his motion the amendments were laid on the
                                table.
                            On his further motion, the joint resolution was ordered to be
                                engrossed, and the rules being suspended - yeas 70, nays 23 - it was
                                considered as engrossed on the third and last reading.
                            Mr. DOBBINS regarded the joint resolution as twin sister to the bill
                                of yesterday. It had many objectionable features. He would never
                                appear against paying the public debt, but the proposition must
                                proceed upon just principles, &c.
                            Mr. HARNEY. We had, in debate here, raised doubt about the Governor,
                                Treasurer and Auditor's authority to loan, and o rendering it,
                                perhaps, impossible for them to do so. It was imperative that this
                                money should be provided, to prevent consequences like the throwing
                                back upon the State of the Wabash and Erie Canal, &c. He would
                                therefore support the resolution.
                            Mr. SMITH, of Perry. This was an emergency It was absolutely
                                necessary that we should show to the holders of the State bonds that
                                we will paywill put them in statue quo. We propose
                                to give security to the Sinking Fund, and to throw upon the State
                                officers the responsibility of the discretion whether to use money
                                in the hands of the Sinking Fund Commissioners or not. If they take
                                the Sinking Fund they will give seven per cent. for money that is
                                now drawing only four per cent,
                                interest. It was by some supposed, that if we do not take this money
                                out of the Sinking Fund, it will be loaned through the several
                                counties in small sums of $50). He would be allowed to say that only
                                a small amount of the fund would be thus loaned. The Commissioners
                                would be obliged to reserve this money for the purpose of retiring
                                the bank bonds; and in the mean time it would be deposited perhaps
                                with Winslow, Lanier & Co., at only four per cent., whilst it
                                was proposed here to give seven per cent.
                            Another thing. The resolution referred to the bonds in the hands of
                                the State officers. These bonds in their hands uncanceled by the
                                Auditor's indorsement, could go into the market and money could be
                                drawn on them, it was thought, without further authority. In this
                                way, if the Sinking Fund Commissioners should not choose to loan to
                                the State for three, six or eighteen months, or two years, the
                                officers of State could negotiate these bonds in the hands ol the
                                fund Commissioners, and so make ample provision for the interest
                                money.
                            [A Senate message now announced the passage in that body of a bill
                                    (S. 86) to enable the
                                holder of unauthorized paper currency to collect the amount
                                thereof.]
                            Mr. STILES demanded the previous question, and under its force the
                                vote was urged upon the main question, viz: the passage of the joint
                                resolution, resulting - yeas 62, nays 35 - as follows:

                            Mr. GRIFFIN explained his vote. There were $18,000 of the Swamp Land
                                Fund due to the ditches in his county, and by this resolution it was
                                proposed to divert this money to other purposes. Therefore he voted
                                against it.

                                On motion by Mr. HUNTER, (the orders being further suspended for
                                    the purpose,) the bill (S.

                                    currency, to collect the amount thereof was taken up and passed
                                    the first reading.
                                On his further motion; (the constitutional provision being
                                    suspended by yeas 94, nays 0,) the bill was passed the second

                                Mr. BLYTHE proposed to amend the bill by adding to the 4th
                                    section, these words:
                                Provided however, if any such bill, note or promise to piy, as
                                    described in the act, shall be lost or destroyed, or shall be in
                                    the possession of the person, company or corporation, who issued
                                    the same, any such person, company or corporation not having
                                    redeemed the same, it may be sued upon as a lost instrument, and

                                On motion by Mr. HUNTER, (the rule and constitutional provision
                                    being again suspended - yeas 87, nays 5,) the bill, as amended,
                                    was considered as engrossed, and passed the third and last
                                    reading in the House of Representatives by yeas 96, nays 1.
                            
                            
                                THE PUBLIC PRINTING.
                                Mr. NEWTON, (the orders being further suspended for the purpose,)
                                    from the Special Committee on Public Printing, submitted a
                                    report in writing, reviewing particularly the public printing
                                    and the cost thereof as far back as the year 1854, arid making
                                    sunduy suggestions and rtjcom jnendatious based upon tes:imony
                                    in the investigation and submitted with the report, which was
                                    read at length.
                                The committee recommended the passage of a law suggesting among
                                    others, the following teatures:
                                
                                    A repeal of the statute of 1853, fixing the
                                        compensation of public printer.
                                    The establishing of prices for binding in addition
                                        to those of composition and press-work, folding and
                                        stitching.
                                    That the public printer should furnish his own
                                        paper, and that the same shall in all cases be of a given
                                        weight and according to sample furnished.
                                    Requiring the public printer to keep an exact
                                        account of each item of work done for the State, together
                                        with the number of reams of paper used by him in doing work
                                        for the State.
                                
                                Mr. MILLER explained the report, and reasoned at length in favor
                                    of the report, its suggestions and recommendations - protesting
                                    specially, as a practical printer, against the right of the
                                    public printer to the outside or cassie quires of paper.
                                [A message from the Senate now announced the passage in that body
                                    of the bill (S 109) to prevent the circulating of unauthorized
                                    and broken bank paper, &c.]
                                Mr. BLYTHE moved that the report and testimony be laid on the
                                    table, and that 1,000 copies thereof be printed for the use of
                                    the House of Representatives.
                                Mr. HARNEY would like to know why the committee traveled out ot
                                    their line of investigation to censure the Attorney General,
                                    when there was nothing in the facts to warrant it. The
                                    Superintendent of Public Instruction to excuse himself for
                                    having published certain books ordered by An Act of the
                                    Legislature in 1853, page 126, said that the Attorney General
                                    had given his opinion that it was his duty to do so. That
                                    opinion was given in a private conversation with the
                                    Superintendent, whereupon the committee proceed to censure him
                                    for it. The Attorney General did give an opinion on that
                                    subject, at another time; and any person can see by reading the
                                    act above alluded to, that the opinion was correct; and if the
                                    Superintendent had heretofore failed to comply with it, the
                                    Attorney General certainly could be no way responsible for it,
                                    nor could he make a legal opinion conform to what might have
                                    been explained at the time it was given. Certainly the committee
                                    should give some good reasons for this open censure.
                                Mr. RITTER replied. It was evidently the intention to distribute
                                    documents already printed. Why aid not the Attorney-General tell
                                    them to reprint the Statutes? There was $7,800 audited for
                                    composition and press work of the documentary journal, teprinted
                                    under the Attorney-General's decision.
                                Mr. DAVIS understood that the opimon of the Attorney General was
                                    in writing and on file, and he suggested that it be printed with
                                    this order.
                                Mr. BLYTHE. Such a course might not be the best for the legal
                                    reputation of the Attorney General.
                                Mr. DAVIS. Let him rest upon his own work.
                                Mr. TURPIE called for a division of the question.
                                The first question was on laying the report and testimony on the

                                So the House concurred, and the resolution was adopted.
                                Mr. STILES named Henry S. Lane, of Montgomery county, for the
                                    longest term in the resolution.
                                The SPEAKER directed the Clerk to proceed with the call.
                                Mr. BLYTHE asked and obtained excuse for refusing to answer.
                                Mr. KEEPER asked to be excased, but the House refused.
                                Mr. TURPIE moved to reconsider the vote by which Mr. Blythe was
                                    excused, and proceeded thereupon to reason, that this was no
                                    regular action of the House of Representatives, and there was no
                                    room for excuse. But - 
                                The SPEAKER repressed debate, and the House refused to
                                    reconsider, on a division - affirmative 24, negative 47.
                                The Clerk pursued the roll and reported as follows:

                                Mr. DAVIS, when his name was called, keasd to be excused, because
                                    he did not think there was any officer to elect. But the House
                                    refused.
                                The SPEAKER announced the result: Henry S. Lane having received
                                    the votes of a majority of the members of the House of
                                    Representatives, I declare, on the part of this House, that he
                                    is duly elected a Senator of the United States for the State of
                                    Indiana, to serve till the fourth day of March, 1863. [Great
                                    cheering followed here.]
                                [A Senate message announced that that body had elected Henry S.
                                    Lane and Wm. M. McCarty United States Senators for the State of
                                    Indiana.]
                                Mr. COLLIER nominated William H. McCarty, of Marion County, for
                                    the shortest term in the resolution - the Clerk pursuing the
                                    roll, as before, and with a similar result, except that the
                                    House now refused to excuse Mr. Blythe.
                                Mr. EDWARDS, when his name was called on the McCarty roll, said:
                                    Mr. Speaker, I have voted here that Indiana is not represented
                                    in the Senate of the United States, by persons elected in
                                    pursuance of the Constitution and Laws. I believe I was right
                                    when I gave that vote, and I wish to act upon that principle in
                                    voting now. I would prefer to vote for some gentlemen who
                                    represented my political sentiments nearer than the gentlemen
                                    now nominated - in the belief that my constituents and those of
                                    my friend from Ohio (Mr. Gregory) ought to be entitled to some
                                    respect and a fair representation, I have good reasons for
                                    preferring some one else for this position, but in order that
                                    the gentlemen now nominated may have fifty one votes I will give
                                    him mine.
                                Mr RITTER moved to take up and concur in the Senate message
                                    announcing the result, of the action of that body in its
                                    proceedings under the above resolution.
                                Mr. DAVIS. The action of the two Houses is concurrent, and there
                                    it ends. So it seems to me.
                                The SPEAKER and Mr. RITTER acquiesced
                                Mr. Parrett, Mr. Claypool and Mr. Usrey now had leave of absence
                                    for the remainder of the session after to-morrow.
                            
                            
                                BROKEN BANK PAPER.
                                On the motion of Mr. HUNTER the House now resumed the preceding
                                    order which had been interrupted by the proceedings under the
                                    above resolution of the Senate - to-wit: the consideration of
                                    the bill (S. 109) to. prevent the putting away or circulating of
                                    unauthorized bank paper &c,
                                The Clerk pursued the reading of the bill, and it was passed the
                                    first reading.
                                On motion by Mr HUNTER, the rules being now dispensed with, the
                                    bill was put upon the second reading.
                                Mr. KNOWLTON proposed to amend the bill by striking out the word
                                    "insolvent" wherever it occurs.
                                On motion by Mr. HUNTER, the bill and proposed amendment were
                                    referred to a select committee which the SPEAKER makes to
                                    consist of Messrs. Blythe, Stanfield, Mellett and Davis.

                            COUNTY BOARDS.
                            The bill (H R. 60) to amend sections of an act for the organization

                            SINKING FUND.
                            The bill (H. R. 101 to secure
                                the Sinking Fund debt, coming up, it was read the first time.
                            Mr. WAGNER moved a suspension of rules and that the bill be read by
                                title a second time now.
                            The motion was agreed to by yeas 43, nays 1.
                            Mr. WAGNER explained the provisions of the bill.
                            Mr. STUDABAKER moved a suspension of rules, and that the bill be read
                                the third time now.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON objected.
                            Mr. MURRAY was in favor of the proposition to suspend the rules.
                            Mr. CRAVENS knew this bill was well guarded. It simply proposes that
                                the interest on money borrowed from the Sinking Fund by the State in
                                1842, be put into a bond and surrendered to the Commissioners.
                            Mr. TARKINGTON moved to add the $165,000 borrowed last July.
                            Mr. WAGNER opposed the amendment, and submitted his reasons
                                therefor.
                            Mr. BOBBS was in favor of taking care of this fund, and consequently
                                was of the opinion that the bill should pass.
                            Mr. HEFFREN moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                            The motion was agreed to by yeas 33, nays 7.
                            The motion to suspend the rules and read the bill the third time was
                                agreed to - yeas 38, nays 1.
                            The bill was then finally passed the Senate by yeas 43, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            EXEMPTION OP PROPERTY FROM SALE
                            Mr. McLEAN'S bill (S. 46) to amend section 9 of an act exempting
                                property from sale in certain cases, approved February 17,1852,
                                coming up on the third reading - 
                            Mr. MARCH objected to the passage of the bill.
                            Mr. McLEAN advocated the passage of his bill, and defended it from
                                the objections named against it. The object of the bill is to aid
                                the law now on our statute books.
                            Mr. ANTHONY thought the law too stringent.
                            Mr. GREEN coincided in the views expressed by the Senator from
                                Floyd.[Mr. Anthony.]
                            The bill was then rejected by yeas 15, nays 25.
                        
                        
                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
                            Mr. LINE asked and obtained leave of absence for the Senator from

                                Mr. STUDABAKER moved to lay the appeal on the table.
                                The motion was rejected by yeas 18, nays 22.
                                The PRESIDENT stated his reasons for his decision.
                                The question being, "Shall the decision of the Chair remain as
                                    the judgment of the Senate?"
                                The yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken,
                                    resulted - yeas 18, nays 22.
                                So the decision of the Chair does not stand as the judgment of
                                    the Senate.
                                The question recurring on the adoption of the concurrent
                                    resolution - 
                                The resolution was adopted by yeas 22, nays 18.
                            
                            
                                APPROPRIATION BILL.
                                On motion of Mr. MURRAY, the specific appropriation bill (H. R. 104) for the year
                                    1858, was taken from the table by consent.
                                Mr. MURRAY moved that the Senate recede from its amendments
                                    thereto.
                                The motion was agreed to.
                            
                            
                                ADJOURN.
                                Mr. SLACK moved to adjourn.
                                Mr. WALLACE demanded the yeas and nays on the question.
                                There being a second - 
                                The yeas and nays were demanded, and being taken, resulted - yeas
                                    11, nays 24.
                                So the motion was rejected.
                            
                            
                                BRIGHT AND FITCH.
                                A recount on the passage of Mr. Gooding's joint resolution (S. 6)
                                    was ordered by the Senate with the following result - yeas 26,
                                    nays 1.
                                There being no quorum voting - 
                                The Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                        
                            THURSDAY, December 23, 1858.
                        
                        Mr. Murray moved to dispense for the present with the reading of the
                            Journal, and to take up the concurrent resolution of the Senate to
                            adjourn without day, next Saturday, just now reported by their
                            Secretary.
                        The motion was agreed to, and the resolution was read as follows:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Senate will, the House
                                        concurring therein, adjourn sine die on
                                        Saturday, the 25th instant, at 10 o'clock, A. M.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was concurred in by consent.
                        
                            ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                            Mr. HARNEY rose to make a motion to strike out from the journal of
                                yesterday all that part of the journal which relates to the election
                                of United States Senators. He said:
                            It occurs to me that there is an amendment Heeded to the journal of
                                yesterday. We do not think that the record of a pleasant little
                                episode we perpetrated yesterday should be continued upon the
                                journal as a lasting memorial against us. Many members here have
                                loudly hoped to figure somewhat in the future politics of the
                                country, and do not wish this final record of the folly of this
                                Legislature to exist against them.
                            I recollect, sir, yesterday, the House got excited probably from the
                                fact that some had lately been attending theatrical performances in
                                this city, and concluded (probably on the score of economy) that we
                                would get up a little performance of our own, in which members could
                                play a part, and pursuant to the programme, and under the impulses
                                of the moment, we pretended to elect two United States Senators. And
                                so "last and furious ran the fun," that in the language of the
                                gentleman from Elkhart, "we conservatives had to hold back like a
                                Connestoga team before a loaded vehicle going down hill," represent
                                the House in its imaginary plenitude of power from electing a
                                President of Mexico - a Generalissimo of the army in Abyssinia, and
                                also passing some wholesome laws for the safe keeping and management
                                of the waters of the Atlantic ocean.
                            It often occurs, sir, in human affairs, that persons hitherto
                                obscure, become the exponents of the age in which they live, and
                                trifling events give the times historic fame, or make them look
                                vulgar and ridiculous; and we fear it may be so that the future
                                chronicler in looking out for the salient points in our history as
                                characterictics of the age, may seize upon the events of yesterday
                                and the record of our theatrical performances, as indicating the
                                recklessness, the inconsistency and folly of the men and times in
                                which we live.
                            I move, therefore, that the journal be so corrected as to afford no
                                evidence that this House ever enacted the folly of electing men to
                                fill an office where there was no vacancy.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair is constrained to decide the motion out of
                                order.
                            Mr. HARNEY would appeal to the House from that decision.
                            The SPEAAER. The gentleman will reduce his appeal to writing.
                        
                        
                            ABSENCE.
                            On motion by Mr. DAVIS, Mr. Stanfield, Mr. Cavins, Mr. Dobbins and
                                Mr. Hunter had leave of absence after this day.
                            On motion by Mr DOUGHERTY, Mr. Collier had leave of absence.
                            On motion by Mr. PARRETT, Mr. McLain had leave of absence after this
                                day.
                            Mr. Colgrove, by unanimous consent, was permitted to record on the
                                journal of yesterday, his vote for Lane and McCarty.
                            Mr. Stinson had leave to appear on the journal as present and not
                                voting.
                            
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY asked if it were true that upon going into the
                                Senatorial election yesterday the doors were locked to keep
                                old-liners from bolting, and if so, by what authority?
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair is not informed of any such fact.
                            Mr. DOBBINS. He was informed by the Door-keeper, that the doors were
                                shut, and by the order of the Speaker.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair gave no such direction.
                        
                        
                            SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION BILL.
                            Mr. BRANHAM (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill (No. 104) making specific
                                appropriations for the year 1858, and it was passed to the
                                engrossment under a suspension of the rules.
                            On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the Assistant Clerks of the House were
                                allowed $4 per day, the same as the allowance to the principal.
                            Mr. DAVIS proposed the same compensation for the Door-keeper and his
                                assistants.
                            Mr. MURRAY and Mr. SCOTT voted to raise the pay of the Assistant
                                Clerks to four dollars a day, because this House employed a smaller
                                number then ever before. The labor of the Door-keepers had not been
                                more onerous than usual, and their service was not worth more than
                                that of a member of the House.
                            Mr. DAVIS denied tbat there was any diminuation in the number of
                                clerks, and alleged that there had been additional duties devolved
                                on the Door-keepers, and that their service was not so pleasant as
                                that of the clerks, and required an equal amount of talent. From
                                these considerations he had offered this amendment.
                            [A Senate message now announced the concurrence of that body in the
                                House amendments to the Senate bills 15 and 86.]
                            Mr. POWER supported the amendment from the same considerations.
                            The amendment was rejected by yeas 29, nays 63.
                            Mr. DAVIS now moved to reconsider the vote allowing the Assistant
                                Clerks $4 a day.
                            Mr. KEEFER demanding the yeas and nays, the motion was rejected by
                                yeas 41, nays 49.
                            On motion by Mr. LAWHEAD, the pages and wood sawyers were allowed $2
                                a day.
                            Mr. DOBBINS proposed to Strike out $319 and insert $480, as
                                compensation for the proprietors of the Daily
                                    Sentinel and Daily Journal for their
                                newspapers furnished this House. He understood that $480 was their
                                charge. We desire to have our proceedings reported, and should
                                expect to pay for that service, and pay liberally, so that the
                                proprietors of these papers can afford to hire competent reporters.
                                It was certainly evident to every man on that floor, when he looks
                                at the expense attending the publication of these papers - setting
                                the type, employing the reporters, &c., that $319 was entirely
                                insufficient. He understood that the committee had reduced the
                                charges of these papers from $480 to $319. How , they came to make
                                that reduction he could not say. But for his part he was willing to
                                allow their charge - to pay them liberally so as to justify them in
                                continuing their full reports of proceedings of the Legislature,
                                which were of so much advantage to members as well as to the whole
                                people.
                            Mr. HUNTER. At the commencement of this session he went to the Journal office and inquired what their paper would
                                cost, and was told by the editor that he could afford to furnish the
                                    Journal at three cents per copy, and the
                                committee had made that allowance - three cents for each paper, and
                                one cent for the stamp. This would be $9 a year, and he believed the
                                papers were furnished to subscribers at $6. He had since been told
                                by these proprietors that this was not enough. But a printer in his
                                room last night had said it was ample.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY. The resolution under which the House had taken these
                                papers provided that the Door-keeper should contract for a certain
                                number of copies. He supposed the Door keeper had made a contract;
                                if so, the contract should govern our action.

                            Mr HAMILTON, of Boone, supposed the committee had investigated the
                                matter, and was unwilling to interfere with their conclusions. His
                                own impression was that we were paying as much as would be right. He
                                was unwilling for these editors to make this a matter of
                                speculation.
                            Mr. DAVIS. The Door-keeper had just informed him that he had
                                contracted for these papers at the usual subscription price.
                            Mr. HUNTER. If the Door-keeper had made any agreement, it did not
                                come to the committee. The Legislature ought certainly to stand by
                                its agreement.
                            Mr. DAVIS understood that four cents was the price of these papers to
                                the Legislature heretofore, and that was his understanding of the
                                contract for the paper without the stamps.
                            Mr. SCOTT. If the Door-keeper, by our authority, had entered into a
                                contract, he would be unwilling to back out. The printer should be
                                paid, but he should not be permitted to speculate out of the
                                House.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. The committee knew nothing about any contract. He had
                                been told of the publishers that they had incurred extra expense,
                                and he was for a fair compensation. If there had been a contract, he
                                was for standing to it.
                            Mr. MELLETT understood from the Doorkeeper that he had contracted to
                                pay the usual subscription price.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. But the publishers had incurred additional expense.
                            Mr. SCOTT. It was the Legislative subscription price.
                            Mr. MELLETT did not know by what rule they charged the Legislature
                                more than ordinary subscribers.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. I understand the Doorkeeper agreed to give what had been
                                given heretofore.
                            Mr. MELLETT. Then there was no contract. The Door keeper
                                understanding the price to be one thing and the printers another. He
                                thought the report proposed a sufficient compensation, and this
                                subscription wis an accommodation to the editors of newspapers,
                                because whether we take them or not, they would report our
                                proceedings. Other daily papers maintain reporters here without the
                                consideration of extra copies.
                            
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY said the usual subscription was twelve-and a half cents
                                per week. Four cents per copy would be twenty-four cents per
                                weekdouble the ordinary price. I think three cents a copy would be
                                about right, as the committee have reported.
                            Mr. MILLER had just seen one of the clerks of the Sentinel office, and he declared that the price allowed by
                                the Committee on Ways and Means is too small for
                                several reasons - as having to print extra matter, hire reporters,
                                hire a special messenger to bring down the papers, &c. Now these
                                publishers furnish their subscribers at $6 a year, wrapping and
                                mailing each paper singly - and that was more trouble than the
                                bringing their papers into this House. He thought the allowance was
                                ample. In fact if he were to amend it, instead of $319,he would have
                                it $289. The fact of the Legislature being in session, inducing an
                                extra amount of matter for the paper had nothing to do with price.
                                We were taking the papers at club rates, and therefore we should
                                have a reduction instead of an overcharge. He should vote for the
                                allowance, but it any gentleman would move to reduce it he would
                                vote that way more cheerfully.
                            Mr FORDYCE considered it out of the question to increase this
                                allowance, so long as the editor of the Journal
                                had stated that three cents was sufficient.
                            The amendment was rejected.

                            On motion by Mr. USREY, John Bledsoe was allowed $16 for door-keeper
                                service in the organization of the House of Representatives.
                            On motion by Mr. HUNTER, James R. Bracken, a clerk of the former
                                House of Representatives, was allowed $8 for services in the
                                organization.
                            On motion by Mr. KNOWLTON, $10 wa sallowed for the next week's Weekly American, and $8 for postage to mail the
                                same to members.

                            Mr. MILLER proposed to amend sect on 4, by substituting words to the
                                following effect:
                            SECTION 4. The clerks of committees shall be allowed $3 per day
                                except the Clerk of the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means, and the Clerk of the Special Committee on
                                Printing, who shall be allowed each $4 per day.

                                keeper service in the organization.

                            BOARD OF SINKING FUND COMMISSIONERS.
                            On motion by Mr. HUNTER, (the order of business being suspended for
                                the purpose,) the bill (S.
                                    102) to continue the present Board of Sinking Fund
                                Commissioners till the first Monday in April, 1859, and until their
                                successors be elected and qualified, was taken up and passed the
                                first reading.
                            Mr. HUNTER now moved to suspend the rule and read the second
                                time.
                            Mr. DAVIS was opposed to this legislating men into office - creating
                                an interest on the part of this Board against any action the
                                Legislature may take in reference to the Sinking Fund. Although
                                doubtful of its propriety, he would vote for it if they would strike
                                out the clause providing for their continuance in office after the
                                first Monday in April.
                            Mr. HUNTER rehearsed and defended the provisions of the bill. He
                                would vote to continue the present Board. They were honest men.
                            Mr. DAVIS. These elections should be viva voce. He
                                was not prepared to do indirectly what we have no power to do
                                directly. The House should not place men in opposition to their
                                future action.
                            The vote on suspending the rules, resulted - yeas 57, nays 28 - so
                                two thirds of eighty-five, the whole number voting, the rules were
                                suspended.

                            The bill was then considered on the second reading.
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY expressed his surprise at this opposition, moved that
                                the rules and constutional provision be further suspended, and the
                                bill be read the third time now - and deprecated amendment. We would
                                have no custodian for the Sinking Fund if the bill failed.
                            Mr. TURPIE. Had the gentleman forgot that provision of the
                                Constitution which provides the appointing power?
                            Mr. DOUGHERTY. He understood that the Commissioners office expires by
                                limitation in January.
                            Mr. TURPIE. The Constitution prescribed a viva voce
                                vote.
                            Mr DOUGHERTY. Do we not vote viva voce for the
                                bill?
                            Mr. TURPIE. But there was no alternative as to the men. He showed
                                that the general executive powers were sufficient to supply these
                                Commissioners, if necessary. No emergency could be so great as to
                                justify a violation of the Constitution. The friends and fosterers
                                of this fund had brought forward no measure for its custody.
                            Mr. MELLETT. The gentleman from Floyd would support the bill if they
                                were limited to April.
                            Mr. DAVIS. He would not oppose it.
                            Mr. MELLETT proceeded to criticise the opposition to the bill. The
                                gentleman from White insisted that the Governor had the power to
                                appoint, &c. Had not the Legislature the power to continue these
                                officers? The gentleman objected that we were electing. We were only
                                extending their term. Gentlemen wanted to give the control of this
                                immense fund into the hands of the Governor. He would retain a
                                little power in our own hands.
                            Mr. HAMILTON, of Boone, moved the previous question against this kind
                                of opposition, and there being a second, under its operation, the
                                vote on suspending the rule, resulted - yeas 56, nays 23 - so two
                                thirds of the whole number voting in the affirmative, the rules were
                                suspended, and the bill was considered on the third reading.
                            
                            Mr. BLYTHE proposed to commit the bill to a select committee of five,
                                with instructions to the following effect - alleging that we had no
                                power to legislate men into office, but we may continue the term,
                                and the Constitution will continue the incumbent:
                            Strike out the first section and insert a section simply providing
                                for the continutnce of the office of Sinking Fund Commissioners till
                                the first Monday in April, 1859.
                            The motion was agreed to, and the SPEAKER makes the committee to
                                consist of Messrs. Blythe, Branham, Smith, of Perry, Hunter and

                                            hereby earneastly and solemnly protest against the
                                            action of the majority of said House, had upon the 22d
                                            day of December, 1858; relative to the alleged election
                                            of United States Senators for the State of Indiana. In
                                            our opinion the action of the United States Senate upon
                                            that subject, at the last session thereof, was a
                                            finality. We therefore, refused to participate in said
                                            proceedings, believing the same to be irregular,
                                            unconstitutional and void. For a justification of our
                                            action, we confidently appeal to the history of the
                                            facts in the case, and to our constituency - the people
                                            of Indiana.

                                ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATORS.
                                Mr. HARNEY now submitted his appeal from the decision of the
                                    Chair, taken at the opening of this afternoon Session, in the
                                    following words in writing:
                                WHEREAS, it appears by the journals that an election for United
                                    States Senators took place in the House of Representatives, upon
                                    the 22d day of December, 1858; and, whereas, many members of
                                    this House believe this Legislature have no right or power to
                                    elect such United States Senators, inasmuch as there is now no
                                    vacancy existing, they, therefore, believe that the whole
                                    proceeding in reference to said election was irrelevant, out of
                                    order, and void; and, whereas, a motion being made to strike out
                                    from the journals all that part that relates to the election of
                                    United States Senators, which motion was decided, by the
                                    Speaker, to be out of order; therefore, I, James F. Harney, and
                                    William F. Parrett, do appeal from the said decision of the
                                    Chair to the House.
                                Mr. BOYD, because he regarded the language of this appeal as
                                    discourteous toward the House, moved that it be rejected.
                                
                                Mr. PARRETT, as far as he was connected with the appeal, intended
                                    nothing disrespectful, nor did he think its language liable to
                                    that construction. We do not think it a contempt of Court, if we
                                    ask to have an order erased from the record. We conceive that so
                                    much of the Journal as relates to that matter is void, and ought
                                    not to be there, and we therefore made our motion to strike it
                                    out. There was nothing in this disrespectful to any member of
                                    the House.
                                Mr. BOYD. If we vote against the decision we vote indirectly that
                                    there was no election. They can accomplish everything they
                                    desire in a protest, and then there would be no disrespect.
                                [A Senate message announced the passage of a bill of the House,
                                        No. 62, and also No. 22, with
                                    amendments.
                                Mr. HARNEY disclaimed any intention to cast any dishonorable
                                    reflection on the House or member of the House.
                                Mr. EDWARDS could not under any circumstances vote to reject the
                                    appeal. He would vote to lay on the table or to indefinite
                                    postponely.
                                Mr. BOYD withdrew the motion.
                                Mr. SCOTT moved the indefinite postponement of the appeal.

                                                Parrett, Shockley, Shull, Snyder, Stanley, Sullivan,
                                                Tebbs, Thompson of Madison, Turpie, Usrey, Waterman,
                                                Wheeler and Wood - 34.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. SCOTT moved that the vote be now reconsidered, and then - 
                                On motion by Mr. BRANHAM this motion was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                SWAMP LANDS.
                                On motion by Mr. GRIFFIN, (the orders being suspended,) the bill
                                    (S. 68) to amend 20, 28, 32 and 51st sections, to regulate the
                                    sale of the Swamp Lands, and providing for their draining,
                                    &c., approved May 20, 1852, was taken up, and passed the
                                    first reading.
                                Mr. GRIFFIN moved to suspend the rule and read the second time -
                                    it was a very important bill.
                                Mr. TURPIE.For that reason he should oppose a suspension of the
                                    rule. The House was thin - doubtful whether there was a quorum,
                                    and he committed himself now against all motions to suspend the
                                    rules.
                                Mr. SCOTT hoped the rules would be suspended - stating the object
                                    of this bill to be simply to enable the County Commissioners to
                                    appoint the Swamp Land Commissioners and to look after him and
                                    see that he does not join with others to cheat the State out of
                                    the proceeds of these lands.
                                The vote on the motion to suspend resulted - yeas 47, nays 46 -
                                    so the rule was not suspended.
                            
                            
                                SINKING FUND COMMISSIONERS.
                                Mr. BLYTHE, (the orders being suspended for the purpose,) from
                                    the select committee to which was referred the Senate bill No. 102 to continue the
                                    present Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners, returned the same
                                    with an amendment, proposing to continue said Board and Clerk no
                                    longer than till the first Monday in April, 1859, striking out
                                    the words "until their successors shall be elected and
                                    qualified."
                                The amendment was concurred in.
                                Mr. TURPIE and Mr. DAVIS now signified their readiness to
                                    suppport this bill - as liable to much less objection than any
                                    shape in which it had appeared before.
                                The bill passed the final reading in the House of Representatives
                                    by yeas 79, nays 3, with an amendment of title.
                            
                            
                                PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
                                Mr. COLGROVE rose to a personal explanation, and desired the
                                    Clerk to read from the Cincinnati Commercial
                                    of December 23d, an extract from a letter written by a
                                    correspondent of that paper (Mr. Villard) reflecting upon him
                                    for his absence at the time of the election of United States
                                    Senators, and designating him a bogus Cato in the case,
                                    &c.
                                Ths extract having been read, M. C. continued.
                                I desire to say but a word or two. I hardly feel competent to do
                                    justice to the subject. [Laughter.] My absence yesterday -
                                    stated by the Reporter, as being a matter of revenge on my party
                                    because they had not adopted my views on a certain financial
                                    bill. It is true that I opposed that bill and fought it every
                                    inch of ground it gained from its inception to its final
                                    passage, and with th^ exception of two, I stood here alone
                                    amongst the members of my party in opposing that bill. That
                                    opposition was prompted by an earnest conviction of my mind, and
                                    I would oppose it again under the same circumstances. Probably
                                    every man on this floor knows that, night before last, about
                                    eight o'clock, I received a telegraphic dispatch, informing me
                                    that my brother-in-law had deceased, and I considered it my
                                    imperative duty to go and pay the last tribute of respect to a
                                    departed relative. Then, as for this charge uttered in the
                                    Cincinnati Commercial, by a reporter who
                                    occupied a seat on this floor, conferred upon him with the aid
                                    of my own vote, I am constrained to say it is base and false,
                                    and cowardly, and that the perpetrator of it is unworthy of a
                                    place on this floor, or amongst gen-men anywhere. And, to
                                    conclude, (I ask the Reporters to take notice of this,) I hold
                                    myself responsible for these remarks, not only here, but
                                    elsewhere and always. [Applause.]
                                (A message from the Governor now announced that his Excellency
                                    had approved and signed bills of the Senate, numbered 15 and 86.)
                            
                            
                                ASSETS OF THE STATE BANK OF INDIANA.
                                On motion by Mr. Nebeker, of Warren, (the orders being
                                    suspended,) the bill S,
                                        110) vesting in the assignees of the Branches of the
                                    State Bank of Indiana the right to enforce, in their own name,
                                    the possession and enjoyment of the  assetts so assigned, to have legal
                                    process, to give acquittances in their own name, &c., was
                                    taken up and passed the first reading.
                                On his further motion (the rules being suspended - yeas 76, nays
                                    1) the bill was read the second time by title.
                                Mr. BOYD desired a commitment.
                                Mr. DAVIS. The sole object of the bill was to enable them to go
                                    on and wind up - to make transfers of securities, and enable the
                                    party to whom they are transferred to go on to judgment and
                                    collection.
                                Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren, moved to suspend the rules and read the
                                    bill the third time now, the vote resulting - yeas 60, nays
                                    20.
                                So the bill was read again, and passed the final reading, by yeas
                                    65, nays 12.
                            
                            
                                WARMING THE HALL.
                                Mr. COLLIER, from the Committee on ventilation of the
                                        Hall, reported in favor of hot air brought from
                                    furnaces in the basement, with ventilating registers, afr $475
                                    to $500, and recommended that Mr. Cox put up the furnaces,
                                    &c.
                                The report was concurred in.
                            
                            
                                MR. VILLARD.
                                Mr. JEFFRIES, (by unanimous consent,) submitted the
                                    following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the Reporter for the
                                                Cincinnati Commercial be expelled
                                                from his seat as a Reporter on this floor, for
                                                having prepared and caused to be published a libel
                                                on the honorable Mr. Colgrove a member of this
                                                House.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. STILES. Notice had not been served on this Reporter, and he
                                    was not in court.
                                Mr. JEFFRIES. He characterized the act in mildness, when he
                                    called it base and cowardly.
                                Mr. GREGORY made a statement, to the effect, that Mr. Villard
                                    knew the circumstances under which Mr. Colgrove went away.
                                Mr. MELLETT had no knowledge of any resolution admitting this
                                    Reporter to the floor.
                                Mr. BRANHAM. It might be yet that the Reporter's mind was fairly
                                    impressed that Mr. Colgrove went away offended, &c.
                                After further debate - 
                                Mr. MILLER proposed to amend by substituting these words after
                                    "resolved:"
                                "That the Reporter for the Cincinnati Commercial be hanged--the first day this House has
                                    leisure to do it."
                                The SPEAKER ruled the amendment out of order.
                                Mr. RITTER demanded the previsous question, and under its force
                                    the resolution was adopted on a division - affirmative 29,
                                    negative 23.
                                A Senate message announced the Senate's adherence to their
                                    amendments to the House bill No. 36, and had appointed a
                                    committee of conference thereon.
                                Mr. DAVIS moved for a committee thereon, on the part of the
                                    House, and the SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Davis, Blythe and
                                    Harrison.
                            
                            
                                REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                                Mr. BLYTHE, from the committee on that subject, returned the
                                    Senate bill No. 9, recommending that it be laid on the
                                    table.
                                The report was concurred in.
                                Mr. MILLER, from the special committee on this subject, returned
                                    the bill for the relief of James O'Brien, with a recommendation
                                    that it be laid on the table.
                                The report was concurred in.
                                Mr. PARKS, from the Committee on Rights and
                                        Privileges, returned sundry petitions for a
                                    conventional interest, with the expression of opinion that
                                    legislation on this subject is inexpedient.
                                The report was concurred in.
                                Mr. EDWARDS, from the Committee on Benevolent
                                        Institutions, returned the memorial of Charles T.
                                    Noble, with the expression of opinion, that the petitioner's
                                    complaint is imaginary.

                                                Gordon, Speaker, for the impartial and dignified
                                                manner in which he has discharged the arduous duties
                                                of the chair, and for his untiring efforts to
                                                discharge business.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. BRANHAM proposed to strike out the words "without regard to

                                COMMON PLEAS COURT.
                                Mr. Hunter's bill (H. R. 42) for the reorganization of the Courts
                                    of Common Pleas, coming up with the committee amendments - 
                                On motion by Mr. SCOTT, the subject was laid on the table.
                            
                            
                                SMALL BILLS.
                                Mr. JONES, (by unanimous consent,) gave notice, that at some
                                    early day of the next regular session of the General Assembly,

                                THE SPEAKER'S OYSTERS.
                                The SPEAKER gave notice to members of this House and the officers

                                            Resolved, That Joseph J. Bingham be
                                                directed to print a "broad-side," embracing the

                                                House of Representatives, similar to that printed by
                                                order of the Senate.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The resolution was rejected without a division.
                                Mr. DAVIS submitted that the Speaker be respectfully requested to
                                    invite the pages of the House to his oyster supper tonight.
                                The SPEAKER I have invited all the boys. (Laughter.)

                                            Resolved. That all candidates
                                                before this body have leave of absence till the
                                                regular session. (Applause.)
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The SPEAKER decided the resolution out of order.
                            
                            
                                SINKING FUND COMMISSIONERS.
                                Mr. BRANHAM, from the Committee on free
                                        conference with reference to the disagreeing votes
                                    of the two Houses upon the select committee's amendment to the
                                    bill (S. 102) continuing
                                    the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners till the first Monday in
                                    April, 1859, reported a recommendation that the House recede
                                    from their amendment.
                                Mr. DAVIS stated that he had not concurred in the report of the
                                    conference committee. He still regarded the bill as a violation
                                    of the State constitution.
                                Mr. HUNTER. A majority of the conference committee were satisfied
                                    that the bill is not unconstitutional, and somo of the best
                                    lawyers in the State concurred with them.
                                Mr. BLYTHE was well satisfied that the bill, as it came from the
                                    Senate, was unconstitutional, and for that reason he could not
                                    vote for it.
                                Mr. TURPIE demanded the yeas and nays on the question of
                                    concurrence in the report, which were ordered, and the vote
                                    resulted - yeas 43, nays 32.
                                Mr. DAVIS made the point, whether less than a majority of the
                                    whole House could concur.
                                The SPEAKER decided that a majority of the members voting could
                                    concur. It was not as in the case of the passage of a bill.
                                Mr. TURPIE, believing from the vote just taken that the bill
                                    could not receive the constitutional vote, and desiring to make
                                    the test, moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill (S. 102) was passed the
                                    third reading in the House of Representatives.
                                The SPEAKER ruled the motion out of order, the bill having passed
                                    from the possession of the House.
                            
                            
                                THE REPORTERS.
                                Mr. DOBBINS submitted the following, which was adopted by
                                    unanimous consent:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, That the members of the
                                                House of Representatives return thanks to the
                                                Reporters for the Indiana State Sentinel and the Iniana State Journal for the faithful manner in which
                                                they have discharged their duties as Reporters on
                                                this floor.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                The House then took a recess till seven o'clock P. M.
                            
                        
                        
                            NIGHT SESSION.
                            A message from the Senate by Mr. Vawter, their Secretary, announced
                                that that body had passed the bill (H. R. 104 making specific appropriations, with sundry
                                amendments.

                            
                                PRINTING THE LAWS AND JOURNALS.
                                Mr HUNTER submitted the following:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Resolved, by the House of
                                                Represenatives, (the Senate concurring,) That the
                                                laws of this session, as well as the journals
                                                thereof, be not published till the next regular
                                                session, and that they then be published with the
                                                laws and journals of the regular session.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. DOUGHERTY suggested that we have no control over this matter.
                                    It is governed by a law now in force. He moved to lay the
                                    resolution on the table, but withdrew for - 
                                Mr. HARNEY, who would like to have the reasons why the journals
                                    of these two sessions should be bound together.
                                Mr. HUNTER. The next session would probably be a short one, and
                                    every gentleman understood that the binding would be material,
                                    and there would be a saving in the index, &c.
                                Mr. CLEMENTS. We Had passed laws of importance to the people of
                                    the State, without emergency clauses, and if they were not to go
                                    to the people till next year, what was the use of this special
                                    session? The extra expense of binding and distribution ought not
                                    to weigh against the publication of the laws. He knew where this
                                    proposition come from. There was a Democratic State Printer in
                                    office now, and the presumption with some is, that at the next
                                    session there will be a Republican State Printer, and that he
                                    will get this job. ("Consent" - "is that why you object to the
                                    resolution?") No sir; I object because, if these laws we have
                                    passed are worth anvthing they ought to be put in force.
                                Mr. COLGROVE was in favor of the resolution as a matter of
                                    economy in the items mentioned by Mr. Hunter. These items would
                                    amount to about $3,000. Then he frankly acknowledged that he did
                                    not want the present State Printer to have the job.
                                Mr. DOBBINS replied to this reasoning.
                                Mr. HUNTBR had proposed the resolution with a single regard to
                                    economy.
                                Mr. NEBEKER, of Warren, moved the previous question, which, after
                                    a call of the House, demanded by Mr. KEEFER, forced the question
                                    on the adoption of the resolution, resulting - yeas 44, nays 31

                                was referred Mr. Wallace's bill (S. 10) providing for an assignment
                                for the benefit of creditors, reported the same back, recommending
                                that it be laid on the table, with leave for the mover to withdraw
                                the same if he desire.
                            The report was concurred in by consent.

                            AFTERNOON SESSION.
                            Mr. STEVENS, from the Committee on Printing, to
                                which was referred Mr. Heffren's bill (S 37) providing for the
                                letting out of State printing to the lowest responsible bidder,
                                reported that the committee had not time to consider the subject,
                                and recommended that the bill lie on the table.
                            The report was concurred in by consent.

                            
                                SECRETARY OF STATE.
                                Mr.STEVENS, from the same committee, to which was referred a
                                    communication from the Secretary of State, in reply to a
                                    resolution of the Senate, that he be requested to communicate to
                                    the Senate by what authority his predecessor in office had
                                    printed in his last report certain statistiscal  matter, and the cost of printing
                                    thereof, reported the same back, and recommended that it lie on
                                    the table.
                                The report was concurred in by consent.
                            
                            
                                QUALIFICATION OF VOTERS.
                                Mr. MARCH, from the Judiciary Committee, to
                                    which was referred Mr. Cooper's bill (S. 17) prescribing the
                                    qualifications of voters, reported the same back, and
                                    recommended that it lie on the table, with leave to withdraw the
                                    same it he should desire.
                                The report was concurred in by consent,
                            
                            
                                CIRCUIT COURTS.
                                Mr. MARCH offered a resolution to the effect that:
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            WHEREAS, It appears from the Journal of the Senate,
                                                and the Journal of the House of Representatives that
                                                the bill (H. R. 36) to amend section 1 of an act
                                                providing for extending the terms of Circuit Courts
                                                by adjournment, &c., approved February 12, 1855,
                                                to authorize the Court or Judge to hold special
                                                terms, and providing compensation to the Judge and
                                                Prosecuting Attorneys in attendance upon the same,
                                                never finally passed the Senate, therefor - 
                                            Be it resolved That in the opinion
                                                of the Senate said act entitled as above, is null
                                                and void, and has no binding force as a law of the
                                                land.
                                        
                                    
                                
                                Mr. MARCH said that by some mistake this bill had been reported
                                    from the Governor as a law of the land; but that in his opinion
                                    it had no force. It seems to me, continued Mr. M., there can be
                                    no question but that the courts would have the right upon proper
                                    issue to inspect the journals of both Houses. I have inspected
                                    them, and it is a fact the journal of the Senate shows that the
                                    bill has never finally passed this body, and yet by some
                                    mistake, though not a mistake on the part of anybody in this
                                    part of the Capitol, in good faith on the part of the Governor,
                                    the bill has been signed by him, by the Speaker and Clerk of the
                                    House of Representatives, and as your honor [the President,] and
                                    the Secretary of the Senate had a right to do, it was signed by
                                    you and him and sent to the Governor, where it received his
                                    signature as I have before said.
                                The history of the matter is simply this: This bill passed the
                                    House of Representatives, was reported to the Senate, referred
                                    to the Committee on the Judiciary, and by the
                                        Judiciary Committee reported back to the
                                    Senate with three amendments. The report of the committee was
                                    concurred in by the Senate - that is probabiy within the
                                    knowledge of every Senator present. It was then sent to the
                                    House, the House refused to confer in the Senate amendments, and
                                    it was so reported here. The Senate refused to recede, and there
                                    was a committee of conference then appointed. That committee met
                                    and they agreed upon a modification of the bill. They agreed
                                    that the judge should try criminal cases at these special terms,
                                    and be allowed $5 per day, to be paid out of the county treasury
                                    on the order of the Board of County Commissioners; and appointed
                                    Mr. Davis, who was chairman of the committee on the part of the
                                    House, to draw up a report which should be presented to both
                                    Houses. That report has never been presented to the committee of
                                    free conference on the part of the Senate, and consequently the
                                    Senate has never taken any further action thereon. It is evident
                                    to every one that the House could take no action without
                                    concurrent action on the part of the Senate.
                                The object of my resolution is not to intercept, but considering
                                    that this act possesses no force as a law, and yet going forth
                                    into the world in the form of a law, parties may be deceived by
                                    it, for if the law is a nullity any trial taking place under it
                                    would be a nullity; so I propose this resolution as a notice to
                                    the world, that no parties may attempt to take any legal action
                                    under it, and not supposing that we can intercept the validity
                                    of this act as a law if it has any.
                                Mr. CRAVENS would like to know if the report of the
                                        committee on free conference was agreed
                                    to on the part of the House of Representatives.
                                Mr. MARCH. Whether it was agreed to or not, we would have to
                                    concur before the bill could become a law.
                                The resolution was adopted by consent.
                                And then the Senate adjourned.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIFES.
                        
                            FRIDAY, December 24, 1858.
                        
                        Mr. BLYTHE moved that the reading of the Journal be dispensed with.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        
                            FROM THE GOVERNOR.
                            A message from the Governor announced that he had approved and signed
                                Mr. Davis' bill (H. R 36) to amend section 1 of an act providing for
                                extending the terms of Circuit Courts by adjournment, when the
                                pending business shall be unfinished, approved February 12, 1855, to
                                authorize the Judge to call special terms and to fix the
                                compensation of Judge and Prosecuting Attorneys in attendance upon
                                the same.
                            Also, the bill (H. R. 104
                                making specific appropriations for the year 1858.
                        
                        
                            FROM THE SENATE.
                            A message from the Senate announced the concurrence of that body in
                                the resolution of the House providing that the laws and acts of this
                                session shall not be published until after the next regular session
                                of the Legislature.
                        
                        
                            PROTEST.
                            Mr. BOYD submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            MR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF
                                                REPRESENTATVES:
                                        
                                        We, the undersigned, members of this House not having an
                                            opportunity to investigate the matters generally
                                            contained in the Specific Appropriation Bill, just
                                            passed by this House and having sufficient reason for
                                            believing as we do, that that part of said bill relating
                                            to the "Bank Fraud Investigation" contains accounts, if
                                            not unjust, they are at least excessive in amount, and
                                            should not have been sanctioned and legalized by the
                                            action of this House, without an opportunity afforded
                                            its members to give it the requisite investigation. For
                                            such reason, we do hereby enter our protest to the
                                            recent action of this House, in, reference to the
                                            passage of that bill.

                                        Other reasons exist also for the above protest.
                                        
                                            W.K.EDWARDS.

                            Ten or fifteen minutes thereafter, no motion having been made, and no
                                business coming up for consideration - there being many and repeated
                                calls for a "farewell address" from the Speakated
                            Mr. Speaker GORDON indulged in a few humorous remarks for the
                                especial benefit erw gratification of those around him; and when and
                                he had concluded -

                        IN SENATE.
                        
                            SATURDAY, December 25, 1858.
                        
                        The Journal of yesterday was read and approved.
                        
                            FROM THE HOUSE.
                            A message was received from the House of Representatives, announcing
                                the passage by that body of the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of three be
                                            appointed on the part of the House to act with a similar
                                            committee on the part of the Senate, to wait upon his
                                            Excellency the Governor, and inform him that the General
                                            Assembly has agreed to adjourn sine
                                                die, unless he has some further comunication to
                                            make; that the Senate be informed of the adoption of
                                            this resolution, and that Messrs. Austin, Turpie and
                                            Boxley, have been appointed said committee.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            EXPLANATION.
                            Mr. GOODING called the attention of the Senate to a paragraph copied
                                into this morning's Sentinel from the New Albany
                                    Ledger, headed "Douglas Deserted." He read the
                                article, and insisted that there was no truth in the statement
                                therein that a resolution was introduced by him indorsing the course
                                of Senator Douglas. The resolution referred to in the article as
                                approving ol the course of Senator Douglas, was, in truth, that one
                                which simply disapproved of the course of Messrs. Bright and Fitch
                                on the question of removing Mr. Douglas from the Chairmanship of the
                                    Committee on Territories. The Senator [Mr.
                                Gooding] then indulged in extended remarks, defending himself from
                                the attacks of newspapers generally, and dealing rather severely
                                with several editors and United States Senators in particular.
                                Before he was half through, he was interrupted by - 
                            The PRESIDENT, who said: Will the Senator give way long enough to
                                allow the Senate to take from the table and dispose of the message
                                from the House of Representatives?
                            Mr. GOODING. Certainly, sir.
                        
                        
                            COMMITTEE TO WAIT UPON THE GOVERNOR.
                            The Secretary then read the resolution from the House, as printed
                                above.
                            The Senate concurred in the resolution by unanimous consent, and the
                                President makes the committee on the part of the Senate to consist
                                of Messrs March, Cravens and McClure.
                            By unanimous consent this committee had leave of absence to perform
                                the duty thus devolved upon them.
                            Mr. GOODING continued, in explanation. He would show by his votes and
                                acts in the Senate that no man on this floor will dare go farther
                                than he in the advocacy and support of Mr. Douglas on every question
                                that involves pure Democratic principles. When he had concluded - 
                            Mr. MARCH, from the committee appointed to wait upon the Governor,
                                and inform him that the Senate was ready to adjourn unless he had
                                some further communication to make, reported that the committee have
                                discharged that duty, and the Governor has no further communication
                                for this Legislature, but to wish us all a merry Christmas.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.
                            Mr. CRAVENS moved that the Secretary be directed to inform the House
                                of Representatives that this body is now ready to adjourn.
                            The motion was agreed to by consent.
                        
                        
                            LEGISLATIVE SENTINEL.
                            Mr. MARCH offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Secretary ot the
                                            Senate be authorized to have one hundred and fifty
                                            copies of the Legislative Sentinel
                                            bound in a cheap binding for the use of the Senate, the
                                            price to be agreed upon in advance.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            FROM THE HOUSE.
                            A message was received from the House of Representatives, announcing
                                the passage by the House of the following resolution:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the House is now ready,
                                            the Senale concurring, to adjourn until the next regular
                                            session.
                                    
                                
                            
                            On motion by Mr. CRAVENS, the message was taken from the table, the
                                resolution concurred in, and the Secretary instructed to inform the
                                House of the concurrence of the Senate in the same.
                        
                        
                            VALEDICTORY.
                            The PRESIDENT. The time has now arrived in which it is made my duty
                                to adjourn the present session of the Legislature. Before I perform
                                that duty I do not propose to make an address, but simply to say
                                that for the kind aid which I have reeeived upon the part of all
                                Senators in the way of assisting me in the discharge of the duties
                                of the Chair, I return you individually and collectively my sincere
                                thanks. I have endeavored since occupying this Chair, as far as my
                                acts have been connected with the Senate is concerned, to act
                                impartially toward all Senators. f have not, to my knowledge, known
                                any difference between any Senator upon this floor. It is true some
                                questions of a party character have arisen upon which I have acted
                                with the political party to which I belong, but as far as the rights
                                of Senators are concerned I have known no distinctions, I have made
                                none in reference to them, and I have given no preference to my
                                political friends over those in the opposition. Saying this much I
                                shall not trouble you by taxing your patience any longer. I now
                                pronounce this special session adjourned without date.
                            And thus the Senate adjourned sine die.

                                            appointed on the part of the House, to act with a

                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            A MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
                            A message from the Senate, by James H. Vawter, principal Secretary

                                        Resolved, That the House is now ready,
                                            the Senate concurring, to adjourn until the next regular

                            VALEDICTORY.
                            Mr. Speaker GORDON
                            GENTLEMEN:These vacant seats inform the few of us who still remain,
                                that the hour of separation for us also has arrived. They are
                                prophetic, likewise, of another separation, when not only our seats
                                here, but the pleasant places we have filled in life, will be seen
                                as time passes, by the few, and ever fewer, survivors of the hundred
                                who convened in this Hall at the commencement of this session,
                                vacant as now are the places of our departed brethren upon this
                                floor. In this admonition, profounder and more interesting by far
                                than the lesson of sense which suggests it, let us all learn to be
                                charitable in our construction of each others motives, purposes and
                                actions. No; I will not say that; it does not become me; for I have
                                lived upon your charitable forbearance and indulgence ever since I
                                have occupied this Chair. Charity and forgiveness are to you
                                habitual and easy, as light to the sun. Had it been otherwise, I
                                should have failed even tolerably to have performed the duties
                                devolved upon me by your choice of me as the presiding officer of
                                the House. With your support and confidence, however, always
                                extended to me, and for which my gratitude is the only return I can
                                offer, I do not feel that I have altogether failed. I know I have
                                committed many errors - some of haste, and others of inexperience
                                none, I am sure, of intention; but all, whether of haste, or
                                inexperience, have been attributed by you to the right quarter, and
                                kindly overlooked and generously forgiven.
                            I find in my heart no cause of hard feeling toward any gentleman of
                                the House for any word spoken or action done toward me during the
                                session. Hard feelings, if any have arisen, existed but for a
                                moment, and were consigned to forgetfulness in the same place and
                                instant in which they originated. As I have forgiven, I ask to be
                                forgiven by you all for whatever I have done amiss, or you have so
                                regarded.
                            The special session is now a matter of history. Its results - whether
                                for good or evil - can not be canceled. Our record is made up -
                                complete. I do not desire to amend it. By it, the candid and fair of
                                all parties will judge us candidly and fairly. We ought to be
                                willing to abide that judgment; and we can brook the judgment of all
                                others, no matter what that judgment may be. One thing I am sure
                                must be accorded to this session by all, namely - it
                                    has not been a failure. No session of the General Assembly
                                in my recollection, and I have attended many in some capacity -
                                during the same number of days has accomplished more, by way of
                                investigation, initiation and completion. The only regret which I
                                entertain, in reference to our labors is, that they could not have
                                been protracted for a few days longer. Twenty-five days added to
                                this session, and the people could have dispensed with the regular
                                session,for all necessary legislation would have been done.
                            A bill introduced by the gentleman from Decatur, to
                                continue the business of this, to the next regular session; and
                                providing for taking it up where we now leave it, would have
                                affected that desirable object as well. Clearly constitutional and
                                proper, it is a matter of profound regret to every economical man,
                                that it failed by reason of the constitutional scruples of some of
                                the members. Its passage would have saved the people much money, and
                                as much labor. It is not possible now to remedy the results that its
                                failure to pass will entail upon this body at its next session,
                                except by returning at its commencement, with the same spirit and
                                energy, and patriotic devotion to the interests of the State and
                                country at large, which you have so signally manifested during that
                                which now closes. May you all then return,and - but I need not add -
                                    so return, to this theater of your labors, and
                                honors.
                            
                            It now only remains for me to discharge the last duty devolved upon
                                me by your election and the Constitution - to pronounce the word
                                FAREWELL!
                             - "a word that hath been and must be, A sound that makes us
                                linger - Yet farewell!"
                            And thus the House adjourned.

                THE PUBLIC FINANCES.
                Remarks of Mr. Smith of Perry,
                Delivered in the House of Representatives of the Indiana Legislature,
                    December 21, 1858. The question being on the reconsideration of the vote of
                    Saturday, by which his bill (H. R. 98) was recommitted to the Committee
                        on Ways and Means.
                Mr. SMITH said:
                
                    MR. SPEAKER - The House is, at this hour, impatient to adjourn; there is an
                        urgent necessity that definite action should be had on this bill prior to
                        adjournment; and there is barely time for me to state a few of the many
                        facts which have not, thus far, been brought fully to your notice in this
                        debate, and which should be considered before a final decision is made on
                        the measures proposed by the Committee of Ways and Means.
                        Yet, as I was the first to suggest the outlines of what is termed, by the
                        gentleman from Floyd, the Omnibus Bill; as the cries of office, bank,
                        plunder have been raised here and elsewhere, and as my motives and objects
                        have been brought in question, I must crave a few moments while I state why
                        I came here, and what I most desire should be accomplished by this
                        Legislature.
                    Ten years ago, and when residing in another State, I came here and asked the
                        legal rights to associate labor and capital, in mining and manufacturing in
                        the county of Perry. As the objects in view were evidently for the public,
                        as for individual benefit, my requests were complied with. With the most
                        liberal charters that the Legislature could grant, I endeavored, by pen and
                        speech, at home and abroad, to bring energy, skill, and capital into the
                        mineral district of this State. These efforts have, directly and indirectly,
                        already resulted in adding some two millions of capital, and probably six
                        thousand people to the wealth of Indiana. This capital is not only fixed,
                        but is eminently reproductive, and these people are most industriously and
                        profitably employed.
                    These enterprises were beginning to attract large attention, and many more
                        millions of capital, and many more thousands of emigrants were in prospect,
                        when defalcations among public officers seemed to become epidemical and
                        taxation in city and country was brought prominently into notice. In answer
                        to the invitations we gave to foreign money and labor, we were questioned as
                        to the condition of our treasury; of our indebtedness and of the per centage
                        we paid for the protection of government, and of the guards that surrounded
                        our credit. Investigation soon made it clear to us that we were paying twice
                        as much tax as there was any necessity for; that our neighbor Kentucky, with
                        a peculiar institution not regarded as favorable to progress and
                        manufacturing industry, with less population and less real wealth, with
                        about the same nominal assets and liabilities, paid an average of only about
                        forty cents on the $100, while we paid over ninety cents, and were, perhaps,
                        not as much benefitted by the tax-gatherer as were our neighbors across the
                        river. In the comparison of the official financial reports of the two
                        States, one set appeared clear and the other confused. The one could be
                        understood by any person of common education, while the other was almost
                        unintelligible to an expert. The credit of the one State was hedged in by so
                        many barriers that a fraudulent use of it seemed impracticable; while, in
                        the other, a single agent - nay, even a clerk selected by an agent, had the
                        power of involving the State to an amount only limited by its credit and the
                        capital seeking investment in public stocks.
                    No tax-payer in the State could venture to affirm that the actual liabilities
                        of Indiana were not seventy or any number of millions of dollars, instead of
                        the seven and a half millions, as reported by the Auditor. In such a
                        condition of things, how could we ask capital or labor? We might bear the
                        ills we have, in respect to taxation, but could we expect our friends abroad
                        to trust themselves and their means within the unguarded power of
                        irresponsible and distant agents, and agent's clerks? Banking capital can be
                        transferred, almost by a check, from a point of danger to one of safety; but
                        a capital invested in mines and mills is fixed and immovable.
                    To effect, if possible, a reduction of taxes; the introduction of more
                        simplicity and system into the methods of keeping and reporting our public
                        accounts; and more than all, to throw efficient safeguards around our State
                        credit, now wholly in trust of a stranger clerk in New York, was the motive,
                        and the only motive, which brought me here. The gentleman from Floyd sees
                        the State Bank behind my financial proposition. He might have known that, in
                        my section of the State, there has ever been a decided opposition to banks.
                        We have never received favors or advantages of any kind, either from the old
                        or the the new State Bank. We required more or less bank accommodations, and
                        we had to seek them in Kentucky and Massachusetts. We prefer a sub-treasury,
                        and gold and silver to bank notes. As to office, and the influence that the
                        hope of office might have had in moulding the features of this bill, I have
                        this to say - that Indiana has no office within its gift that I would now
                        accept.
                    You, Mr. Speaker, had the kindness to place me on the Committee of
                            Ways and Means. I found in its Chairman, a gentleman of as
                        clear a head and of a purpose as straight forward in the line of duty as
                        anyone with whom I have ever been associated. He had the same objects in
                        view, and the other gentlemen on the committee were ready to  discharge their duty to the State irrespective
                        of party. With one consent we agreed to throw party spirit to the winds in
                        all our deliberations in reference to the financial measures to be proposed.
                        Although a Democrat and perhaps an ultra Democrat and in the minority, yet,
                        as I had been engaged in business many years and was somewhat familiar with
                        extensive money transactions, it was suggested that I should examine the
                        condition of our finances and elaborate some plan of relief from present
                        embarrassments. This onerous task was accepted with full knowledge of the
                        difficulties attending its accomplishment. The first thing to be done was to
                        search for available assetts in the Treasury. A further examination there
                        developed the fact that $84,500 of "unavailable cash" had swelled to
                        $113,000, and that we should have to guess at the amount which was really
                        available. It was clear, however, that $100,000 would be wanted to pay the
                        January interest and beyond what the Treasurer could furnish. That sum could
                        have been had at one or more of our bank, yet to the inconvenience of the
                        people; besides, it was not deemed desirable to put the State under any
                        obligation to any bank or set of banks, that were subject to our State
                        supervision. A new issue of bonds to pay the interest on those already
                        issued and for current expenses seemed not only disgraceful, but also
                        attended with some cost and infinite danger. The great debt which now weighs
                        down our energies and which was reduced to seven and a half millions of
                        dollars by a compromise of equivocal honesty, was contracted when our State
                        borrowed because it could borrow with so much ease. The money borrowed begat
                        extravagance, supported political prostitutes, and resulted in scarcely any
                        permanent good to the State. The history of every funded debt we have
                        created admonishes us to beware how we create another. From an examination
                        of a Treasury where everything was in confusion; where acceptances of the
                        Treasurer were charged, and bills receivable were credited as cash; of an
                        Auditor's office where the books were , closed every official year without
                        even the form of a "trial balance" - of the office of the "State debt
                        Sinking Fund" which had been six years in operation without giving a single
                        report as directed by the law, and where from $'25,000 to $40,000 had been
                        allowed to accumulate, apparently for the sole use of its custodian,
                        recourse was had to the office of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fundthere
                        every paper and account and balance called for was simple, full and
                        intelligible. The eath there was evidently cash, and available cashof this
                        there was quite enough to supply the present wants of the State. This was in
                        readiness for the purchase of the securities of Indiana, the "Bank Bonds,"
                        now amounting to over $900,000 and payable in 1864-5-6, having the
                        preference. Such was the credit of the securities in this fund, and of its
                        management that, although these bonds bore only 5 per cent, interest, their
                        holders would not part with them under par. The line of policy very properly
                        pursued by those Commissioners was to invest in the 5 per cent, certificates
                        of the State debt at a discount from the face of even 20 or 15 per cent; but
                        as every person familiar with financial affairs well understands, the
                        present is not the time to buy publicsecurities to advantage. The supply is
                        less than the demand. Within the next two years, when business shall have
                        become more active and speculations become rife, money will be again in
                        demand - will command a higher rate of interest, and these securities will
                        then fall, and can be bought to advantage by our Commissioners. In the
                        meantime they will act wisely in making short investments even at a low rate
                        of interest. Here was a sum ample for our present wants, and, by its use for
                        a short time, the State would escape the disgrace of borrowing abroad to pay
                        interest on a foreign debt, and would be enlarging a fund in which we all
                        feel so great an interest. The money wanted being here, the economical
                        method of opening an account with its holders and pacing interest on its use
                        only while we needed it, was obviously expedient. Here, then, seemed to be a
                        safe point at which to commence. We could use every dollar of our own money
                        that we could get hold of, and borrow the deficiency until our floating
                        assets could be realized and new taxes could be collected. The first bill
                        was drawn up in reference chiefly to these two objects. It met the unanimous
                        approval of the committee, and was satisfactory to the officersfof the
                        Sinking Fund. The leading members of this House, irrespective of party, were
                        then advised of the leading features of the plan, which met, as we supposed?
                        with great favor. The gentleman from Floyd, however, and other eminent
                        civilians in the House, expressed the opinion that, as a condition
                        precedent, the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners, whose official term
                        expired on the first of January next, must be reorganized. In deference to
                        their opinion, the first twelve sections of our bill were added - then, to
                        meet the views of those especially interested in the School Fund, the Swamp
                        Land Fund, and in the respectable support of the Treasurer, other sections
                        were added. The penal section was, in the opinion of all, absolutely
                        necessary to satisfy the public mind.
                    Well, we are now complained of that our system is too complicated, and by the
                        very gentlemen whose advice we followed. Still more strange - other
                        gentlemen oppose us because we have not embraced in our bill whatever could
                        pertain to the proper management of our treasury. Many of my Democratic
                        friends cannot now support the bill, because it does not include a
                        sub-treasury, as though a sub-treasury was a matter of instant necessity,
                        when not a dollar can be had to put into one if we had it, and as though
                        there was a talisman in the very name that would open some cave of treasure
                        from which we could pay our January creditors.
                    But, Mr. Speaker, it is said that we have designs on the school fund, and the
                        children, present and prospective, of the gentlemen from Floyd and Elkhart
                        have been marshaled before us with most touchng remonstrances. Let the
                        gentlemen point to a solitary proposition made before this, in either branch
                        of the Legislature, for the return to this fund of the money taken from it
                        by the State, during the last seventeen years. The gentlemen from Floyd and
                        Randolph have occupied seats here in times past, and when the treasury was
                        not bankrupt. What law have they proposed  for the benefit of the children of the State?
                        Our bill asssigns the revenue; or, in other terms, pledges the real and
                        personal property of every tax-payer in the State, for the repayment of
                        these sums borrowed and to be borrowed. We have used the strongest and most
                        explicit words within our knowledge to effect this purpose, and we have said
                        to the member from Randolph, that if he was not content with words, he might
                        make up the account current, principal and interest, and we would insert the
                        sum total in figures.
                    But, it is said that the bill proposes to increase the number of officers -
                        that it makes five Treasurers instead of one. It does no such thing. It does
                        not create the necessity for a single clerk or hireling beyond what are now
                        employed. If anything, it lessens the labor of managing the public funds,
                        for the Treasurer would have but one place of deposit, (and that a safe
                        one,) instead of ten or twenty, and those more or less unsafe - unknown to
                        the law, and suspected by the people.
                    At this late hour, Sir, I can not do more than give the briefest remarks on
                        the general features of this bill, or rather on the first bill, of which
                        this before us is a constituent part; yet I can not take my seat without
                        doing justice to the officers of the Sinking Fund, who have, it seems, been
                        exposed to undeserved censure by the measures I have proposed. It has been
                        intimated here, and said more openly outside our bar, and not only in speech
                        but in print, that these officers are anything but immaculate; that they, as
                        well as other public officers, have used the public money for their own
                        purposes, or have pocketed the premiums and interest on loans and deposits,
                        and that they are at the bottom of this financial scheme. Now, Sir, I have
                        before stated that, at first, these officers were opposed to the plan uuder
                        consideration, and did not approve it until it was evident that no other
                        safe plan could be devised to meet the present emergency. I have also stated
                        that I had scarcely a passing acquaintance with any member of this Board, or
                        any of the employees, except the Clerk; that, as a member of the committee,
                        I applied to this, as to the other public officers, for such facts as were
                        needed in our investigations, and that this was the only office where we
                        could obtain connected and intelligible facts and statements. As soon as the
                        charges referred to were noticed, I proceeded at once to investigate their
                        truth or falsity. On application for the premium arid interest account in
                        this office, ledger, journal and vouchers were instantly produced, and in
                        ten minutes were verified. I have here copies and abstracts of documents to
                        disprove the charges alluded to. Here is a copy of the account showing what
                        the fund has made out of premiums and interest for the last year. $13,811 80
                        is the net product of the interest on the floating balances on money
                        deposited and ready for a more permanent investment. Here are other copies
                        showing a carefulness of these officers almost approaching timidity. Here is
                        a contract with the Indianapolis Branch of the State Bank, who were the
                        depositaries, at one time, of about $60,000 of this fund, which was to draw
                        interest at 4 per cent., (although subject to call,) and to be compounded.
                        This contract was guaranteed by four private citizens of undoubted wealth.
                        More than this, during the money panic these officers who are charged with
                        looking specially after their individual interests, not satisfied with the
                        responsibility of this Branch Bank, of the corresponding liability of all
                        its associate Branches, and of the individual security taken, required and
                        obtained collateral security in the shape of business paper that had been
                        discounted by the Bank. Here is another copy showing the transactions of
                        this Board with its New York Agents, Winslow, Lanier & Co., in whose
                        responsibility and honesty the business men of Indiana have never felt a
                        doubt. They were employed to purchase, if practicable, the Bank bonds of the
                        State, and, failing in this, to buy our 5 per cent. certificates. The funds
                        were put in their hands for this purpose, and to bear 4 per cent. interest
                        while there remaining. During the suspension oi these Agents, and although
                        the bonds and certificates could not be had in the market at the price
                        limited, an interest of 7 per cent. was charged and collected; and during
                        the entire period of the deposit the most unquestionable collaterals, and of
                        an ample amount, were here in the vault of the Sinking Fund. At the same, or
                        about the same dates, the State Treasurer, with singular credulity,
                        deposited the money of the State with a Wall street speculator, John
                        Thompson; with the tottering Bank of the Capitol, and with the wild-cat
                        concern at Gosport, without taking any security, direct or collateral. Now,
                        I have said here and elsewhere, and again repeat, that I have seen nothing
                        in reference to the Treasurer which should even raise a doubt as to his
                        honesty; yet, while I commend his goodness of heart, I am unwilling to trust
                        the depositing and loaning of public money to his discretion, and I desire
                        to draw in, as soon as practicable, whatever has been deposited and loaned
                        by him and his predecessors, that we may take an account of stock; that we
                        may pass whatever is necessary to the account of profit and loss; and that
                        we may ascertain precisely where we do stand; and then, that we may open a
                        new set of books and start fair into the future. What method of
                        accomplishing all this as well as by the plan we propose? If the Treasurer
                        may deposit with twenty bankers or individuals, whose responsibility we do
                        not know, do we detract either from his usefulness, or even his dignity, by
                        designating a place of deposit that we do know to be safe? Is he beyond our
                        direction? Is the public money to be under the control of the Legislature or
                        of the Treasurer?
                    Again, it has been urged that there is no necessity of our immedicite action
                        - that the law has wisely given to the Governor, Auditor and Treas. urer the
                        power of making and negotiating the bonds of the State, not only for the
                        purpose of meeting the interest on the foreign debt, but for paying our
                        current expenses; or what amounts to the same thing, of effecting repeated
                        loans to meet the interest, and keeping the home receipts and funds to pay
                        expenses. This power, whatever it is, was granted by section 5th of the "Act
                        prescribing duties of Governor," approved May 27,1852. It is in these words
                        : "The Governor, Auditor and Treasurer of State, are hereby authorized (not
                        directed) to procure a temporary loan of money (not to
                        create a funded debt) sufficient in amount to meet the deficiency in the treasury, should any such occur, to pay the
                        semi- annual dividends of interest on
                        the State debt." Now, saying nothing of the unconstitutionality of the law
                        where the title does not correspond with the subject; making no argument on
                        the evident meaning of the words "sufficient" and "temporary," or on the
                        legal maxim, that in the presence of the principal the agents cannot act, I
                        say that if the word "deficiency" means any thing, these public officers
                        cannot borrow a dollar beyond the difference between the money in the
                        treasury and the amount of the interest. The accountant employed by our
                        committee has been able to post up the books and memoranda in the
                        Treasurer's office, so as to show that at least over $500,000 ought to have
                        been in the treasury, and with the Auditor, on the 22d day of last June,
                        when $165,000 was borrowed of the Sinking Fund to pay interest. It is
                        presumed that neither of the State officers had any accurate knowledge of
                        the fact; and I, for one, have no disposition to question the motives of
                        either. I state the facts merely to show the imperious necessity of
                        improving the system under which honest officers may be ruined, and the
                        State suffer immense loss. But, there being "no deficiency" in the treasury
                        on the 22d of June last, was there even the color of law for the borrowing
                        of the $165,000, and the subjecting the State to the payment of additional
                        interest? And, now, when this Legislature is in session, when the Treasurer
                        admits that there are in his hands $111,000less the sum paid out since the
                        13th of this monthover and above the deposits with broken banks and bankers,
                        and the investments in unavailable bills of exchange; when he says he can
                        spare at least $50,000 and pay the current expenses up to the 25th of
                        January; when we can find, here at home, the "deficiency" on a loan for two
                        or twenty months, I say that there is no law which authorizes one or any
                        number of the officers of State to create another funded debt, or to issue
                        coupon bonds at this time, for $165,000; and these, as we understand, have
                        already been manufactured and are now ready for negotiation. And, finally, I
                        remark that the bill we have brought forward is sufficient to effect the
                        purposes in view, and that no efficient substitute has been offered, or even
                        suggested. If faulty in principle or defective in detail, let it be repealed
                        or modified at our regular session.
                    To bring this discussion to a close in time to adopt, if this is rejected,
                        some other plan for preserving the credit and honor of the State, I now move
                        the previous question.
                    There being a second to the demand for the previous question, the vote of
                        Saturday, referring the bill again to the committee, was reconsidered, by
                        yeas 48, nays 43; and then the question recurred on the engrossment of the
                        bill.
