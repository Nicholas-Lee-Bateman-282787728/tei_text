            <head>The Adventurer-Artists of the Nineteenth Century and the Image of the American Indian</head>
            <byline>Francis Flavin<hi rend="sup">*</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>The American Indian became a popular subject for American painters during the early nineteenth
                    century. Artists who lived in the East produced Indian scenes in their studios, and artists who were
                    also adventurers traveled west to paint Indians firsthand in their native surroundings. These
                    paintings created an ideal of the American Indian as a generic Plains Indian, an image that became
                    increasingly popular as the nineteenth century wore on into the twentieth. While artists also
                    painted Indians from non-Plains tribes, these images never acquired the celebrity of the Plains
                    Indian, which reflected American tastes of the early and middle nineteenth century. These tastes,
                    along with the merits of individual artists and bizarre twists of fate, made it difficult for the
                    public to accept alternative versions of the Indian.</p>
            <p>American high culture first embraced the Indian during the 1820s. The esteem of American artists and
                    writers for the Indian following the War of 1812—a war sometimes called the Second War
                    for Independence—reflected two important forces. The first was the need for the young
                    republic to achieve cultural independence from Europe, and this was met by celebrating the Indian,
                    the frontier, and the wilderness that distinguished America from Europe. The second was the rise of
                    the Romantic tradition in America. Romanticism emphasized nature, indigenous customs, and
                    emotion—and Romantics associated the Indian with these terms.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Moreover this representation of the Indian emerged after the eastern half of the country had secured
                    itself against any serious threat from the aboriginal population, which permitted easterners to see
                    Indians as less menacing than before. Although Americans in the older region still may have seen the
                    Indian as savage—at least so far as savagery was antithetical to
                    civilization—they also could see him as noble, and the Romantic impulse facilitated this
                    ennoblement. To those who contemplated the fate of the Indians it appeared that civilization would
                    inevitably sweep them aside, hence Indians were a "vanishing race." This view was
                    quintessen- <list type="footnotes">

                    inevitable fate struck a tragic chord. Thus, from the 1820s through the 1850s, America's
                    literary and intellectual elite idealized the Indian in his native condition as noble, perhaps
                    savage, uniquely American, and vanishing.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    life failed to stir the imagination of Romantic thinkers, who were drawn only to the Indian in his
                    native condition. Since eastern Indians had lost their luster, the Romantics had only two choices:
                    either they could work from historical models, or they could work from contemporary models.</p>
            <p>The first option, working from history, could be accomplished with creative imagination. Writers
                    could reinterpret history in their stories, as James Fenimore Cooper did from the 1820s through the
                    1840s when he wrote with a Romantic bent about a youthful Leather-stocking who lived during the
                    second half of the eighteenth century. Although colonists living during the French and Indian War
                    certainly had seen the Indians as more savage than noble, Cooper, in <hi rend="i">The Last of the
                        Mohicans</hi> (1826), imposed on events situated in that period a Romantic interpretation that
                    reflected his own time. Likewise, artists like Thomas Cole could portray historical Indians with a
                    Romantic brush, as Cole did in <hi rend="i">Scene from the Last of the Mohicans</hi> (1826), <hi rend="i">View on Lake Winnipiseogee</hi> (1827), and <hi rend="i">Falls of Kaaterskill</hi>
                        (1826).<hi rend="sup">3</hi> However, working from historical images was difficult because much
                    representation of Indians produced during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries was
                    either crude or un-Romantic. The popular sixteenth-century woodcuts of Theodore de Bry, for example,
                    did not depict the Indian that nineteenth century Americans wanted to see. Hence contemporary
                    artists discarded historical images and looked elsewhere for models that satisfied their Romantic
                        worldview.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those who chose to work with contemporary subjects were unable to find the "right

                    </placeName>. Eastern Indians had become too "corrupted" by the vices of
                    civilization. To find the Indian in his natural state, artists had to look west of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where the equestrian tribes of the high plains were living in the "golden
                    age" of their horse and buffalo culture. Their nomadic lifestyle provided an appealing
                    model, and, consequently, the Romantics created their "new" Indian from the tribes
                    of the Great Plains.</p>

            <p>During the last decades of the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century, a new
                    kind of artist appeared on the world stage. These men left their studios and forayed into new,
                    distant, or exotic lands to render subjects that were little known to Europeans and Americans. Some
                    undertook journeys on their own; others traveled with a sponsor or a corporate or government
                    expedition. The adventurer-artist was not unique to America; during this period European artists
                    explored Africa, Asia, Oceania, the Americas, <placeName>

            <p>Adventurer-artists played a critical role in shaping America's popular image of the Indian.
                    Because the Plains Indian could be depicted only by painters on the scene, artists who visited these
                    tribes produced much of the new artwork. Unfortunately, the Lewis and Clark expedition of
                    1804–1806, perhaps the greatest adventure into America's West, was undertaken
                    without the services of an artist. Meriwether Lewis had intended to publish a handsomely illustrated
                    account of his trip "embellished with a number of plates illustrative of the dress and
                    general appearance of [the] Indian nations" they visited, along with "their
                    habitations; their weapons and habiliments used in war; their hunting and fishing apparatus,
                    &amp; c." Lewis expected to hire the famed <placeName>

                    </placeName> artist and naturalist, Charles Will-son Peale, to create the illustrations. However,
                    after Lewis's death in 1809, William Clark, admitting his limitations as a writer, turned
                    the project over to Nicholas Biddle, who published an account of the expedition in 1814, but without
                        illustrations.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>This mistake was not repeated when Major Stephen H. Long explored the Rockies in
                    1819–1820. Peale persuaded the war department to allow his son Titian Ramsay Peale and
                    Samuel Seymour to serve as artists for the expedition. Long journeyed from Saint Louis up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, up the Platte, then southward along the eastern edge of the Rockies until he reached
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>. There, he split his force, one group traveling down the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the other down the Canadian, and ultimately, the two parties rendezvoused at Fort
                    Smith on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>. The artists were very productive on the trip, executing nearly three hundred sketches
                    and watercolors between them. They created the first Euro-American illustrations of the buffalo hide
                    teepee, a buffalo grazing on the open plains, and the equestrian Plains warrior. Although each of
                    these subjects came to symbolize the American Indian, the works of Peale and Seymour did not
                    influence the popular image of the American Indian. Only a handful of the renderings were
                    published—most of them landscapes—in the 1823 travel account, which received
                    mixed reviews, and the illustrations that did appear failed to satisfy Romantic tastes.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>Catlin (1796–1872) was the most dedicated and most prolific. In 1821 in <placeName>

                    </placeName> he encountered a delegation of "noble and dignified-looking Indians, from the
                    wilds of the ‘Far West’…. " So intrigued was Catlin by
                    these "lords of the forest" who "strutted about the city" in
                    "silent and stoic dignity" that he dedicated himself to "becoming their

                    era's characteristic Romanticism, and most of his writings are heavy with Romantic
                    sentiments. He thought that the Indians were in a state of "rapid declension" and
                    soon would vanish. Furthermore, he claimed that the "honourable" attributes of the
                    Indians were discernable only when they were in a pristine, precontact state. Catlin believed that
                    nearly 70 percent of the two million contemporary American Indians were "already the
                    miserable living victims and dupes of the white man's cupidity, degraded, discouraged and

                    Maximilian's estate sustained a loss on the project because the aquatints did not sell
                    well. While there were 275 German subscriptions to Maximilian's texts, fewer than 60
                    subscribers requested hand-colored editions. Thus, though the reproductions were stunningly
                    lifelike, authentic, and colorful, Bodmer's art did not reach a wide audience: in the
                    nineteenth century his work was neither as widely exhibited as Catlin's nor as frequently
                        reproduced.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>Catlin and Bodmer did much to document American Indian life in the middle of the nineteenth century,
                    and their greatest and most significant work depicted Plains Indians.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                    Historians, novelists, anthropologists, and enthusiasts have returned frequently to them in search
                    of information. The style, the range, and—especially in Bodmer's
                    case—the quality of their pictures have given these sources an enduring charm and have
                    made the Plains Indian recognizable to the world.</p>
            <p>Catlin and Bodmer also had an indirect effect on the popular perceptions of Native Americans. Their
                    examples inspired other artists to draw and paint the Plains Indian; publishers sought Indian
                    illustrations based directly upon their works (as was the case for the original edition of Francis
                    Parkman's <hi rend="i">

                    then placed the new pictures in a wide array of media. History texts, novels, and literary works
                    included visual representations of Indians that borrowed heavily from the paintings of Catlin and
                    Bodmer. The Indian lithographs of Currier and Ives, a major vehicle for the dissemination of the
                    image of the Indian, drew heavily from the Catlin and Bodmer exhibits in <list type="footnotes">

                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> painter, Alfred Jacob Miller. In 1837 Scottish nobleman William Drummond Stewart, who
                    had served under Wellington in his campaigns against Napoleon, hired Miller to accompany him on an
                    expedition into America's West. Mired in a dull marriage and alienated from his older
                    brother, who inherited the family estate, Stewart in 1833 escaped to America "for the sole
                    purpose of penetrating the great wilderness of the West."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> While in
                    Saint Louis in 1833, Stewart had happened to meet Prince Maximilian. The two men had discussed the
                    possibility of uniting their expeditions, but because Maximilian pursued science and Stewart the
                    hunt, they decided against a joint venture. Stewart probably learned that Maximilian was to bring
                    along Bodmer as the expedition's artist, and this may have inspired Stewart to approach
                    Miller in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>It is unlikely that Miller was much influenced by the work of either Catlin or Bodmer. Miller had not
                    seen Catlins paintings, and it is unlikely that he had even heard of Bodmer and almost certainly had
                    not seen any of his work, since Bodmer was only then preparing his water-colors to be transformed
                    into aquatints for publication.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Miller's Indians were more often
                    types than real Indians, while Bodmer's Indians were real—they were often
                    renditions of actual individuals whom Bodmer painted as they appeared. Catlin's paintings
                    were more hurried and less precise than Bodmer's, but, like Bodmer, he was interested in
                    the Indians. Since Miller was interested in the spirit of the hunt and, of course, in pleasing
                    Stewart, his work does not focus on Indians. Nevertheless, Indians pervade the imagery of
                    Miller's West. He painted Shoshoni Indians, the Sioux, the Crow, the Pawnee, the <list type="footnotes">

                            the two men when they met in Saint Louis in 1833, there were other cases in which artists
                            accompanied wealthy travelers on exotic trips from which Stewart may have drawn his

                    just over two hundred field sketches from his trip to the Rockies, and because Miller replicated and

                    </placeName>, but it is unclear how much of what he exhibited was from his trip to the West. Stewart
                    had asked Miller to attempt a set of lithographs for an account of their travels, but Miller, citing
                    illness, declined, and no account was published.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Miller replicated many of his
                    field sketches for Stewart at Murthly Castle and for other patrons, but his work never loomed large
                    in the public eye. As historian Peter Hasrick has noted, while Catlin caused a social and political
                    clamor over preserving the memory of a vanishing race, "Miller contented himself with
                    having savored the taste of a rare holiday, an experience he would share guardedly with intimates
                    and select patrons."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>Miller's work had not enjoyed a wide audience in his own day, and by the middle of the

                            colored prints, asked Miller to consider a similar undertaking in February 1842. Miller
                            responded, "I received your esteemed favor of the 20th and must ask your kind
                            indulgence until I reach home before I attempt the lithographs…. I am sure I
                            should not like to offer any things of the kind without having bestowed some labour on them
                            and I feel that this would be impossible at the present as I am sick both in body and
                            mind—a depression and anxiety hangs over me that I cannot throw off. I shall
                            think myself fortunate in being able to finish the present picture at which I am steadily
                            working." Miller produced several prints when he returned to <placeName>

                            </placeName>. He also permitted Charles Willrins Webber to produce chomolithographs for <hi rend="i">The Hunter-Naturalist: The Romance of Sporting</hi> (1854) and <hi rend="i">The
                                Hunter-Naturalist: Wild Scenes and Song-Birds</hi> (1854), each of which had five plates
                            based on work from Miller's western adventure. One of Miller's more
                            renowned paintings, <hi rend="i">Lost on the Prairies</hi>, was published as a separate
                            chromolithograph. Miller's lithographic credits were meager, however. When Miller
                            was making his decision in 1842 about whether to publish his Indian pictures in a joint
                            venture with Stewart he had to consider whether the market would bear yet more volumes on
                            this theme. Thomas McKenney and James Hall had already published three volumes of Indian
                            portraits in the 1830s, and Catlin and Bodmer had begun recently to publish their impressive
                            work. These considerations discouraged him from agreeing to Stewart's proposal.

                    Miller's paintings were dreamy, timeless, and quintessentially Romantic, and their artistic
                    merit has prompted considerable praise. And, because many twentieth-century Americans continue to
                    appreciate the Romantic Indian, Miller's work attracts an audience, though
                    nineteenth-century audiences hardly noticed it.</p>

            <p>While Miller was not influenced by Catlin or Bodmer, Carl Wimar (1828–1862) surely was. A
                    German-born immigrant to Saint Louis, who painted numerous scenes of frontier and Indian life during
                    the 1850s, Wimar was solidly within their tradition. Although Wimar visited the Upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> in 1858-1859, many of his Indian paintings were completed before he traveled up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>; his conception of the American Indian was based on the work of other artists,
                    especially that of Catlin and Bodmer.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Not all Wimar's subjects were
                    Plains Indians: he executed two notable oil-on-canvas versions of <hi rend="i">Abduction of Daniel <placeName>

                    </placeName> Seminole chief Billy Bowlegs. However, most of his western paintings featured Plains
                    motifs such as the buffalo, equestrianism, the Plains landscape, and skirmishes between Indians and
                    Americans. Wimar reinforced the linkage between the Indian and the buffalo and thus helped to
                    underscore the representativeness of the Plains Indian to the Euro-American public. Furthermore,
                    Wimar's images were Romantic, and his work served to further associate the Plains Indian
                    with Romantic sentiments.</p>
            <p>Wimar's <hi rend="i">Attack on an Emigrant Train</hi> (1854, 1856) was an especially popular
                    work. It was recognized by his contemporaries at art school in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> as a commendable painting. When Wimar returned from <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    distributed nationwide and did much to develop the myth that Indians regularly attacked emigrant
                    wagon trains. Felix O. C. Darley, who never traveled to the West but was ‘perhaps the
                    most successful western illustrator of his era,’ copied the print soon after it appeared.
                    Darley's knowledge of the West came principally from other artists, especially Wimar and
                    Catlin. <hi rend="i">Attack on an Emigrant Train</hi> was copied on a large scale by Thomas Hill,
                    and it also inspired the German-American artist Emanuel Leutze, who painted <hi rend="i">

               </hi>, to produce a similar work. In 1869 Wimar's version won first prize
                    at the Saint Louis Annual Fair, and in 1893 it was displayed at the World's Columbian

            <p>Clearly, the quality, the artistic appeal, and the widespread dissemination of artwork by Catlin,
                    Bodmer, and their disciples did much to publicize the Plains Indians during the first half of the
                    nineteenth century. Their work laid the foundation for the ascendency of the Plains Indian image,

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and in Europe.</p>
            <p>It is reasonable to ask why no other type of Indian seemed to rival the Plains Indian in the American
                    imagination during the mid-nineteenth century. There were other artists painting other Indian
                    subjects at the time: why has their legacy failed to influence Euro-American perceptions more
                    strongly in the twentieth century and beyond? A simplified answer is that these artists were less
                    talented, failed to supply an image of the Indian that consumers wanted, or produced a corpus that
                    did not survive.</p>
            <p>James Otto Lewis is an example of an artist who depicted native people principally from the Old
                    Northwest and Great Lakes. He painted dozens of the Indians who gathered for the negotiation of the
                    treaties of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>

                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> (1826), and Green Bay (1827). Lewis published his work in ten portfolio installments,
                    beginning in 1835, before any of Catlin's work had appeared. Lewis's portfolios
                    were relatively affordable, only two dollars each, and like Catlin he had traveled west to see
                    Indians closer to their aboriginal settings so that his paintings might be "faithfully and
                    accurately given." He emphasized that he painted "while travelling through a
                    wilderness, far removed from the abodes of civilization."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Lewis's work failed to find a large audience. His portraits were blocky, labored, and
                    uninspiring, and he never attempted to paint action scenes. Of the seventy-two plates in the <hi rend="i">Aboriginal Port Folio</hi>, two were landscapes, fifty-six were bust portraits, and
                    fourteen were full-length portraits. Moreover, although Lewis concentrated on portraiture, he lacked
                    the basic ability to render a human face. One twentieth-century critic opined that "[elyes
                    and giant noses wandered about his Indian faces, anticipating Picasso without the
                        intention."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Many of Lewis's Indians wore Euro-American
                    clothing, and because they were painted in either bust-portraits or static full-length likenesses,
                    these Indians were shown separated from their native environs. In fact, many looked quite
                    assimilated. Euro-Americans of the nineteenth century who longed to see "natural"
                    and "wild" Indians did not find them in Lewis's <hi rend="i">Aboriginal

            </p>
            <p>The strengths of Catlin's work are apparent when compared with Lewis's offerings.
                    Catlin's <hi rend="i">Letters and Notes</hi>, published five years after Lewis's
                    portfolios, offered more drawings in more categories, including 300 "Indian
                    Portraits," 93 "landscapes," 17 "Sporting Scenes," 30
                    "Amusements," 29 "Manners and Customs," 4 "Mandan
                    Religious Ceremonies," and 6 "Indian Curiosities." The <hi rend="i">North
                        American Indian Portfolio</hi> that Catlin published in 1844 showed Indians in action. In his
                    portfolio Catlin offered 25 plates—ach executed more skillfblly than any of
                    Lewis's. Even Catlin's few still-lifes seemed to impart an important message.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> The other plates in Catlin's portfolio showed Indian life: hunting
                    scenes, dances, and Indian games, for example. Although Catlin himself had artistic weaknesses, his
                    works had more spirit than did any of Lewis's, and in comparison with Lewis he was clearly
                    the superior artist.</p>
            <p>Like Bodmer, Miller, and Wimar, Catlin evoked an emotional response from viewers. Painted by
                    Romantics, Indians appeared noble, natural, and native. These Indians—Indians of the
                    Plains—dressed in buckskins, rode horses, hunted buffalo, lived in tepees, and wore
                    feathers; in short, they were unmistakably Indians, unlike the assimilated, partly
                    "civilized" Indians Lewis pictured.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Lewis had offered little textual information to supplement his artwork. Catlin's
                        <hi rend="i">Letters and Notes</hi> contained several hundred pages of text reporting his
                    adventures among the Indians of the Upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, and his <hi rend="i">North American Indian Portfolio</hi> offered several paragraphs
                    of descriptive and didactic text along with each image. These descriptions, using Romantic imagery
                    and supplying firsthand information, undoubtedly enhanced the marketability of his publications. For
                    example, Catlin closes his description of the ball players in plate number 23 with the following:

                            </placeName>, he was clad in buckskins and accoutered in fine chiefly regalia. This Catlin
                            depicted on the left pane of his image; on the right pane Catlin showed Wi-Jun-Jon on his
                            return. He returned to his tribe dressed in a soldier's uniform, smoking a
                            cigarette, leaning on an umbrella with one hand, and holding an accordion fan with his
                            other. From each of his back pockets conspicuously protruded a whiskey bottle. The painting
                            conveyed Catlin's view that "civilization" corrupted the Indians.
                            This image was the last of twenty-five plates; assuredly Catlin wanted his audience to close
                            his book thinking that, while Indians were noble in their natural state, civilization
                            degraded them lamentably. George Catlin, <hi rend="i">Catlin's North American

            <p>Had Lewis been a Catlin or a Bodmer—had his work been vividly executed and inspiring and
                    had it been published in large numbers—could the Great Lakes Indians, particularly the
                    Chippewas, have rivaled the Plains Indians and the Sioux in popularity? The Chippewas are the most
                    prominently featured tribe in Lewis's <hi rend="i">Aboriginal Port Folio</hi>, with
                    twenty-three plates, followed by the Winnebagoes with twelve, the Miamis with eleven, and the
                    Potawatomis with nine. Very likely these natives were too assimilated to have been embraced as
                    "the American Indian," whether they had been painted by Lewis or Catlin. Thus,
                    both because of his own shortcomings and because of the assimilated condition of his subjects, Lewis
                    was unable to provide an appealing alternative to the Plains Indian.</p>
            <p>Like Lewis, George Winter (1810–1876) also painted Indians from the Old Northwest. Winter,

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. When he heard of the impending removal of Potawatomi Indians from their
                        <geogName>Wabash Valley</geogName> reservations in Indiana, Winter was prompted by "the
                    enthusiasm of adventure and the love of the romantic" to journey to Indiana to paint the
                    Potawatomis. From 1837 through the early 1840s Winter observed native life on the Indiana frontier.
                    He painted and sketched various scenes of Miami and Potawatomi Indians and kept descriptive notes in
                    his field journal. In the 1860s and 1870s he reworked much of this earlier material, and by the time
                    of his death in 1876, Winter had produced just over 230 sketches and paintings of Indians.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Some of his works, most notably his watercolors, although not masterly, were

                    quantity of his work suggested that Winter might have been a prominent figure among frontier
                    artists. Unfortunately, Winter's reputation was greatly diminished by two factors.</p>
            <p>First, Winter's work was largely unnoticed during his own day. Outside a small, provincial
                    art market in northern Indiana Winter was not well known. He occasionally exhibited at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but his paintings did not draw many viewers, and he lacked Catlin's zeal as a
                        showman.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Second, Winter's paintings showed assimilated Indians, the Miami and Potawatomi Indians of
                    Indiana. During the 1830s and 1840s, the decades in which he painted them, these tribes had
                    undergone significant acculturation; in their clothing, their dwellings, their behavior, their
                    pastimes, and their personal names, Winter's Indians looked much like
                    Euro-Americans—specially like French Creoles. Many wore brightly colored clothing of
                    Euro-American manufacture, calico prints for example. Many lived in log cabins. While some had
                    native names like "Pel-we-me" and "Yo-ca-top-kone," others had
                    names like Francis and Jim Godfroy—names either meaningless or unremarkable to the
                    EumAmerican ear. These Miamis and Potawatomis played cards, fished on the gently flowing river, or
                    laundered clothes at its bank—hardly a Romantic way of life. Thus, Winter's
                    subjects lacked the allure of the "wild" Indians untainted by civilization. For
                    modern students the greatest value of the Winter paintings is that they document the process of
                    acculturation at work among the Miamis and Potawatomis in the 1830s and 1840s.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
                    But they were not the Indians craved by the nineteenth-century imagination.</p>
            <p>Two of Winter's works did enjoy considerable success. <hi rend="i">Spotted Fawn, or Chiefs
                        Daughter</hi> was based on a work entitled <hi rend="i">The Chiefs Daughter</hi> by John Gadsby
                    Chapman, a famous artist of the day. Winter replicated <hi rend="i">Spotted Fawn</hi> several times
                    and sold the copies. The work was also used as an illustration in Henry Rowe Schoolcraft's
                        <hi rend="i">The American Zndians</hi> (1851).<hi rend="sup">40</hi> It owed its popularity to
                    its sentimental and sex-ualized portrayal of a young woman. Winter's rendition of
                    Darley's <hi rend="i">The Indian Captive</hi> apparently sold well, and Winter produced
                    multiple copies of it.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> As with <hi rend="i">Spotted Fawn</hi>, this painting

                    the Euro-American idea of the Indian.</p>
            <p>Although Winter had enjoyed at least a modest recognition in northern Indiana in the late nineteenth
                    century, by the turn of the century his name was forgotten. Like Miller's work,
                    Winter's paintings were "rediscovered" in the 1930s. Evelyn Ball, the
                    wife of Winter's grandson, was observing the demolition of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> warehouse owned by the Ball family, when she noticed a workman on the second floor
                    knock a painted canvas from an ornate frame and into a waiting dump truck. Horrified, Ball
                    intervened and in the process chanced upon boxes and trunks full of Winter's
                    correspondence, notes, and renderings.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

            <p>Since then his works have been exhibited often in Indiana, and in 1948 the Indiana Historical Society
                    published <hi rend="i">The Journals and Indian Paintings of George Winter,
                    1837–1839</hi>, which contained thirty-one plates, all but three of which were of Native
                    American subjects. In 1993 the society in cooperation with the <placeName>

                    paintings. Thus, more than a century after the artist's death in 1876, Winter's
                    paintings have been made available in their entirety to a national audience. But this increased
                    visibility came too late to influence the popular perceptions of American Indians. Just as
                    Lewis's Chippewas failed to seize the popular imagination, so too did the Miamis and
                    Potawatomis of George Winter.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

                            to afford a receptive audience for Winter's art. His Indians may be seen to
                            symbolize the blending of multiple cultures—indigenous, imperial, and national.
                            In the increasingly blended and borderless world of the present century, Winter's

                            typifies the prevailing Romantic sentiments of the mid-nineteenth century. This painting
                            shows a group of Indians on the shore of the Pacific Ocean, ostensibly having been pushed to
                            this westward extreme by the advance of the frontier. A setting sun and buffalo skulls
                            scattered on the ground suggest the imminent fate of the Indian. The presence of infants as
                            well as young, middle-aged, and elderly men and women are in this painting suggests that the
                            fate of all Indians will be the same. Stanley, a rival of Catlin's for government

                    portraiture throughout the Midwest during the late 1830s. Although he never admitted it in print,
                    Stanley was inspired by Catlin's example to devote his talents to making a pictorial record
                    of America's aborigines. Stanley was a laconic but disparaging rival who sought for himself

            <p>Stanley traveled extensively in search of Indian subjects to populate his "Indian
                    gallery," hoping that his collection of Indian paintings would surpass Catlin's.
                    Stanley first traveled to Indian Territory in 1843 and 1844, where he painted Cherokees, Creeks, and
                    Choctaws at Fort Gibson. Stanley and his business partner and fellow artist, Sumner Dickerman,
                    exhibited a selection of their modest but growing collection of Indian paintings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1846: they showed 83 "finished works" from the 124 portraits,
                    landscapes, and sketches they had created in the Indian territory. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers heralded the Stanley-Dickerman Indian gallery as "far superior to
                    Catlin's far famed portraits." Despite such praise, only a trickle of visitors
                    attended their show, and they were no more successful in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Perhaps Catlin had drained the novelty from the Indian gallery enterprise.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Or, perhaps Stanley's subject matter was too tame; the removed
                    southern tribes that he had painted looked civilized and assimilated in comparison with Plains
                    Indians.</p>
            <p>Stanley was able to augment his collection further when he was allowed to accompany Stephen Watts
                    Kearny on an expedition from Saint Louis to San Diego. From there Stanley journeyed north to <placeName>

                    This action-filled trip lasted from 1846 through 1848 and gave Stanley the material to diversify and
                    enhance his gallery. Now the gallery boasted 134 paintings representing fifty different tribes. Once
                    again, despite testimonials from reviewers, when Stanley exhibited his paintings in

                    Congress. As Catlin had done before him (unsuccessfully), Stanley sought to sell the gallery to the
                    federal government by arguing that the nation was in some sense obligated to preserve his
                    ethnological and historical record of these vanishing peoples.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>While his gallery remained on display, Stanley accepted an offer to accompany a government-authorized
                    survey of a northerly route to the Pacific. During 1853, he and the surveying entourage steamed
                    upriver from Saint Louis to Saint Paul and then traveled overland just south of the Canadian border
                    across the Great Plains, the Rockies, and down to the Pacific. His work would illustrate the <hi rend="i">Reports of Explorations and Surveys, to Ascertain the most Practicable and Economical

                    a twelve-volume series that was published between 1853 and 1856.</p>
            <p>Stanley also participated in the trendy "moving panorama" market that flourished in
                    the 1850s. In the late-eighteenth century Europeans had invented the "cyclorama."
                    Its purpose was to envelop the viewer with a sense of participation in the scene that the artist was
                    attempting to represent. The viewer would stand on an elevated platform in the middle of an enormous
                    room, several hundred feet in circumference. High walls, reaching perhaps fifty feet, were painted
                    with images, and near the tops of the walls the sky blended with the natural light flooding through
                    a glass roof. By arraying props across the floor, the artist could add to the authentic feel of his
                    scene. From the cyclorama model Americans developed "moving panoramas," in which
                    an artist painted a lengthy canvas or even a continuous series of canvases that might stand a dozen
                    feet high and extend two miles in length. A canvas would be connected to two spindles (rolled on one
                    spindle and affixed to the other), and as the canvas was pulled from one spindle to the other
                    viewers would see a story unfold before their dazzled eyes. Moving panoramas were especially
                    effective for relating linear stories and of course for illustrating the way a journey would be seen
                    from the window of a train, the deck of a steamboat, or on horseback. Stanley created a <hi rend="sup">'</hi> Western Wilds" panorama that was on display from September

            <p>The Smithsonian fire was a tragedy not only for Stanley and the museum, but for all people who
                    appreciate the art of the American West. In 1846 his Indian gallery had consisted principally of
                    southeastern Indians, Sac and Foxes, and Indians of the southern Plains. At this point he had
                    painted no tribes of the northern Plains—specifically, no Sioux.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Of
                    course, his gallery had grown in later years and included Indians of the Southwest and Pacific
                    Northwest, and probably of the northern Plains. However, even if Stanley's gallery had
                    survived to offer a visual alternative to the Plains Indian, it is unlikely that it would have
                    altered America's popular perception of the Indian, since too many artists favored the
                    Plains tribes. Some of Stanley's paintings are extant and have had little effect on the
                    image of the Indian. His portraits of the Cherokees from Indian Territory have survived, but <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Stanley sometimes brought with him a daguerreotype apparatus on his journeys west, and many of his
                    paintings bear the characteristics of scenes composed for that early form of photography. His scenes
                    are static; they lack action and emotion.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> This is particularly true of his
                    illustrations for the Pacific railroad survey. These illustrations, never reproduced in large
                    quantities, are especially devoid of emotion. Many of his drawings were done to showcase landscapes,
                    but even the ones that focused on natives are rather inert. These illustrations have color, but they
                    are shaded rather than colored. Most images fade from green to blue or from red to orange to brown.
                    They have a beauty of their own, but they hardly pulse with action and excitement. Stanley never
                    drew for the survey reports the portraits of the principal chiefs that he had planned, but it seems
                    likely that they would not have had a significant impact on the public.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

            <p>Stanley's influence was further diminished because he was neither an effective showman nor
                    aggressive in publishing his works. With the exception of the effort he put into his
                    "Western Wilds" panorama, Stanley never really played the showman. Although he
                    sought to publicize his events, his quiet and unassuming personality prevented him from attracting
                    larger audiences. In this sense he was markedly different from Catlin. Furthermore, although
                    Stanley's gallery was quite attractive, he never attempted to publish reproductions of it.
                    His audience was limited chiefly to those who saw his paintings while they were on display at the
                    Smithsonian. Moreover, Stanley, unlike Catlin, never wrote an account of his adventures. Someone
                    with Stanley's experiences might have produced a popularly-accessible illustrated narrative
                    of his travels among the Indians, but Stanley never did. Perhaps his ineptitude with the written
                    word was to blame.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Unfortunately, although much of Stanley's Indian
                    art would have appealed to American tastes, most of it vanished in the Smithsonian fire and was thus
                    denied to posterity.</p>
            <p>Wimar was an exceptionally talented artist who painted Indians and Indian scenes of the American
                    West. However, he died young and never realized his enormous potential. Though the outbreak of the
                    Civil War disrupted life in Saint Louis, after unionist elements had secured the city against rebel
                    agitation business boomed for Wimar. His artistic talents won him much acclaim, and in order to
                    secure a comfortable living he took on more commissions than he could complete. He contracted
                    tuberculosis and could not continue his work. Wimar died in 1862 at age thirty-four.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1858 and on several later occasions, Wimar had journeyed up the <geogName>Missouri
                    River</geogName> by steamboat. From these adventures he produced some striking Plains depictions,
                    such as <hi rend="i">Indians Approaching Fort Union, Buffalos Crossing the Yellowstone, Buffalo
                    Hunt</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Buffalo Dance.</hi> During these excursions he met hundreds of Indians,
                    many of them Sioux but some from other tribes, such as the Arikaras and the Mandans. It is apparent
                    that Wimar developed an amicable relationship with natives of the Upper <placeName>

                    </placeName>, since they reportedly grieved at news of his death. His studio was full of native
                    implements that he had procured while on the river. It was described by one biographer as
                    "a perfect museum of Indian curiosities, and at the time of his death he possessed what was
                    then probably the best collection of Indian weapons, implements and costumes in the
                        country."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> It is interesting to wonder what Wimar might have

                    the Euro-American mind the image of the Romantic Plains Indian.</p>
            <p>One of the most important developments in the dominant perception of the American Indian was the
                    nineteenth-century popularization of the Plains Indian, for which the adventurer-artists were
                    largely responsible. Had Catlin, Bodmer, and their disciples been less skilled and prolific the
                    Plains Indian might not have established such an ascendency in the American imagination. However,
                    one must not overstate the importance of adventurer-artists. It may be argued that although Catlin,
                    Bodmer, Miller, and Wimar helped to make the Plains Indian famous, it was even more the case that
                    the Plains Indian made these artists famous. A public audience that recognized the mid-nineteenth
                    century Plains Indian as the ideal Indian showered acclaim on the artists who painted them. Others
                    such as Winter, Lewis, and even Stanley in his younger days, who painted more assimilated Indians,
                    were not widely embraced by either contemporaries or posterity.</p>
            <p>To be sure, other influences contributed later to the dominance of the Plains Indian image during the
                    nineteenth and twentieth centuries, including Custer's famed "last stand"
                    at the Little Bighorn against the Sioux and the Cheyenne, the national and international celebrity
                    of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, the infamous Wounded Knee massacre, and the distinctive
                    characteristics of the Plains tribes. But even before the Civil War, America had chosen the Plains
                    Indian as the representative embodiment for all American Indians, and adventurer-artists had
                    strongly influenced that choice.</p>

            <head>Introducing Black Harry Hoosier: The History Behind Indiana's Namesake</head>
            <byline>Stephen H. Webb<hi rend="sup">*</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>Indiana's nickname is as distinctive as its source is mysterious. Early in the nineteenth
                    century, Hoosier was a common synonym in the South for a yokel or bumpkin, but there is no record of
                    how the term came to be used as slang or what it originally meant. The earliest Indiana settlers
                    brought this word with them from the Appalachian region, but they left behind no trace of its
                    etymology. By the middle of the nineteenth century, Indiana citizens had transformed this label of
                    abuse and disparagement into a badge of pride and identity. Indiana folk were proud to be Hoosiers,
                    but what did that mean?</p>
            <p>While nicknames like Buckeye, Badger, and Wolverine need no explanation, the derivation of Hoosier
                    has become a source of amusement and speculation. Kentuckians were the first to joke that the term
                    came from the practice of isolated Indiana farmers yelling "Who's yere"
                    to approaching strangers. There was also a yarn about a bar fight after which somebody wondered
                    "whose ear" was left lying on the floor. Hoosiers themselves, trying to put a more
                    respectable spin on their name, sometimes told about a man with that surname who hired people from
                    Indiana to work outside the state. Indianans were thus associated with a certain Mr. Hoosier.
                    Although it might be pleasing to imagine that the nickname comes from an original Hoosier who
                    treated his workers so well that they became identified with him, there is no evidence to support
                    the existence of this mythological figure.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, it is unnecessary to invent a first Hoosier because one already exists, and he was a
                    noted figure in his own right. Historians of early American religion have long acknowledged the
                    importance of Harry Hoosier, a Methodist preacher famous for his eloquence.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Those who heard Hoosier preach found him hard to forget. Dr. Benjamin Rush (1745–1813), a
                    signer of the Declaration of Independence, acknowledged that "making allowances for his
                    illiteracy he was the greatest orator in America."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Outside a narrow

            <p>Although there is no full biography of Harry Hoosier, there is plenty of evidence from Methodist

                    (1703–1791) sought to reform the Anglican Church through revival, and as a result he
                    founded what came to be called Methodism. Wesley took the Christian message to those who were on the
                    margins of established religion by delivering passionate sermons that emphasized a personal, rather
                    than institutional, expression of faith. Since Wesley worked outside the regular channels of
                    Anglican authority, he recruited lay persons to assist him with evangelism. Wesley required these
                    exhorters, as they were sometimes known, to travel widely in order to preach to the unchurched. Thus
                    was born the Methodist system of itinerant ministry.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    </placeName>. Vast tracts of land were settled sparsely, and ordained and educated clergy were in
                    short supply. The Methodists took religion to the people by organizing revival meetings where
                    passion was more important than doctrine. Weeping, shouting, and groaning were common at these
                    services, although the emphasis was on deliverance from sin and the joyful experience of salvation
                    that was available to everyone. The converted were encouraged to demonstrate their experience of
                    God's grace by growing in holiness and Christian perfection. They were supported by
                    Methodist societies that, at first, were meant to supplement, not replace, traditional churches.</p>
            <p>Those who heard the call to preach at these revivals had to be prepared for a hard life on the road,
                    without the comforts of a family or a permanent home. Many of these exhorters had as little access
                    to formal schooling or organized religion as those who came to hear <list type="footnotes">

                    These people included African Americans, both freedmen and slaves. Blacks were attracted to the

                    participate alongside whites. They were also inspired by the strong stand the Methodist leadership,

            <p>Harry Hoosier was one of the first and possibly the best of this group. He was illiterate, so the
                    spelling of his name varies in the sources (Hosier, Hoosier, Hoshur, and Homier). All of the
                    spellings of his name by his contemporaries, however, produce the same phonetic effect, and the way
                    he pronounced his name is similar to the way Hoosier is pronounced today. Nevertheless, the evidence
                    for the connection between his name and Indiana's nickname is circumstantial, which leaves
                    room for skepticism. Compared to the alternative explanations, however, this theory not only makes a
                    better story but also has an explanatory power that the others lack. Surely it is more than
                    coincidence that the evolution of this term followed the same path that the early Indiana settlers
                    took from the Appalachian frontier. It also makes sense that these pioneers would have been eager to
                    forget its origin, consciously or unconsciously. Moreover, many nicknames began as slurs on
                    religious activities or expressions of racial prejudice, and this theory fits that pattern.</p>
            <p>Hoosier's birthdate is usually given as 1750, but there is no documentation about either his
                    parents or his early years. Some have speculated that he was a slave of Harry Dorsey Gough
                    (17?-1808), who owned a plantation near <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Gough converted to Methodism and built a chapel on his property where circuit riders
                    would preach twice a month. Though no one knows where or how Harry Hoosier obtained his last name,
                    at some point after he was manumitted his speaking skills came to the attention of the Methodist
                        leadership.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Francis Asbury (1745–1816), the patriarch of American Methodism, answered
                    Wesley's call for workers to spread the movement in America in 1771 and traveled from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was a diligent evangelist whose wide travels served as a model for the subsequent
                    circuit riders who took Methodism to the frontier. During the American Revolution Asbury was forced
                    to go into hiding, because Wesley's opposition to the war made him vulnerable to charges of
                    sympathizing with the Tones. Afterwards Asbury emerged, along with Thomas Coke, as the leader of the
                    Methodist movement. At his side was the first African American to obtain national prestige as a
                    religious figure, Harry Hoosier.</p>
            <p>Asbury first mentions Hoosier in his journal in an entry dated June 28, 1780, though it has been
                    suggested that they met as early as 1775. At first, Hoosier accompanied Asbury as a traveling
                    companion and servant; but Hoosier soon proved himself a worthy colleague. Asbury preached to white
                    people while Hoosier preached to slaves. Hoosier would substitute for Asbury when he was sick, and
                    in some cases, Hoosier was asked to preach immediately after Asbury finished his sermon. At Falls
                    Church, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, Asbury wrote, ‘Reached at the Chapel; afterwards Harry, a black man, spoke
                    on the barren fig-tree. The circumstance was new, and the white people looked on with
                        attention."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> This was the first opportunity for this audience to
                    hear a public speech by a black man.</p>
            <p>By all accounts, his white audiences liked what they saw and heard. Asbury admits in his journal that
                    the best way to draw a large congregation was to announce that Hoosier would preach. While the
                    content of his sermons probably differed little from those of his fellow exhorters, his style was
                    significantly different. A contemporary description of Hoosier provides clues for understanding his
                    success: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>He was of middling stature; slim, but very strongly built, and very black; capable of great
                            labour and much endurance. He also possessed a most musical voice, which he could modulate
                            with the skill of a master, and use with the most complete success in the pathetic,
                            terrible, or persuasive parts of a discourse… He was never at a loss in
                            preaching, but was very acceptable wherever he went, and few of the white preachers could
                            equal him, in his way.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>Like most preachers of his era, Hoosier appealed directly to the heart in an attempt to convince his
                    listeners of their sins and persuade them that they needed to repent. He was especially famous for
                    his ability to bring his audience to a climactic pitch of emotional tension. It is tempting to
                    attribute his style to his African heritage. Traditional African religions encouraged a wide range
                    of intense emotional expressions. Some recent scholars, however, suggest that this style of
                    preaching was derived from and typical of English and Scottish evangelicals.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                    There is probably truth in both views. Hoosier would have modeled his sermons on the preachers who
                    converted him, but he also made significant contributions to the evangelical style of worship. His
                    years of enslavement must have enabled him to address the hopes and fears of his black audiences
                    with particular poignancy.</p>
            <p>Many preachers, both black and white, lacked formal education in those days, so Hoosier's
                    illiteracy probably did not hinder his success. According to one observer, "Harry could
                    remember passages of scripture and quote them accurately; and hymns, also, which he had heard read,
                    he could repeat or sing." When a Methodist bishop tried to teach him to read, Hoosier lost
                    the gift of preaching; so he gave up trying to learn to read. As he explained his talent,
                    "I sing by faith, pray by faith, preach by faith, and do every thing by faith."
                    Hoosier relied on his memory and imagination to produce flowery figures of speech and delivered them
                    with an impressive voice and bold gestures.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> He dramatized biblical stories in
                    order to impress upon his listeners the urgency of God's offer of salvation.</p>
            <p>Asbury worried about whether Hoosier could handle his fame, and it is difficult to judge whether his
                    worries were a product of racial prejudice. In the fall of 1781, when Asbury was planning a return
                    trip to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, he wrote in his journal, "Harry seems to be unwilling to go with me: I fear
                    his speaking so much to white people in the city has been, or will be, injurious; he has been
                    flattered, and may be ruined."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Was Asbury jealous of
                    Hoosier's success? Was he resentful that Hoosier wanted more control over his own ministry?
                    Whatever the case may have been, Hoosier seems to have had a talent for preaching to white
                    audiences. And one is tempted to speculate that, like black preachers of the nineteenth century, he
                    spoke about freedom and justice, doing so in covert ways to avoid provoking antagonism.</p>
            <p>One example of Hoosier's experience of racism on the road, where he had to find lodging
                    where he could, shows his resourceful- <list type="footnotes">

                    his hostess declared that "she would not hear the black." Hoosier heard the remark
                    and retired to the garden for prayer. At the service later that day, he spoke "in the most
                    humble manner" of how all people suffer from sin like a disease and how God has sent a
                    physician to heal sinners. He then lamented the possibility that some might reject the physician God
                    had sent to them that day because his hands were black. The prayer at the end of his sermon was
                    described as "awful, powerful, and overwhelming." The woman was made aware of her
                    prejudices, as were many others gathered that day.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    representative, Asbury loaned him a horse and assigned Hoosier to assist him. Coke was charmed:
                    "I have now had the pleasure of hearing Harry preach several times. I sometimes give notice
                    immediately after preaching, that in a little time Harry will preach to the blacks; but the whites
                    always stay to hear him. Sometimes I publish him to preach at candle-light, as the Negroes can
                    better attend at that time. I really believe he is one of the best Preachers in the world, there is
                    such an amazing power attends his preaching, though he cannot read; and he is one of the humblest

                    often criticized for preaching against slavery, and his outspoken views must have put Hoosier in a
                    dangerous position. Their views on grace and free will were even more threatening to many in their
                    audiences. Garrettson and Hoosier were often verbally abused and sometimes physically attacked
                    because they denied the Calvinist doctrines of unconditional election and the perseverance of the
                    saints, which were dominant among Protestants at the time. One of Hoosier's favorite
                    biblical texts was the story of the barren fig tree, which Jesus cursed when he found it had nothing
                    but leaves. Hoosier used this story to illustrate the idea that salvation should lead to good works.
                    If Christians did not show the fruit of their faith by striving to be holy, then they could fall
                    from grace and thus risk being cursed by God.</p>
            <p>Though Garrettson mentioned that some members of their audiences were rude, for the most part Hoosier
                    was well received. In his journal, Garrettson noted how the people "are amazingly fond of
                    hearing Harry." Garrettson often left Hoosier in charge of the preaching while he attended
                    to other matters. "July 29th, I rode to Hudson, where I found the people very curious to
                    hear Harry. I therefore declined preaching that their curiosity might be satisfied. The different
                    denominations heard him with much admiration, and the Quakers thought that as he was unlearned he
                    must preach by immediate inspiration."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> In <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Garrettson reports, Hoosier preached to more than one thousand people.</p>
            <p>Hoosier was on intimate terms with members of the Methodist leadership, but in many ways he remained
                    on the periphery of the church because of his race. He was, thus, both an insider and an outsider.
                    During his lifetime, he saw Methodism undergo a significant transformation. In order to accommodate
                    the growing number of people attracted by its charismatic preachers, the revivalistic movement had
                    to develop institutional and hierarchical structures. Hoosier attended the 1784 meeting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> known as the "Christmas Conference," where the Methodists, led by
                    Asbury and others, officially separated from the Episcopal Church. Because Harry was black, however,
                    he was not given a public role in that meeting.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inevitably, perhaps, the Methodists lost some of their prophetic edge regarding race and class as
                    they matured into one of the dominant institutions in nineteenth-century America. As they became
                    better established, Methodists attracted members from the higher social and economic classes.

                    good example of this change can be seen in the shift from holding open-air meetings to constructing
                    church buildings. At an outdoor revival, people of different races could mix freely, but seating
                    arrangements in church pews were more problematic. Those who supported slavery resented sitting next
                    to blacks and worshiping with them on equal terms. The blacks who formerly had been welcomed into
                    the Methodist movement had to decide whether to stay or to form their own churches.</p>
            <p>This dilemma is illustrated in the life of Richard Allen (1760–1831), whose career marks a
                    significant departure from Hoosier's. The two men certainly knew one another, since they
                    were the only blacks present at the Christmas conference, but there is no record of their meeting or
                    having been friends. Like Hoosier, Allen was born a slave. After he became a Methodist in the early
                    1770s, his master was so impressed with his piety that he was allowed to buy his freedom. Asbury
                    asked Allen to accompany him on preaching trips to the South, but since Asbury did not want him
                    mixing with slaves he suggested that Allen sleep in the carriage rather than in local homes. Allen
                    balked at this proposal. He decided instead to preach in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which had a growing population of freedmen. While Allen was recruiting African
                    Americans into the Methodist movement, white Methodists often discriminated against him, and the
                    breaking point came during a service at the Methodist church where he was a member. After an usher
                    tried to force him to sit in the balcony, Allen withdrew and founded his own church. Outspoken and
                    driven, he was an active abolitionist and a tireless worker for social justice. The churches he
                    influenced eventually became the African Methodist Episcopal Church.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unlike Allen, Hoosier chose to accept his subordinate role in a Methodist church that was dominated
                    by a white leadership. Hoosier seemed resigned that his popularity did not lead to more recognition
                    or respect. At least publicly he was able to accept the tensions of being both a servant and a
                    preacher, but privately he must have suffered many humiliations. Even the admiration he so often
                    received was frequently mixed with condescension. While Henry Boehm (1775–1875), an
                    itinerant minister, was amazed by Hoosier's abilities—"His voice was
                    musical, and his tongue as the pen of a ready writer"—Boehm also noted that many
                    people doubted that Africa could have produced such a talented man. "Some inquired whether
                    he was really black, or whether Anglo-Saxon blood was not mixed in his veins."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                    preachers. There is a record of a petition for Hoosier's ordination to the Methodist
                    bishops' meeting at the <placeName>

                    achieved this recognition.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Given his popularity, it seems reasonable to assume
                    that Hoosier's race deterred his superiors from permitting his ordination. As his career
                    came to a close, Hoosier was required to preach the gospel on an increasingly unequal basis with
                    white ministers.</p>
            <p>As a black man traveling on the road and preaching a message of equality before Gad, Hoosier was
                    subjected to many trials. As early as 1791 he was acquitted in a scandal that involved a certain
                    Sally Lyon, but there is no record of what the charges were.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Near the end of
                    his life, his situation finally began to take its toll. Hoosier became addicted to wine, which some
                    attributed to "the temptations of extravagant popularity."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                    Some cited Hoosier as an example of what happened when a black man became too famous or powerful.
                    Ironically, his duties as a minister gave him the opportunity and the duty to consume wine
                    regularly. Later in the nineteenth century temperance groups persuaded the Methodists and other
                    denominations to substitute grape juice for wine in the communion precisely because they were
                    worried about preachers and lay members alike becoming alcoholics.</p>
            <p>Whatever the cause of his decline, Hoosier had the strength of character to break this habit. He soon
                    resumed preaching in <placeName>

                    died in 1806 and "was borne to the grave by a great procession of both white and black
                    admirers, who buried him as a hero, once overcome, but finally victorious."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> He left no descendants.</p>

                    comprised of African Americans. Hoosier preached to both whites and blacks, and many whites found
                    this integration of the races to be profoundly disturbing. It is probably no coincidence that the
                    derogatory use of the term Hoosier begins to appear at the time of Hoosier's ministry. His
                    congregations were rural and unsophisticated, and they mixed the races, two characteristics that
                    would have prompted hostility and ridicule.</p>
            <p>On the Appalachian frontier the term Hoosier became slang for people who were uneducated, so
                    uneducated that they would follow a black minister. Later, as the term migrated west from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and the Carolinas to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, and then North to Indiana, it came to mean simply someone who was uncouth or ignorant.
                    As Piersen suggests, the greater number of Methodists in Indiana than in southern states helps to
                    explain how the term finally found its home. In the end, the racial connotations were gradually
                    stripped away and lost to history.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>The story of Black Harry Hoosier is worth telling for its own sake, but it also should be an
                    essential part of Indiana lore. More than most ministers of his age, Harry Hoosier was able to
                    transcend racial barriers when he preached. Those who resented his influence used his name to
                    express scorn and derision, but the people of Indiana shook off negative connotations and wore
                    "Hoosier" with pride. Without even knowing it, Indiana has preserved Harry
                    Hoosier's name; it is one that does them honor.</p>

            <p>When the Indiana General Assembly organized <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Randolph County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1818, the legislators offered no reason for choosing the name for the new county.
                    This omission has created confusion nearly two hundred years later about what or whom the
                    county's name commemorates. A careful review of the evidence, however, lends weight to the
                    idea that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Randolph County</region>
                    </placeName> was named for the <placeName>

            <p>The earliest historians to discuss the county's name were Dewitt Goodrich, who wrote in
                    1875, and Ebenezer Tucker, whose <hi rend="i">The History of <placeName>

                    "[T]he new county was named <placeName>

                    Company, Inc., Publishers, 2001. Pp. vi, 218. Illustrations, maps, appendices, notes, bibliography,

            <p>The Underground Railroad in southern Indiana is often believed to have been a system run by white
                    abolitionists, in which AfXcan Americans played a minor role. Furthermore, given the secret and
                    dangerous nature of its work, little evidence about it is presumed to have survived. To dispel these
                    and other errors, Pamela R. Peters uncovers a complex web of information surrounding the workings of
                    the Underground Railroad in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Floyd County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. While Peters is careful not to overstate her findings, she brings new
                    understanding to this greatest of all American liberation movements.</p>

                    </placeName> was well situated as a gateway to freedom for slaves escaping across the <geogName>Ohio

                    River</geogName>" (p. 5) and, equally important, a major slave-trading center. Despite the

                        <region type="county">Floyd County</region>
                    </placeName> residents, especially free African Americans, found ways to help fugitive slaves.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> that were near the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, African Americans' homes
                    offered shelter and safety from slave catchers eager for cash rewards. Free blacks who worked on

                    </placeName> Railroad found frequent opportunities to aid fugitives. Furthermore, family members,
                    churches, businesses, and Free Mason lodges connected <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and to places farther north. Using a combination of written records and oral histories,
                    Peters demonstrates that the free African Americans were "the backbone of the Underground
                    Railroad in the <placeName>

            <p>Among white <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Floyd County</region>
                    </placeName> residents, New School Presbyterians and Wesleyan Methodists were well known for their
                    condemnation of slavery. The Presbyterian <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> Theological Seminary "became synonymous with abolitionism" (p. 52).
                    Such convictions, Peters contends, linked ministers and church members to the Underground Railroad.
                    Peters raises the intriguing possibility that James Brooks, an elder of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Second Presbyterian Church, used his position as president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>–<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad to issue free train passes to slaves fleeing north. Since this railroad was a
                    reputed route for fugitive slaves and Brooks "was known for helping the poor," (p.
                    49) it seems all the more likely that he was active in the Underground Railroad. Peters also finds
                    oral traditions within <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Floyd County</region>

                    Indiana Exclusion Act of 1851, these documents gave free African Americans the legal right to remain
                    in Indiana, though it guaranteed them little else.</p>
            <p>Peters shows that <placeName>

                    those who helped liberate fellow Americans only 150 years ago and at the same time demonstrates that
                    African Americans played a leading role in this process. Finally, for historians searching to
                    unravel the mysteries of this largely hidden American drama, Peters offers new directions.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> now has a large, well-documented, and well-written history to match. George M. Logan (a
                    noted scholar of Renaissance literature) brings experience in academic life and scholarly
                    thoroughness to the task of creating a comprehensive narrative of the school's nearly
                    hundred-year history. The result is a fascinating, detailed, and readable account.</p>
            <p>With the exception of the first chapter ("Beginnings"), the book's seven
                    main divisions are named for and follow the school's fortunes through the administrations
                    of four deans (Barzille Winfred Merrill, Robert L. Sanders, Wilfred Bain, and Charles Webb). Bain
                    and Webb, who held the deanship for twenty-six and twenty-four years respectively, are given two
                    chapters each, appropriately placing their work at the heart of Logan's narrative.
                    Naturally, the history tells readers much about the school's development and growth, but
                    the book also provides a telling glimpse into the changing nature of university deanships during the
                    twentieth century.</p>
            <p>Appointed in 1919, Merrill grew increasingly autocratic. In contrast, Sanders (whose chapter is
                    subtitled "Experiment in Democracy") attempted to involve the school's
                    faculty in its governance, but as their numbers grew, decision making slowed to a crawl. Truly <pb n="53" id="VAA4025-098-1-059"/> magisterial, Bain took control of the school in 1947 and raised
                    it to unprecedented and unequaled prominence during his long tenure. The often brutal manner in
                    which Bain achieved his objectives included maintaining a penurious payroll and dismissing faculty

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Burgeoning enrollments during the postwar years (which not incidentally included
                    veterans with mature voices) enabled Dean Bain to attract a sufficient number of student musicians
                    to support large vocal and instrumental ensembles and credibly establish Indiana
                    University's Opera Theater as the chief jewel in the school's crown. With Bain at
                    the helm of the School of Music and Herman B Wells as the university's chief executive, the
                    sky was the limit, as Wells's backing of Bain was virtually unqualified.</p>
            <p>Webb took over when Bain reached mandatory retirement age in 1973. Bain expected his protege to
                    continue to do his bidding, while faculty and students looked to Webb for a welcome change from
                    Bain's dictatorship. The difficulties of deanship in an era of shared governance, rising
                    costs, shrinking budgets, and increased university administrative complexities are clear. A brief
                    postlude discusses the administration of David Woods, who was appointed dean after Webb retired in
                    1997. Confronted with a mandate for fundraising, a growing deficit, and increasing problems with
                    administration and faculty, he resigned after only two years.</p>
            <p>Logan assesses many situations frankly, though the project was tackled mainly from the vantage points
                    of administrators, faculty, and staff, and the book is clearly laudatory. Insight and documentation
                    add authority to the work's many anecdotes. Students of Indiana history and of Indiana
                    University will find that Logan has admirably shown how "the foremost American school of
                    music" (p. 5) attained its status.</p>

            <p>Since the invention of the tape recorder enhanced our ability to capture people's memories,
                    oral history has played a major role in documenting state and local history. <hi rend="i">Our Towns:
                        Remembering Community in Indiana</hi> is a welcome addition to our understanding of Indiana
                    history and of the history of community in local settings.</p>
            <p>This volume contains the transcripts of thirty-one interviews, recording the recollections of
                    thirty-nine individuals, obtained between 1976 and 1996 by thirteen different interviewers,
                    including John <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-098-1-060"/> Bodnar, the compiler of this volume and the
                    author of its introductory essay. Without intruding themselves too much in the process, the
                    interviewers skillfully elicited from their respondents a sense of what it was like to live and how
                    conditions changed in Indiana during the decades after World War I.</p>
            <p>Identifying community as the book's central theme makes sense, since it is people's
                    relationships with neighbors, fellow workers, and the groups they come into contact with that stand
                    out in the interviews. A variety of conditions surrounding community life can be observed in the
                    interviews, which deal with six different towns and cities: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Paoli in the southern part of the state, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Anderson toward the center, and Whiting and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the north. From the interviews the reader derives a picture of life in both rural
                    and urban settings. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the focus is on the black community. In Anderson, the center of attention is
                    automobile workers and the sit-down strike of 1936–1937. The automobile industry also is
                    a subject in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> interviews, but here perspectives of both workers and management are presented. Ethnic
                    communities, especially among Slovak immigrants, stand out in the case of Whiting. Residents in
                    Paoli and <placeName>

                    </placeName> discuss life in town and in the country more generally.</p>
            <p>The topics discussed in the 210 double-columned pages of text cannot easily be summarized or
                    pigeonholed. They remind us of how various, complex, and often conflicted history is.
                    People's lives differ tremendously from family to family, place to place, and time to time.
                    For some, community revolved around family and neighborhood. For others, it was school, church,
                    work, or recreation. For many, it was all of these. There is evidence here to confirm the central
                    thesis of Robert <placeName>

                    become in recent decades. Whether one emphasizes the decay of community or its continuing vitality,
                    however, collections like these provide wonderful sources of evidence for evaluating those
                    tendencies. It is to be hoped that other states will emulate Indiana in similar ventures and that
                    the Indiana Historical Society will follow up with further volumes.</p>

            <p>The story of a small-town physician who started out in local government as coroner and eventually
                    went on to serve as Secretary <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-098-1-061"/> of Health and Human Services under
                    President Reagan does not instantly engage one's attention as absorbing reading. What makes
                    it so is that the memoirist achieved one of Indiana's and, for that matter, the
                    nation's more remarkable careers in politics and government.</p>
            <p>Throughout his years as member and speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives and then as
                    governor of Indiana for two terms, Otis R. Bowen practiced the art of public service as competently
                    as he had his profession of family medicine. The Republican physician from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bremen</settlement>
                    </placeName>, known as Doc, brought to the statehouse a combination of diagnostic intelligence,
                    pragmatic treatment, and sympathetic judgment seldom found among his fellow politicians, who usually
                    came from legal, teaching, farming, and small business backgrounds.</p>
            <p>His account of his career provides a straightforward rendering of what he set out to accomplish,
                    whether he succeeded or failed (he nearly always got his way), and how he arranged the alliances
                    necessary to his purposes. There is nothing in his first-person narrative, told in a manner that
                    evokes his low-pitched, slow-talking, near monotone, that suggests excessive passion. Practically
                    everything he initiated and carried out—property-tax restraints, public health measures,
                    disaster relief efforts—was managed with much the same careful, methodical, thoughtful
                    approach.</p>
            <p>This is not to suggest that Doc Bowen recalls his career in public service as dull and plodding or
                    that his actual accomplishments were less than memorable. Whether by accident or design, he
                    presented himself to the electorate in the old-fashioned bedside manner of the country doctor who
                    regularly made house-calls (which he still did throughout his practice). This may help to account
                    for the high levels of trust and respect he consistently enjoyed.</p>
            <p>All the same, Doc Bowen reveals himself as a man of strong, even stubborn convictions and of
                    considerable pride in what he was able to get done. "As governor, I never was afraid to
                    spend for real needs. Before doing that, however, I wanted to be certain that we had been careful to
                    separate ‘wants’ from needs" (p. 120). And again: "I take
                    pride that in 1979, my next-to-last year in office, Indiana ranked fiftieth in the nation in taxes
                    collected from individuals. Mind you, we had that ranking six years after we increased state-level
                    taxes to reduce dependence on property taxes. I consider our position as a low-tax state to be
                    another of my major accomplishments as governor" (p. 120).</p>
            <p>While he is generous in expressing his gratitude to those who worked with him, Bowen can be sharply
                    critical of those who sought to defeat his policy initiatives—mostly fellow Republicans
                    such as former Indiana attorney general Theodore L. Sendak, Edwin Meese, and William Bennett. The
                    White House "minions" (as he calls them) and the federal bureaucrats he had to
                    deal with as governor and then <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-098-1-062"/> as Secretary of Health and Human
                    Services—particularly in the struggle to secure Medicare insurance coverage for
                    catastrophic illness—prompt much of his annoyance and outright contempt.</p>
            <p>Overall, Doc Bowen's reminiscences provide an instructive survey of the career and the
                    private life of one of Indiana's most effective statesmen. As a personal record, the book
                    should prove useful both to students of Indiana politics and to general readers who are willing to
                    learn something encouraging of a good life well lived.</p>

            <p>In the 1850s a group of German Pietists established the Amana Society near <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> City, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, which became one of America's more successful communal experiments. One
                    hundred and fifty years later, Abigail Foerstner, a descendant of Amana residents, has compiled an
                    impressive array of photographs of this community. The work of Bertha Shambaugh and ten Amana
                    photographers, these pictures date from the late-nineteenth through the mid-twentieth centuries and
                    reflect Amana as it changed from a communal society into a corporation of individual shareholders.</p>
            <p>In the first half of the book, Foerstner provides a history of Shambaugh, the Amana society, and the
                    Amana photographers (including her great uncle William Foerstner). Shambaugh (1871-19531, a
                    "modern woman" who attended the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, was the first outsider to photograph Amana. Impressed by several childhood trips to
                    the society, she made it the focus of her "career" as an amateur documentary
                    photographer. She published her first illustrated article on the society in 1896. Her book, <hi rend="i">Amana: The Community of True Inspiration</hi>, followed in 1908 and sealed her
                    reputation as an expert on the community.</p>
            <p>Shambaugh's significance, according to Foerstner, lies not only in her publications but also
                    in her undermining of the group's prohibition against photography, which Amana elders
                    banned as worldly. Foerstner explains Shambaugh's defiance of this order as sheer
                    "spunk" that "earned fond forbearance on the part of the Amana elders.
                    Her… sincere interest in the Amanas engendered trust, and no one wanted to deny her wish
                    to just take a few photographs" (p. 39). Shambaugh sparked an interest in photography among
                    some residents, which led to a reiteration of the ban on picture taking, but the Amana photographers
                    ignored the prohibition and began to document their own community.</p>
            <p>While Foerstner's introduction provides a needed context for the photographs, the book
                    suffers from several problems. The text <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-098-1-063"/> rambles in places and,
                    overall, lacks a scholarly basis. The few sources that Foerstner cites are generally old; she does
                    not incorporate recent scholarship on women, the Progressive era, or communal societies. Moreover,
                    Foerstner does not cite documentary evidence when discussing the lifting of the ban against
                    photography. Since the colony was making an important accommodation to the world in permitting
                    photographs, one expects a fuller explanation for the change than Foerstner provides.</p>
            <p>The most enlightening, and the most troubling, section of the book is the photographs themselves. As
                    personal and historical documents, they are priceless. They open a window for modern readers onto a
                    past that has largely been forgotten, and their historic value seems to justify the
                    photographers' defiance of the ban against pictures. Yet the photographs are also
                    bittersweet reminders of the fragile nature of intentional societies. While Foerstner views the
                    photographs in a favorable light, arguing that photography allowed Amana residents to assert their
                    individuality in a society based on conformity, she ignores the danger that such behavior poses to
                    communal groups. Admittedly one cannot explain the loss of Amana's communal basis as solely
                    the product of the group's embracing of photography, but the pictures are tangible evidence
                    of the changing values of the society and remind the reader that maintaining a balance between
                    individuality and communal identity is an issue with which every scholar, and every resident, of a
                    communal society must contend.</p>

                    Pfanz is the dean of <placeName>

                    </placeName> historians and in this work, the latest volume of his magnificently detailed study, has
                    brought to us that sensitivity, the result of a lifetime of scholarship.</p>
            <p>This book succeeds in bringing the tumultuous, often confusing fight into a focus rarely achieved.
                    Pfanz accomplishes this by layering personal accounts by participants until a coherent picture
                    emerges. There is heroism and its dark opposite, simple straightforward testimony as well as
                    self-serving grandiosity, predictable outcome interspersed with startling surprise, and all the
                    while irony and gut-wrenching tragedy.</p>
            <p>The first day of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> dawned with armies scattered and men, in small numbers at first, groping toward each
                    other, and then, <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-098-1-064"/> as the day went on, trying to kill each other
                    until there were upward of 40,000 men engaged in desperate struggle. What in ensuing years would
                    become a place of reverent memory of those who fought and died there was on that first of July, in
                    the hot sun, a swarming melee, more like a mammoth tavern brawl than an organized battle.</p>
            <p>It was the stuff of legend. Pfanz tells it all and, as is his penchant, offers his opinions on
                    long-enduring questions. Among them are why the Army of Northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> failed to follow up on its success; what caused the collapse of the Army of the
                    Potomac's Eleventh Corps; who should be credited with selecting the Cemetery Hill position;
                    what Union regiment was the last to leave the field west of the town along the Chambersburg pike and
                    railroad cut; and why the Confederate General James Archer was not supported in the morning,
                    resulting in his capture, along with hundreds of his men.</p>
            <p>Some unexpected conclusions are drawn, and the author supports them with extensive endnotes. They add
                    immensely to the quality of the book. But what stand out above all are the poignant stories of the
                    men on a summer's day long ago. In these trying times when Americans are witnessing again
                    valor borne of tragedy, they remind us that American history is made from the lives of its people.
                    One can only hope that Pfanz's fourth and presumably final volume on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>

               <hi rend="i">American Towns: An Interpretive History.</hi> By David J. Russo. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Ivan R. Dee, 2001. Pp. [xv], 350. Figures, map, illustrations, notes, bibliography,
                    index. $28.95.)</head>
            <p>Throughout much of the twentieth century, scholars attempted to capture the essence of American
                    towns. Their challenge was as much ideological as academic. Since most Americans live in cities and
                    suburbs but say they would rather live in small towns, these communities certainly occupy an
                    important and enduring place in the national ethos. In documenting the character of small-town life,
                    David J. Russo joins that long line of academicians who have sought to explain the character,
                    quality, and appeal of these distinctively American places. From the outset, Russo defines
                    interpretive history as "the <hi rend="i">patterns</hi> of life among those who have lived
                    in American towns—what connects them rather than separates them" (p. ix). This
                    book is reminiscent of historian Richard R. Lingeman's <hi rend="i">Small Town America: A
                        Narrative History, 1620-Present</hi> (1980) and geographer John A. Jakle's <hi rend="i">The American Small Town: Twentieth Century Place</hi>
                    <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-098-1-065"/>
                    <hi rend="i">Images</hi> (1982). In the twenty years since those books were published, many more
                    books and articles about American towns have emerged, and many of them are listed in
                    Russo's bibliography. He has made good use of them in his well-documented, sometimes
                    encyclopedic text.</p>
            <p>Russo's book is predicated on the supposition that the site and the design of towns are
                    important factors in setting the tone of small town life. Accordingly, he begins by analyzing places
                    in considerable detail. This technique has been embraced by many historians since at least the 1950s
                    and 1960s, when Lewis Atherton wrote <hi rend="i">Main Street on the Middle Border</hi> (1954) and
                    Page Smith completed his classic <hi rend="i">As a City Upon a Hill: The Town in American
                    History</hi> (1968). Like Smith, Russo begins with New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Although Russo implicitly uses New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> as both the source and yardstick for all subsequent town development, he does
                    acknowledge the importance of the Middle West in the pattern of American town life. He also
                    acknowledges (albeit in fleeting references) earlier Native American and Spanish antecedents to
                    American community life in some areas.</p>
            <p>Organized chronologically, <hi rend="i">American Towns</hi> treats a number of basic themes, notably
                    politics, economics, society, and culture. To achieve his goal in integrating American culture,
                    Russo cites case studies of particular places throughout the country, including several Indiana
                    communities. He makes very effective use of both primary and secondary sources. Actually, even
                    though the word "interpretation" appears in the title and is the stated goal of
                    this book, it is description at which Russo excels. This is not an underhanded compliment: although
                    description is often denigrated by academicians, it is indeed an art—and clearly an art
                    that Russo has mastered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">American Towns</hi> ends with a brief (seven pages) synopsis of the town in myth and
                    reality. Russo concludes that "[tlhe impulse for Americans to live in or locate their
                    activities in small local communities was still a vital one" in the late twentieth
                    century—even though "most people, most activities, and most institutions were
                    situated in fast-spreading urban settings" (p. 296). This is not startling news for those
                    who know the American psyche: for more than a century, Americans have praised small towns while
                    moving away from them—much as many praise hardship as a builder of character while
                    avoiding it at all costs. Although Russo does not fully explain why such a longing for small towns
                    persists, he does help us better understand how towns develop(ed) and function(ed) as part of our
                    collective past. Overall, <hi rend="i">American Towns</hi> is a solid synthesis of a remarkably rich
                    literature, told in a refreshingly straightforward manner.</p>

            <p>Richard P. Mulcahy argues that the United Mine Workers of America's creation of a retirement
                    and welfare fund was a major breakthrough for coal miners and the labor movement and that it played
                    a pioneering role in both inaugurating and terminating the social contract between major labor
                    unions and employers in the post-World War II era. Responding to pressure from union members, John
                    L. Lewis placed health care and pensions at the top of his collective bargaining agenda with the
                    Bituminous Coal Operators Association in 1946. The defeat of a proposal for a national health care
                    system and the issuance of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> report, which documented the inadequate medical care available to rural Appalachian
                    coal miners, increased the urgency of this demand.</p>
            <p>Using a variety of sources, especially fund files, Mulcahy analyzes the formation of a new
                    relationship between the union and coal operators. Their social contract was based upon union
                    acceptance of mechanization and a reduced labor force in exchange for high wages, medical benefits,
                    and pensions. He emphasizes the health care component of the fund, especially the initial
                    extensiveness of the benefits and their later curtailment as medical costs skyrocketed. In addition,
                    Mulcahy notes the opposition of the American Medical Association, especially some of its state and
                    county affiliates, which feared the fund's emphasis on group practice, retainer fees for
                    doctors, and quality care at low costs.</p>
            <p>He praises the vision of Lewis and Josephine Roche and the skills of the professionals who
                    administered the fund. They are credited both with creating an innovative physical rehabilitation
                    program and with establishing clinics and a network of hospitals. However, the fimd suffered
                    setbacks in the 1960s as W. A. (Tony) Boyle replaced Lewis as the union president, a new generation
                    of coal company executives saw royalty payments to the fund as a threat to their competitiveness,
                    and coal miners complained about reduced benefits and restricted eligibility. Nevertheless, both
                    medical coverage and pensions continued into the late 1970s, when the 1978 contracts provided health
                    care through private insurance programs purchased by employers.</p>
            <p>The book is most valuable as a detailed description and analysis of the rise and fall of the health
                    care component of the fund. Mulcahy adeptly depicts the difficulties that its implementers faced,
                    describes the benefits derived from it by coal miners and their families, and notes how the fund
                    fits into the social contract system of coal industry labor relations policy. The pension aspect
                    receives less attention, and Mulcahy neglects the role played by this issue in the coal <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-098-1-067"/> strikes of the 1980s and 1990s. His favorable assessment of Lewis and
                    his very critical depiction of Arnold Miller and his appointees differ from the evaluations of other
                    specialists. Presentation of the fund story in a wider context would enrich its meaning. The fund
                    was formed during a time of labor ferment, including a strike wave in 1946, attempts to establish
                    economic democracy, and the negotiations by Walter Reuther for a contract for auto workers that
                    included wage increases, health care coverage, and pensions. The demise of the health care system of
                    the United Mine Workers coincided with increasing competition for unionized coal production from
                    western coal fields, from domestic oil and natural gas production, and from imported fuel.
                    Nevertheless, this book is a valuable institutional study of the health care aspect and should join
                    Ivana Krajcinovic's <hi rend="i">From Company Doctors to Managed Care: The United Mine

                    Donnelly. (College Station: <placeName>

                    bibliography, index. $34.95.)</head>
            <p>The mobilization of the National Guard during the Korean War remains something of an enigma in
                    American military and social history. William M. Donnelly closes a huge gap in National Guard
                    history with this exhaustively researched book. The author uses a wide variety of sources, in
                    particular command reports, correspondence, and newspaper coverage of the units he selected as
                    representatives for each of the guard's three Korean War missions.</p>
            <p>This work contributes to several areas of scholarship. Most significantly, while previous historians
                    have focused on the relatively few units actually sent into combat—and Donnelly does not
                    neglect these units—he also recognizes that "most Army National Guard units
                    mobilized during the Korean War did not deploy overseas—instead they remained in the Zone
                    of the Interior" (the continental U.S., where they served as home guards or training units)
                    or were federalized and sent to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> as reinforcements against a possible Soviet attack (p. 147). Donnelly excels in his
                    treatment of these previously neglected units.</p>
            <p>Mobilization problems of the guard and reserve have often been ignored by historians, but not in this
                    case. Donnelly looks closely at administrative, personnel, equipment, and training problems that
                    systematically plagued all federalized National Guard units, regard- <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-098-1-068"/> less of the mission to which they were assigned. For example, one of
                    the most pressing issues was created by the guard's recruiting slogan, "GO with
                    those you know." Designed to foster unit cohesion and esprit, the slogan was quickly
                    ignored as units, especially those that were not deployed to <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName>, were often required to levy troops. The author also discusses racial integration in
                    the federalized units, though only as an aside. Donnelly is critical, and with good reason, of the
                    guard's overall mobilization plan and its lack of adequate training facilities for the
                    large number of units that were ordered to active duty.</p>
            <p>Donnelly addresses the social implications of the activation of the guard, both for the individual
                    guardsmen and for their families and hometowns. He explores issues such as the morale of units
                    activated but not sent to <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> and the real and perceived inequality in the army's treatment of guardsmen
                    (officers in particular) and provides insight into the lives affected by the mobilization, the
                    consequences of which were obviously different for guardsmen than for people already on active duty.</p>
            <p>Readers looking for information on Indiana National Guard units will no&amp; find it here, as
                    the author makes only a few references to postmobilization training at Camp Atterbury for some
                    units. For a look at Indianans' participation in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> readers should consult Randy K. Mills and Roxanne Mills's <hi rend="i">Unexpected Journey</hi> (2001), which deals with the Marine Corps Reserve unit from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Overall, Donnelly accomplishes his goal of treating objectively the entire National Guard
                    mobilization for the Korean War. The publication is timely in view of our current defense posture
                    and heavy reliance on the guard and reserve. While this book fills a void in National Guard history,
                    there remains substantial unexplored territory. Based on this book, one hopes that Donnelly will

            <p>Of all the wars ever fought by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, few, if any, rival the Korean War in intensity, brutality, and unpopularity. From 1950
                    to 1953 American and United Nations forces often battled superior numbers of North Korean and
                    Chinese troops in a harsh mountainous terrain marked by extreme weather variations—fiom
                    summers that featured scorching heat and oppressive humidity to winters with <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-098-1-069"/> sub-zero temperatures. In a three-year period over 54,000 Americans
                    lost their lives, a figure nearly equal to the total number of American deaths incurred over some
                    ten years of battle in North <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>. Still, the Korean conflict largely remains "the forgotten war."
                    Despite major works by <placeName>

                    </placeName> Blair, Joseph Goulden, John Toland, and others, it continues to rank among the least
                    understood and least remembered chapters in American history.</p>
            <p>Helping to remedy this situation is a superb new study by Randy K Mills and Roxanne Mills, <hi rend="i">Unexpected Journey: A Marine Cop Reserve Company in the Korean War.</hi> It is a
                    chronicle of C Company, Sixteenth Infantry Battalion, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Indeed, as the authors suggest, the contributions of Marine Corps reservists
                    (originally hailed as "the Minute Men of 1950") were "unique in the
                    annals of American warfare" (p. xiii). Summoned to active duty in the late summer of 1950,
                    often after receiving only weeks of combat instruction (they were promised a training period of six
                    months), these raw recruits received their baptism under fire in the savage fighting in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Because of the downsizing of U.S. armed forces after World War II and the deteriorating American
                    military situation by the autumn of 1950, these young reservists (many of whom were teenagers) were
                    rushed into the front lines. Uprooted from families, wives, and children, they were soon engaged in
                    a bitter, life and death struggle thousands of miles from home, the purpose of which, they believed,
                    was to stop the worldwide spread of Communism. With great skill and a gripping narrative, the
                    authors walk us through a series of ferocious engagements, including Chosin Reservoir, Inchon, and
                    several "hills" that were merely assigned numbers.</p>
            <p>The Millses describe the soldiers' weariness and growing disenchantment with the ensuing
                    bloody stalemate following the massive Chinese intervention of November 1950 and the largest retreat
                    in American military history, to the Thirty-eighth parallel. Throughout the book, but especially in
                    chapter seven, the authors analyze developments on the "home front." The final
                    chapter discusses the experiences of the survivors and their difficulties in adjusting to peacetime
                    life. Like the veterans of the more publicized North <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> conflict, these Korean War veterans underwent nightmarish flashbacks and bouts of
                    depression—and many found solace and healing only decades later through reunions with
                    fellow reservists.</p>
            <p>Culling information from diaries, letters, newspapers, magazines, and from interviews with the
                    participants, the Millses have produced a first-rate monograph that serves as a microcosm of the
                    Korean War. Readers may take issue with a few points, such as the authors' contention that
                    the rapid demobilization after 1945 was a mistake. While it may have been flawed as a foreign policy
                    strategy, as domestic policy, it was surely not a mistake: given the pressures on President Truman
                    to "bring the boys back home," it is difficult to <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-098-1-070"/> see how military downsizing could have been denied. Also, the book
                    might have profited from a Mler discussion of the Truman-MacArthur controversy. Surely,
                    MacArthur's proposals for dropping between thirty and fifiy atomic bombs on Chinese cities
                    and for laying down radioactive waste along the Yalu River threatened not only to widen the war but
                    to invite World War III and a nuclear holocaust. Still, <hi rend="i">Urnpected Journey</hi> is an

            <p>In the 1960s the Democratic party, torn asunder by the North <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> War, civil rights, and urban crime, came under ideological assault by the New Left and
                    the New Right. According to journalist Rick Perlstein, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName>'s Senator Barry Goldwater launched a libertarian, free-market revolution
                    against the "liberal consensus." <hi rend="i">Before the Storm</hi> is a
                    sympathetic account of Goldwater's war against "the liberal consensus"
                    that libertarians and leftists found so distasteful, because it represented the marriage of New Deal
                    social welfare concerns and support for labor unions to the post-World War II effort to contain
                    Soviet expansion.</p>
            <p>Perlstein is an engaging writer. His description of Notre Dame law school dean and conservative
                    activist Clarence Manion is vivid: "His [Manion's] forehead seemed to get bigger
                    each year, as if to make room for yet one more set of facts and figures on the Communist conspiracy,
                    forcing the droopy ears, doughy cheeks, protruding lower lip, and picket-fence teeth to crowd ever
                    more tightly at the bottom of his face" (p. 10). Perlstein's discussion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> publisher Eugene Pulliam, the grandfather of Dan Quayle, is just as fascinating.</p>
            <p>While Perlstein indulges his fondness for old groaners—"Rockefeller funds kept
                    the nation's Negro colleges in the black (p. 54)—his account of the quirks of
                    southern politics is worthy of Wilbur Cash (p. 46). In one of this reviewer's favorite
                    passages, discussing <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Orange County</region>, <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
               </placeName>, and the rise of the John Birch Society
                    (established in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1958), Perlstein provides an amazing quote from U.S. Representative James Utt, who
                    "likened the federal government to a ‘child molester who offers candy before his
                    evil act’" (p. 125).</p>
            <p>Perlstein underscores the hypocrisy of southwestern libertarians who decried big government while
                    eagerly accepting military defense contracts and federally funded irrigation and highway
                    construction projects. Tellingly, during the Great Depression <placeName>

                    </placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName> $342 million while the state contributed just $16 million in
                    taxes.</p>
            <p>There are a few matters that Perlstein might reconsider. Perl-stein equates the GI Bill of Rights
                    with welfare, forgetting that World War II veterans had performed a service in kind to the nation.
                    Then, paradoxically mirroring the complaints of Rush Limbaugh, Perlstein berates those recipients of
                    the GI Bill who became Republicans, implying that the Democrats had bought their votes and that they
                    should have remained bought.</p>
            <p>Most problematic is Perlstein's treatment of the Cold War, where he places the onus for the
                    conflict on Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy. Perlstein also dismisses fears of domestic Communist
                    subversion as right-wing paranoia. He should have taken seriously the works of John Earl Haynes,
                    Harvey Klehr, Richard Gid Powers, and Ronald Radosh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Before the Storm</hi> is an invaluable book that maps out the New Right's
                    crusade against the New Deal order. When one considers the ferocity of the New Right and New Left
                    cadres, it is little wonder that the order did not hold. In defeat, Goldwater sowed the seeds for
                    Ronald Reagan's presidency, just as George McGovern prepared the way for Bill Clinton.</p>
