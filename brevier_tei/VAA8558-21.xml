        <head rend="center">BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS--PROSPECTUS VOL. XXI.</head>
        <p>The particulars of Legislative expenses for the extra session of 1872, itemized in the
          Specific Bill approved Dec'ber 21,1872, justifies our statement that the Legislature found
          the cost of the newspaper subsidies for legislative reports in this city to exceed that of
          the authentic <hi rend="i">Brevier</hi>.-- The cost of newspapers for that session above
          that of the <hi rend="i">Brevier Legislative Reports</hi> was $356.73. The newspaper
          vanished, but the <hi rend="i">Brevier</hi> is extant with all its contributions to
          history.</p>

        <p>The Legislature finding that the cost of their newspaper subsidies exceeded that of the
          authorized B<hi rend="sc">REVIER REPORTS</hi>, the subsidy was cut off by the act of
          December 19,1872, By that act the newspaper became justly and legally recognized as but
          "stationery" for the people and their representatives, and, by implication, as unfitted
          and unworthy to be intrusted and authorized at the public expense as the depository of
          their solemn legislative records. </p>

        <p>The <hi rend="i">Brevier Reports</hi> have done for the people what the newspapers are
          unfit and unable to do in the matter of a just and stern legislative record; and the work
          has been done cheaper than the newspaper charges which have been paid out of the treasury
          for their partial, personal, restricted and unreliable matter called "Legislative
          Proceedings.</p>

        <p>The B<hi rend="sc">REVIER REPORTS</hi> contain a record that is impartial,--not a single
          partial report can be found in any one of the twenty volumes issued.</p>

        <p>The B<hi rend="sc">REVIER</hi> Reporters in the 24 years of its publication have been
          careful chiefly to make their work here a good record,and rest its claims to the
          cherishment of the Legislature upon that alone. They have gone before no Committee,
          lobbied none, received no approaches for individual favor, nor shaped their work at any
          time with sinister or partizan objects. It has rested solely and all the time on its
          merits, its integrity and its fairness; and for these it has all the time received the
          favoring notice of the Legislature. </p>

        <p>As compensation should always be regulated by the skill required, there can be no
          question but that the pay for service but few are competent to perform should largely
          exceed the pay for labor that many are able to do. These <hi rend="i">Brevier
          Reports</hi>, in each page, contain more than three times as much matter as there is in
          one page of the Supreme Court Reports,yet the Brevier Reports are furnished to the state
          for two-thirds of a cent a page, while the Reporter of the Supreme Court has received
          three-quarters of a cent per page, besides the copy-right. </p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-The fifty Districts being full-there being fifty Senators
            present-I now declare a quorum present and ready for the transaction of the first
            business before the Senate, which is the election of a principal secretary. Nominations
            are now in order.</p>

          <p> Mr. SPANN-Mr. President: For Principal Secretary of the Senate I put in nomination
            Robert C. Sears, of Vermillion County.</p>

          <p>Mr. COMPTON--I place in nomination Robert J. Kelley, of Vigo County.</p>

          <p>There being no further nominations the first ballot resulted for Mr. Sears 22 votes for
            Mr. Kelley 28 votes. </p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-Mr. Kelley having received a majority of all the votes cast, I
            declare him elected Principal Secretary of the Senate. Mr. Kelley will please come
            forward and receive the oath of office, [which was administered by Judge Wood]</p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-Nominations <pb n="10" xml:id="VAA8558-21-009"/> are new in
            order for Assistant Secretary of the Senate.</p>

          <p>Mr. HENRY-I nominate Charles F. Bobbins, of Marion County. </p>

          <p>Mr. WILLARD-I nominate Henry C. Huffstetter, of Lawrence County, for Assistant
            Secretary of the Senate.</p>

          <p>There being no further nominations the ballot resulted as follows:</p>

          <p> For Mr. Hufstetter 28 votes, for Mr. Bobbins 22.</p>

          <p>Mr. Hufstetter was declared elected and sworn by Judge Wood. </p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-The next in order is nominations tor Doorkeeper of the Senate. </p>

          <p>Mr. BROWN nominated Vincent P. Kirk, of Marshall County. </p>

          <p>Mr. BUNDY put in nomination Henry L. Gordon, of Franklin County. </p>

          <p>Twenty-eight Senators having voted for Mr. Kirk and twenty-two for Mr, Gordon. </p>

          <p>Mr. Kirk was declared elected and sworn into office.</p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-I will appoint James W. Woodrum, and Henry Neltzer; of Putnam
            County, and Bertie Hollis, of Greene, as Pages. The Senate is now organized and ready
            for any business that may come before it. </p>

          <p>Mr. BROWN offered a resolution that the rules of the last regular and special session
            Senate be adopted for the government of the proceedings of the present session until
            further ordered with the exception that the words "President of" in line two of Section
            8 be stricken out. </p>

          <p>Mr. BUNDY-Offered a substitute providing that the rules adopted at the last session be
            the rules for the government of the Senate at this session. </p>

          <p>Mr. BROWN-The resolution I offered is not intended, of course, to cast the slightest
            reflections on the Chair. I certainly have not any idea, nor has any Senator, to my
            knowledge, but that the Chair would exercise the greatest impartiality in the selection
            of these Committees, did the Senate intrust that duty to the Chair. In fact, the only
            reason I have, as far as personal reasons are concerned, is that the Chair does not
            reside in my camp. The Democratic party being in the majority, it will be responsible
            for the business done in a great degree, and it should have control of the composition
            of the Committees. </p>

          <p>Mr. BUNLY-While I concede all the Senator from Jackson (Mr Brown) has to say in regard
            to the Democratic party being in the majority, I do not consider, if the Committees were
            made by the President of the Senate, that anything would occur, either upon a report
            made by any Committee appointed by the Chair or otherwise, where the majority would not
            have the same right and the same power to do ss they please. I offer the substitute
            because I believe the President of the Senate is entitled by precedent and by courtesy
            to appoint these Committees. I believe it is his right, and that is the reason why I
            offer it. Of course, the substitute may be voted down, but I believe it is proper and
            right to offer u and give the brethren on the other side an opportunity to vote for it
            If they want to, </p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN the sub as laid on the table-yeas, 28; nays, 22-and the original
            resolution was adopted by the same vote. </p>

          <p>On motion the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR appointed Messrs. Marvin and Sayre a Committee to
            inform the House of Representatives that the Senate is organized and ready to proceed
            with legislative business. </p>

          <p>Mr. BROWN asked and obtained unanimous consent to introduce a bill [S. 1] for an act to
            provide for the better government and management of the benevolent institutions, and to
            repeal Sections 2,768, 2,769, 2,856, 2,857 and 2,869 of the Revised Statutes of 1881,
            which was read the first time, and 150 copies were ordered printed.</p>

          <p>Mr. SPANN moved that the bill be referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>
            when appointed. </p>

          <p>Mr. BELL suggested if there be any real question upon which this bill ought to go to
            the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> it can go there after it comes from the
            Committee where it properly belongs.</p>

          <p> Mr. SPANN-It seems to me this is a very important bill, and may overturn the laws
            already upon the statute books for the government of these institutions, and I desire it
            shall be referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, with instructions to
            report to this Senate the status this bill will leave these institutions in </p>

          <p>The motion was rejected-yeas. 22; nays, 28.</p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN the bill was referred to the <orgName>Committee on Benevolent
              Institutions</orgName>, when appointed.</p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. VOYLES it was ordered that when the Senate adjourn it be till 10
            o'clock to- morrow morning.</p>

          <p>A message from the House of Representatives by S. W. Edwins, principal Clerk thereof,
            informing the Senate of the organization of that body, and that it was ready to proceed
            with legislative business, was read by said principal Clerk, when the Lieutenant
            Governor said to him, "You win please privately inform members to appoint a Committee of
            two to inform the Senate of that matter." [Laughter.]</p>

          <p>Mr. WHITE moved that a Committee of two Senators be appointed to act with a like
            Committee tee on the part of the House of Representatives to wait upon the Governor and
            inform him of the organization of the two houses;, and learn of him at what time it will
            suit his convenience to make whatever communication he may desire. </p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-This is not in order until we are notified of the organization
            of the House of Representatives. </p>

          <p>Mr. MARVIN-I have the honor to report that Senator Sayre and myself waited upon the
            House of Representatives, were recognized by the Speaker and reported to him that we
            were there by order of the Senate to report that the Senate was organized and ready for
            business. </p>

          <p>Mr. FOULKE obtained leave to introduce bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_002">S.
              2</ref>] to enable Turnpike Companies in this State to connect with turnpike roads
            operated in an adjoining State, which was read the first time and referred to the
              <orgName>Committee on Roads</orgName> when appointed. </p>

          <p>Mr. SPANN offered a resolution that, in all cases, when a bill shall bs reported from a
            Committee, with a recommendation that it do pass, that 150 copies of such bill shall be
            printed for use of the Senate.</p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. BELL it was amended by adding the words "when so recommended by the
            Committee." On motion by Mi. BROWN the resolution a amended was laid on the table.</p>

          <p>A message from the House being announced by the Doorkeeper, two Representatives
            appeared and one of them said: We are a Committee from. the House of Representatives,
            instructed to present the following resolution: </p>

          <floatingText>
            <body>
              <div type="resolution">
                <p>Resolved, That a Committee of two, on the part of the House, be appointed to act
                  with a similar Committee, on the part of the Senate, to wait upon the Governor and
                  ascertain when he will make a communication to the General Assembly. </p>
              </div>
              <!-- end Resolution -->
            </body>
          </floatingText>

          <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR suggested this was an unusual course and proposed another. </p>

          <p>Mr. MARVIN thought either way correct. The Senate two years ago did exactly as the
            House has done. Sometimes the Senate sent a Committee and sometimes it sent a Secretary. </p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-It is this way: The Senate appointed a Committee to wait upon
            the House and notify the House that the Senate was ready for business, and the House
            should send a Committee to the Senate to notify us that the House is ready for
            business.. [Sotto voce, he charged the Committee to notify the House of this manner of
            proceeding, which caused much merriment and laughter.] </p>

          <p> Mr. GRAHAM offered a resolution that a Com<pb n="11" xml:id="VAA8558-21-010"/>mittee
            of five be appointed by the President of the Senate to report at the earliest possible
            moment the names of Senators who shall constitute the standing Committees of the
            Senate.</p>

          <p>On motion of Mr BROWN it was laid on the table-yeas, 28; nays, 22.</p>

          <p>And then the Senate adjourned, under the order heretofore adopted, until 10 o'clock
            to-morrow. </p>

          <p>Mr. HEFFREN placed in nomination Hon, Wm. D Bynum, of Marion County. </p>

          <p>Mr. FRAZIER nominated Hon. A. J. Wright, of Grant County. There being no further
            nominations, the vote resulted for Mr. Bynum 57 votes, for Mr. Wright 41 votes. </p>

          <p>Mr. Bynum having received a majority of all the votes cast, was declared by the Chair
            duly elected Speaker of the Fifty-third General Assembly.</p>

          <p>The SECRETARY of STATE appointed Mr. Moody and Mr. Wright as a Committee to escort the
            newly-elected Speaker to the Chair. </p>

          <p>Mr. BYNUM spoke as follows: </p>

          <p>"Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:</p>

          <p>" I thank you for the honor you have conferred upon me by selecting me to preside over
            your de- liberations. I regret that I do not bring to the position that legislative
            experience so necessary to a prompt and efficient discharge of the duties. I promise
            you, however, that I will strive to obtain a perfect knowledge of the rules which may be
            adopted for our government, and. when so obtained, shall endeavor to enforce them
            impartially. I am cognizant of the fact that no presiding officer can successfully
            discharge the duties of his position without the unqualified support of all the members
            of the body over which he has control. I shall endeavor to so con- duct myself as to
            merit not only your support, but also your confidence and esteem. If I am successful I
            have no fears but what I shall receive them. The time allotted to us in which to trans-
            act the necessary business of the State is short; yet by diligent labor we can and we
            ought to com<pb n="12" xml:id="VAA8558-21-011"/>plete our work within the regular
            Constitutional period. The mistake, if it can be called a mistake, of the last
            Legislature was in the enactment of many laws upon important subjects without due
            consideration. The people are seldom, if ever, profited by hasty and inconsiderate
            legislation. It has been truly said that the unforeseen far out number the foreseen
            consequences of the law, If this be true of well prepared and well matured decisions by
            the most acute legal minds, what may we expect at best from statues enacted by a
            legislative body in the brief period of time fixed by our Constitution? We can avoid the
            errors and escape the censure of former Legislatures by confining our labors strictly to
            matters of necessity and importance. Whatever laws we may pass should be duly considered
            and well understood before hand. It is certainly gratifying to us all that, after so
            many contests, within and without these halls, we meet to legislate for the interests of
            the State, without any important or exciting political questions to distract our
            thoughts or disturb our deliberations. Under such circumstances we out to be able to
            accomplish our labors with credit to ourselves and with satisfaction to our
            constituents." </p>

          <p>Mr. GIBSON nominated S. W. Edwins, of Madison County, for Principal Clerk.</p>

            that this House do now adjourn.</p>

          <p>Mr. HEFFREN moved that the House take a recess till 2 o'clock-there is no use in
            fooling away a half day.</p>

          <p>A MEMBER-A resolution has been passed that when we adjourn it will be till 10 o'clock

          <p>The SPEAKER-This is a motion for a recess. The question is on the adoption of the

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT moved to take from the table the resolution authorizing the appointment of
              a Committee to inform the Senate of the organization of the House. He was sure the
              Senate had taken a wrong step, and the House should not recede from its action. </p>

            <p>Mr. STEWART was at a loss to know how the House can inform the Senate it is organized
              other than by sending a message to that effect by its Clerk. If the Senate does not
              received him, how are we to inform the Senate of our organization? He knew no good
              reason for taking the resolution from the table.</p>

            <p> Mr. JEWETT did not think the House, on a mere question of dignity, should fritter
              away a <pb n="13" xml:id="VAA8558-21-012"/> day or two. He could see why a gentleman
              presenting himself at the door of the Senate. claiming to be a Clerk of the House,
              should be able to identify himself. We are compelled to take notice of persons
              constituting the Senate of Indiana, and so is the Senate compelled o take notice of
              persons constituting the House. The action of the Senate can not be deferred on the
              plane of common sense. Somebody in the Senate has made a worse mistake than we have in
              the House. Let us go to business rather than pursue a policy more like schoolboys than
              legislators and men.</p>

            <p>Mr. ANTRIM-The mistake lies not in the action of the House. The House authorized its
              Clerk to notify the Senate that the House was organized. The Senate failed or refused
              to receive our communication. It was not a communication from the Clerk, but a
              communication from the House through its Clerk. We have clone all we can do. The
              Senate refuses to recognize our messenger. It is responsible for the delay, and the
              House is not. </p>

            <p>Mr. FRAZTER-The Senate has refused to receive a notification from. The House
              announcing: our organization. There is but one way provided in the joint rules by
              which messages may be transmitted between the two Houses. There is no rule under which
              the Senate can send a message to the House by a member of this House. Somebody told
              our Committee to say something to the House. We have nothing but hearsay that the
              Senate has refused to accept our message as delivered by the Clerk. He made the point
              of order that the proper motion is to reconsider, and not to take from the table. </p>

            <p>The SPEAKER decided the point of order not well taken.</p>

            <p>The pending motion to take from the table was lost-yeas 43; nays, 44.</p>

            <p>Pending the roll call-</p>

            <p>Mr. A. W. BROOKS, of Allen, and Mr. B. S. GREEN, of Dubois and Martin, appeared at
              the bar of the House and were sworn in by the Speaker.</p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT offered a resolution for the appointment of a Committee of three to inform
              the Senate of the organization of the House and that it is ready to proceed with
              Legislative business. </p>

            <p>A MEMBER desired the Clerk to state his action in the matter, and what the message
              contained.</p>

            <p>By consent Mr. Clerk Edwins said: I went into the Senate Chamber, proceeded to the
              rear of the Chamber, and had the Doorkeeper or Sergeant-at-Arms announce a message
              from the House as usual. I addressed the President of the Senate, and read the message
              in the following words: "Mr. President-The House has instructed me to inform the
              Senate that they organized by the election of Hon. W. D. Bynum, of Marion County,
              Speaker; S. W. Edwins, of Madison County, Principal Clerk; H. B. Frey, of Grant
              County, as Doorkeeper, and is now ready to proceed to legislative business.</p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL-That is the substance of the resolution now offered, and I don't see the
              necessity of doing over again what we have done.</p>

            <p>On motion of Mr. ANTRIM the resolution was laid on the table upon a division-
              affirmative, 55; negative, 33, as reported by Messrs. Jewett and Wilson, of
              Kosciousko, Tellers appointed by the Speaker. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN introduced a bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_001">H. R. 1</ref>] for an
              act appropriating $125,000 to defray the expenses of the regular session of the
              Fifty-third General Assembly of Indiana, and other matters connected therewith. Which
              was read the first time, and under dispensation of the constitutional restriction
              requiring bills to be read on three several days, was read the second time by title
              only, the third time by sections and finally passed the House of Representatives-yeas,
              93, nays 2.</p>

            <p> Mr. McMcullen offered a resolution that the Speaker appoint a Committee of five to
              report the number of appointees as well as by whom appointed.</p>

            <p>It was laid on the table. </p>

            <p> Mr. KIRKPATRICK offered a resolution, which was adopted, that the thanks of the
              House be tendered Hon. 0. M. Wilson for services rendered in assisting in the
              organization of the House of Representatives. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN-It is necessary that we have the Revised Statues. I am informed that they
              are on hand, and I move that the Secretary of State be requested to furnish members of
              the House with one copy each of the Revised Statues, to be returned to the Librarian
              at the expiration of the session.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

            <p>Mr. MONTGOMERY offered a resolution reciting that whereas there are a great many
              persons anxiously awaiting the action of the General Assembly with regard to the
              election of officers in its gift, resolved, that a Committee of three be appointed by
              the House and a like Committee by the Senate to fix a time for such election in the
              near future.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. HEFFREN it was laid on the table. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT offered a resolution that this House has learned with sincere regret of
              the death of Hon. H. S&gt; Perrette, a member elected to this House from the County of
              Floyd, and said:</p>


            <p>"I will not detain the House at any length, but it seems to me proper that something
              should be said when the House is about to take action in memory of the death of one of
              its members. Very few members had met him. His death occurred under more than
              ordinarily distressing circumstances, from the fact that the wife of his youth until
              within two weeks of his death was in the full flush of life. Yet she was stricken
              down, and he returned from her grave with the grasp of death in his ame. And his death
              was the more pitiful from the fact that he left three small children, the oldest of
              which is an inmate of the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb. He was a man with a career not
              marked with any great public service, but he was a useful citizen and trusted friend.
              It was my painful pleasure, if such an expression may be allowed, to attend his
              funeral, and I never saw love manifested in a greater degree by the people of his
              neighborhood than at his burial. I move that this resolution be passed by a rising
              vote.</p>

            <p>The resolution was so adopted.</p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN-As a further mark of respect to the deceased I move that the House do now
              adjourn.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

            <p>And so the House adjourned till to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock under the rule.</p>

          <p>It was referred to the <orgName>Committee on Rules</orgName>. </p>

          <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS offered a resolution requesting the Secretary of the Young Men's
            Christian Association to procure a minister of the Gospel to open each day's session
            with prayer. </p>

          <p>Also a resolution making 2 o'clock Thursday, January 11, an hour for appropriate
            tributes to the memory of Hon. George H. Chapman, late a Senator from Marion County.</p>

          <p>They were severally adopted. </p>

          <p>Mr. YANCEY offered a resolution for a Special Committee on Woman's Suffrage</p>

          <p>Mr. BELL moved to lay the resolution on the table. </p>

          <p>This motion was agreed to by yeas, 27; nays, 21. </p>

          <p>Mr. Brown offered a resolution for the appoint anent of a Select Committee of Five, of
            which the Lieutenant Governor shall be a member, to report rules for the government of
            the proceedings of the Senate. </p>

          <p>Mr. SPANN made an ineffectual motion-yeas, 4; nays, 4-to lay it on the table.</p>

          <p>The resolution was adopted.</p>

          <p>Messrs. Brown, Spann, Graham and Bell were appointed by the Lieutenant Governor as said
            Committee.</p>


          <p>The Committee appointed to wait on the Governor reported that His Excellency would
            deliver his message to the General Assembly this morning.</p>

          <p>Mr. FOULKE offered a resolution to amend rule 8, by providing for a <orgName>Committee
              on Judicial Proceedure</orgName> which was referred to the <orgName>Committee on
              Rules</orgName>, on his motion.</p>

          <p>Mr. SMITH offered a resolution requesting the Secretary of State to furnish a copy of
            official record in his office concerning proceedings of the General Assembly on the
            Constitutional amendment proposed in 1881, and also in relation to the Wabash and Erie
            Canal amendment, and certify whether the records in the adoption of other amendments
            show that the Constitution was complied with in this provision : "Such proposed
            amendments shall, with the proceedings thereon, be entered on their journals and
            referred to the next General Assembly."</p>

          <p>Mr. WILLARD made an ineffectual motion-yeas, 23; nays, 26-to lay the resolution on the
            table, as in his opinion it proposes to interfere with the rights of the
              <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. He then moved to refer it to the
              <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>

          <p> Mr SMITH: I hope the resolution will not be referred to the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName>. I apprehend the Senate is as well qualified now to pass upon the
            resolution as it will be after the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> shall have
            considered it. This resolution was intended to be, and is nothing else but a demand or
            request of the Secretary of State to furnish certain facts upon which we can act
            intelligently and understandingly when this question shall be sprang upon the Senate, as
            it undoubtedly will be. There is nothing else intended, except to procure this
            information from the Secretary of State. I apprehend that I occupy the same position
            that other Senators do upon this floor I am wholly ignorant of the acts of the
            Legislature on this question, and we can only procure the information from the Secretary
            of [ State's office either by passing this resolution or going to that office and
            personally examining the records for ourselves. I can not see why Senators oppose this
            proposition, especially as the information sought for is necessary in order to act
            intelligently on a proposition that will in all probability come before us in some form,
            concerning the proposed amendments acted upon last session; and it is rumored that upon
            a clerical error that matter is to be defeated. </p>

          <pb n="15" xml:id="VAA8558-21-014"/>

          <p>Mr. BROWN: I am opposed to that resolution, and will state one or two reasons why I am
            opposed to it. I have no objection to its going to the <orgName>Judiciary
              Committee</orgName>, if the Senate so please, but to my "mind the resolution is
            useless. All that the Secretary of State can possibly do will be to hunt up the journals
            of the two Houses on the days when the proceedings referred to in the resolution tools:
            place, and send to the Senate a certified copy of the matter printed in those journals.
            Those Journals are open to the Inspection of every man, woman and child in the State. If
            the Senator is ignorant about the matter it is his own fault and nobody else's. Shall we
            then put a duty upon the Secretary of State to send out that which is a public record of
            the State lodged in the archives of every County in the State? But as the Senator from
            Delaware [Mr. Smith] has said, it has gone out in the land that this amendment is to be
            defeated upon some technical ground, I will say that I agree with the Senator from
            Marion (Mr. Van Vorhis] on this subject. The Constitution requires proposed amendments
            to that instrument to be spread at large upon the journals. Is any man so blind that he
            can not see whether that has or has not been done by taking up those journals and
            examining them"</p>

          <p>[A message from the House by Chief Clerk Edwins informed the Senate that the House was
            ready to receive the Senate in Joint Convention to hear the Governor's message to the
            General Assembly]</p>

          <p>Mr BROWN [resuming]: Now on the question as to whether the amendments are legally on
            the Journals or not, the Legislature is the exclusive judge-its decision is final. No
            Court can review t. If the Legislature decides that their amendments have not been
            entered at large upon the journals, that is the end of it. If the Legislature decides
            they have, that is the end of it. So we should not attempt to run away from meeting the
            main proposition as suggested by this resolution. And it would be charging the
              <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> with an unnecessary burden. </p>

          <p>Senators then left their 'hanaber.in a body and proceeded to the Hall of the House of
            Representatives, to hear the Governor's biennial message to the General Assembly.] </p>

          <p>When the Senate returned to its chamber the Senate took a recess (till 2 o'clock p. m. </p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
            <p> A message from the House of Representatives announced the passage by that body of
              the bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_001">H. R. <choice>
                  <sic>5</sic>
                  <corr>1</corr>
                </choice></ref>] appropriating $125,000 for the expenses of the present session of
              the General Assembly.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. BELL the Constitutional rule requiring all bills to be read on three
              several days was set aside-yeas, 43; nays, 3-the bill read the first and second times
              by title only, the third time by section, and finally passed by yeas, 45; nays, 3,
              with an amendment by unanimous consent adding an emergency clause and an amended
              title.</p>

            <p> The Senate resumed the consideration of the resolution pending at the noon
              recess.</p>

            <p>Mr BELL objected to the resolution because it proposes to call for an opinion from
              the Secretary of State as to the legality of the action of the last Senate on the
              proposed Constitutional amendments. I do not think this is the time to discuss that
              question. As far as I am concerned personally, whenever that question comes before the
              Senate I propose to act as a man and as a lawyer-especially as a lawyer-and if
              convinced that the action of the last General Assembly was regular and legal, no one
              will say so more promptly than myself, notwithstanding lay opinion on some of these
              amendments. And even if they had not been so fixed I would easily take that position.
              If the resolution be amended so as to call for no opinion, for one I should have no
              objection to it. I think it premature to discuss the other question now, I think it
              one of the highest importance, entitled to our best consideration, and I have no doubt
              it will receive it. I think there is much in this bill that ought not to be there. I
              hope that tho Senator will leave out all that refers to the Wabash and Erie Canal, and
              for one I would like to have the question of the pending amendments to the
              Constitution. and the regularity of their passage by the last General Assembly comes,
              up unicumbered by any other question, whatever. Let us meet it like men, I pledge
              myself to fairness in its consideration, and I have no doubt other Senators will meet
              the question in the same spirit.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to amend by striking out all after the words or figures " 1881." </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE: I am opposed to the amendment as offered by the Senator from Jackson [Mr.
              Brown]. This matter of the certification of these papers is a matter of paramount
              importance, if we may judge by the intensity of feeling shown on both sides, and by
              the entire people of this State. It is of more importance than any matter which has
              been before the General Assembly of Indiana for many years. It is true, this is a mere
              Parliamentary question, but to a proper determination of how we shall act in this
              matter, it is necessary to have documents and papers, both as to the law and as to the
              facts. As to the facts, we must get everything necessary to the certification of the
              proceedings had at the last General Assembly, and as to whether or not those
              proceedings were fatal, it is necessary to know what the law is and it is proper to
              know what has been the former practice as to amendments proposed to the Constitution
              of this State. It is true the custom does not make law, but legislative interpretation
              as to the passage of such amendments is certainly a good argument in the consideration
              of this question. It seems to me we should have everything before us. I am not willing
              that the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> shall determine whether or not this
              matter is properly before us. Let each Senator determine that for himself. We should
              judge of these things by the highest evidence we can get.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD: It seems to me we will have a <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>,
              which will examine carefully all legal questions which may be presented to the Senate
              during the session. That Committee will have an opportunity to look into this entire
              matter, and when it makes a report the information that the Senator from Wayne [Mr.
              Foulke] desires will be made a part of that report. If that Committee shall desire any
              information from the Secretary of State, or from any other officer, they have it in
              their power to ask for the passage of a resolution requiring it to be furnished; and
              we should not now, in advance of the formation of that Committee, usurp to a certain
              extend the powers of that Committee. When it comes to investigate this question, their
              report will bring to the Senate every particle of information, I trust, that can be
              obtained from the records of the State. </p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES: The design of the Senator from Delaware [ Mr. Smith], as I read his
              resolution, is to obtain not only a certified copy of the proceedings in relation to
              the Constitutional amendments, but also an opinion from the Secretary of State on that
              subject. I do not know why he should seek an opinion on that subject, unless it be to
              give him an opportunity to carry out some of his former pledges. I am reliably
              informed that he was invited to give his opinion on those amendments during the last
              canvass, and he said he was formulating his opinion and in the due time would
              promulgate that opinion. It may be that the Senator from Delaware desires to give him
              and opportunity to promulgate his opinion. But aside from that, I think we can get at
              the facts without reference to anyone' opinion on the legality or standing of the
              amendments. I think the proper way will be to refer the resolution to the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. </p>

            <pb n="16" xml:id="VAA8558-21-015"/>

            <p>Mr. SPANN: It seems to me that there can be but one object with Senators on the other
              side of this Chamber in urging that this resolution be referred to the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. If referred to the <orgName>Judiciary
                Committee</orgName> it means simply that it shall never reach the Secretary of
              State's office. The <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> will be made up of a
              majority of members from the other side, who will simply say, we do not desire any
              certificate from the Secretary of State to settle any question, we will simply report
              that it is inadvisable or inexpedient to hear from the gentleman known as the
              Secretary of State, and consequently if this resolution goes to that Committee it will
              sleep the sleep of death. I am glad to know that the Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown]
              in his eloquent remarks this morning in slopping over, lead us to believe that they
              expect to carry out the platform made in the last campaign to kill the temperance
              movement at the first stage, and this is the first step to refer this resolution to
              the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> and there kill it.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL: I regret that this question is being forced upon us as a political
              question. Neither do I know by what authority the Senator from Rush [Mr. Spann] states
              what the action of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> will be. My object in
              having this resolution go to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> is, they being
              lawyers, will know what information is necessary in order to pass intelligently upon
              this question, and I hope they will not find it necessary to involve it with others,
              but present the bold, bare question, and present it fairly and squarely. I have no
              opinion u Don it, because I am not conversant with the facts. </p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL: I am unable to comprehend why the simple resolution that the Senator
              has offered should be regarded as in any sense partisan, neither can I comprehend why
              It should have any reference, directly or indirectly, to the sentiments of any member
              of the Senate on the temperance question; neither do I understand that the resolution
              asks, directly or indirectly, the opinion of any body. It asks for documents to be
              placed on our desks that we may know exactly the wording of the records, as we have a
              right to know. I do not see that this vote should have any partisan bearing whatever.
              I understand the object of sending any paper to a Committee is for the purpose of
              having the opinion of that Committee in regard to the validity of such paper or
              proposed action. The resolution asks for no action except the transmission to us for
              the perusual a simple public record. I apprehend no Senator questions the validity of
              such transmission, and that nobody doubts but that we have a legal right to ask that a
              copy of such records may be spread before us. Then why should the resolution be sent
              to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>? I am opposed to a submission of this
              question to a Committee because I believe it is plain that we don't need any light
              from such a source.</p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE: I am opposed to leaving it to the discretion of any Committee as to
              whether The Senate shall have sufficient data for its investigations, and that is what
              this proposition is. Are we to have full and complete data for our investigation as to
              whether these amendments are before us or not? I see no reason for submitting it to
              the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, unless it be to stifle this matter.</p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH: In the Introduction of this resolution I had no idea of causing this
              debate. There is nothing in it but to request the Secretary of State to furnish
              certain information. It asks no opinion. I would not be willing to respect his
              opinion, because it is no better than that of any Senator on this floor. Senators have
              gone into a discussion of the Constitution and other things not connected with this
              matter. The question before the Senate is upon the reference of the resolution to the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. I am opposed to that reference for two
              reasons. First, there is nothing in it for the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>
              to consider. There is not a legal or constitutional question in it. And, in the second
              place, we would not get a re- turn of it, I fear, in the form of a report from that
              Committee in time for the information asked to benefit us. Now, I move to lay the
              motion to re- fer to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> on the table. </p>

            <p>This motion was rejected-yeas, 21; nays, 27.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY moved to amend the motion to commit by adding instructions to report not
              later than Wednesday.</p>

            <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>

            <p>The motion as amended was also agreed to.</p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL offered a resolution instructing the Secretary of State to place on the
              desk of Senators a copy of the Revised Statutes, and take a receipt therefor from each
              member accepting a book, with the understanding that the copy shall be returned at the
              expiration of the member's term of office. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. SPANN it was amended by by providing that the books shall be
              returned at the expiration of this Session.</p>

            <p>The resolution as amended was adopted. </p>

            <p>Mr; HILLIGASS offered a resolution requiring the Superintendent of Public Instruction
              to furnish a statement of the total amount of money unloaned school fund in the
              several Counties of this State. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. BUNDY it was referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>
              when appointed. </p>

            <p>Mr. WHITE offered the following:</p>

                    use of the Senate Chamber for transacting of the business of the Senate; and on
                    requisition of the Senate Chairmen of the Standing Committes be furnished for

            Excellency was now ready to deliver his biennial message to the Legislature. On his
            further motion the Clerk was directed to invite the Senate to a joint Convention
            instanter for the purpose of hearing said message, and a Committee of two was appointed
            to conduct the Senate to the hall of the House.</p>

          <p>It was adopted. </p>

          <p>The SPEAKER announced the Committee on Rules, authorized by the resolution of the
            gentleman from Washington, adopted yesterday morning, to wit': Messrs. Heffren, Wilson
            of Marion, Wright, Moody and Frazee.</p>

          <p>The House then took a recess till after the Joint Convention.</p>

          <p>The Senate appeared, preceded by the House Committee of escort. The Lieutenant
            Governor, seated on the right of the Speaker, called the Convention to order, Governor
            Porter then delivering his message as follows: </p>

          <p>Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives : The circumstances under which
            you assemble could not well be more satisfactory. The condition of the State has never
            been more prosperous. During the year just ended the products of our fields have been
            unusually abundant. Our manufacturing and mining industries have yielded good returns.
            Within the last year 560 miles of railway nave been built within the State-a larger
            number than in a any previous year. Of the ninety-two Counties in the State, there are
            only four through which railroads do not pass, and three of these happily border on the
            Ohio River. More than 225,000 acres of land have, during the year, been brought for the
            first time into cultivation. The practice of underdraining soils charged , with an
            excess of moisture has never been so energetically prosecuted. Along with it has come
            increased productiveness and a lessening of all malarial diseases. Our common schools,
            under the careful (superintendence of a diligent and capable officer, have increased n
            usefulness and in public favor. </p>

            <p>This amount, it will be perceived, falls considerably below the estimate for
              1882.</p>

            <p> The estimate required by law to be made by the Auditor of State to the General
              Assembly at each biennial meeting, of the expenditures to be made from the Treasury
              for the ensuing two fiscal years, can not, of course, anticipate all the expenditures
              which may prove to be necessary. There are always in the case, even items included in
              his estimate, appropriations which exceed the sums estimated, and there are always
              appropriations for other proper and necessary objects which naturally could not be
              foreseen when the Auditor's estimate was made. A chief purpose of the Auditor's
              estimate is to enable the Legislature to perceive within what limits other
              disbursements must be confined. In order to avoid the necessity of a higher rate of
              taxation. When appropriations, however, have been made by the Legislature in excess of
              sums estimated, or for objects not included within the estimates, it is proper that
              they shall be brought to public attention, in order to undergo a fair public scrutiny. </p>

            <p>It will be perceived that the receipts to the general fund from all sources during
              the fiscal year 1881 and 1882 have fallen short of like receipts during the fiscal
              year 1881. The receipts to the general fund in 1880 were $1,477,609 92, and in 1882
              were only $1,260,401 64, falling off of $217,208 28 during the latter year. The cause
              of this decrease is as follows:</p>

            <p> The appraisement of all taxable real estate in this State was, prior to the passage
              of the statute of 1881, required by law to be made once in five years. The last
              appraisement was made in 1880. The next preceding one was in 1875, when the prices of
              real estated were yet inflated. The appraisement of 1880 fell below that of 1875
              $155,424,597. The assessed value of personal property in 1880 was also less than 1879
              by $54,223,545. None of the taxes levied under this lower assessment were payable to
              the State Treasurer until in May, 1881. At that time half of the State taxes for 1880
              were required, by law, to be paid into the Treasury. The other half was not required
              to be paid into the treasury until January, 1882. The taxes collected for the fiscal
              year 1881 were one-half collected under the high valuation of real estate made in
              1875, and one-half under the lower valuation of 1880. The taxes for the fiscal year
              1882 were all collected under the lower valuation of 1880. </p>

            <p> The taxes received into the General Fund of the State Treasury in 1881, fell short
              of the taxes receive to 1880, for the reasons above stated, $42,175 33, and in 1882
              fell short of the taxes received in 1880 $158,063 97.</p>

            <p>For the last fiscal year the State Government has had to be conducted on less revenue
              than for several years preceding.</p>

            <p>Although, however, no new appraisement of the real estate will be made for purposes
              of taxation until the year 1866. the great increase of personal property has begun to
              be apparent of the tax lists, and by 1884 will probably have swollen the total value
              of taxables to as high an amount as they have ever been in any recent period of the
              State's history.</p>

            <p>In addition to the revenues of the State will be apparent hereafter by the higher
              appraisement of the State Board of Equalization, during the years 1881 and 18S2, of
              the right of way and other property of Railway Companies The enlarged earnings of
              these Companies were deemed to justify an average increase to the extent of 10 per
              cent. in the valuation of property returned by them for taxation. n addition to this
              increase there has been an increased assessment, through the vigilance of the Auditor
              of Scale, by securing an assessment of buildings and improvements, such as machine
              shops and other expensive structures, situated on what the Courts have interpreted to
              be the "right of way" of these Companies, which, since 1872 had for the most part
              escaped taxation. The revenue, however, from the taxation of such buildings and
              improvements would be still further augmented, without an infliction of injustice, by
              a requirement that they shall ba appraised by local officers in the Townships in which
              they ara situate. The State Board of Equalization can never ascertain their value with
              satisfactory accuracy. </p>

            <p>Under a loose interpretation given to our statute concerning Voluntary Association,
              the State's revenues from Insurance Companies are being diminished, and an injury is
              being inflicted upon many communities by irresponsible and fraudulent Insurance
              Companies, from other States and at home, which are engaged in the transaction of
              business under the shelter of that enactment. These Companies have so far afflicted
              the business of sound and responsible Companies, doing a fair and legitimate business,
              and honestly paying their taxes, as seriously to diminish their earnings and to make
              some of them contemplate a withdrawal of their agencies from the State. There is need
              for a prompt adoption of such, measures as will put a stop to fraudulent and
              speculative schemes which, sheltering themselves under the law of the State, inflict
              great injury upon our citizens and bring reproach upon the State itself. </p>

            <p> The average daily number of inmates in the Hospital for the Insane, during the last
              fiscal year, was 1,070. The average cost per capita for maintenance, exclusive of
              clothing, is stated to have been $184,97.</p>

            <p>The number of pupils at the Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, at
              the end of the last fiscal year, was 344. The average daily attendance is not given in
              the reports. The cost per capita is stated to have been $156.32,</p>

            <p>The number of pupils enrolled at the Institute for the Education of the Blind, during
              the fiscal year, was 126, The reports do not give the average dally attendance. The
              cost per capita is stated to have been $216.67. </p>

            <p>The number of pupils at the Soldiers' Orphans' Home and the Asylum for Feeble Minded
              Children, institutions under one roof and one government, is stated in the
              Superintendent's report to have been as follows: Soldiers' orphans present at the end
              of the fiscal year, 137. Twenty other orphans are accounted for by the
              Superintendent's statement that three have "eloped," and that seven teen have failed
              to return after the summer vacation. Of feeble-minded children, eighty-one pupils are
              reported as having <pb n="19" xml:id="VAA8558-21-018"/> been present at the end of the
              fiscal year, and fourteen as discharged or away temporarily. The latter fourteen are
              said, in the Trustees'report, not to have returned from the summer vacation. The cost
              of maintenance is stated by the Superintendent to have been $125 per capita. The
              average daily attendance is not specified. </p>

            <p> The two last named institutions are not, with respect to the reports required of the
              Trustees and Superintendent, governed by the statute relating to the other benevolent
              institutions The statute does not define with the same particularity what the reports
              shall contain. Nor does the statute relating to any of chem define the mode of
              determining the cost per capita of maintain their inmates. An examination of the
              reports of the several institutions will, I think, snow that a uniform rule of
              ascertainment does not prevail, and that the mode of ascertainment In one or two of
              them, quite unintentionally no doubt, is untrustworthy. </p>

            <p>I recommend that a common requirement be adopted with respect to what shall be shown
              in the reports of the Trustees and Superintendents of the several institutions, and
              that the manner in which the cost per capita of maintains the in mates shall be
              ascertained, shall be specifically defined by law. </p>

            <p>Your attention is respectfully invited to the recommendations contained in the report
              of the Trustees of the Hospital for the Insane, and which are strongly reinforced in
              the able and instructive report of the Superintendent of that institution. </p>

            <p>The capacity of the buildings erected by the State for the care of the insane,
              spacious and imposing as they are, is sufficient for little more than half of the
              State's insane. Those who are unable, for lack of room in the State's Hospital, to be
              admitted as patients, suffer great and often cruel, neglect. They are confined in
              uncomfortable and sometimes shocking quarters in Poor Houses, where they received
              insufficient attention, or they are a burden upon poor kindred who are unable to make
              adequate provision for them, and to whom they are a source of distressing anxiety. and
              often of danger. Or provision for the insane is so inadequate that it falls quite
              below the provision made for the same class of sufferers by neighboring States. The
              mode suggested by the Superintendent for enlarging hospital accommodations is
              commended to your earnest consideration. </p>

            <p>The provision contained in our statues for ascertaining the number of insane, deaf
              and dumb, blind and idiotic persons is imperfectly executed. Township Assessors are
              charged with the duty of ascertaining, at the time of assessing personal property, the
              number of such persons in their respective Townships; but this requirement is so
              frequently neglected that these lists furnish very imperfect information. A specific
              penalty should be prescribed for a neglect to perform this important duty. </p>

            <p> The clause in the revised code which provides that a summons against an insane
              person who has no guardian shall, where such person is confined in a Hospital, be
              served upon the Superintendent, is regarded generally by the legal profession as not
              being applicable to writs of summons issues in divorce cases, and against
              administrators and guardians in the course of the settlement of estates. The
              consequence is that inmates of the Insane Hospital are often greatly excited and their
              recovery retarded by a personal service upon them of writs. This clause of the statute
              should, it would seem, be made to include all writs of summons in civil proceedings. </p>

            <p>I recommend that in the department for women in this Hospital it shall be required by
              law that at least one of the physicians shall be a woman. There are now in this State
              not a few women who bear diplomas from respectable Medical Colleges, and who are
              qualified by professional attainmen's and experience to fill places as physicians in
              public institutions with credit and usefulness. It would be peculiarly fit that their
              services should be sought in cases of insanity among members of their own sex. </p>

            <p>Three claims of considerable magnitude are pending against the State for work and
              materials under contracts entered into the Provisional Board of the Insane Hospital,
              it being the Board charged by law with the duty of constructing the building for the
              department for women. Two of the claims have been refused. One has been allowed by a
              compromise with the contractor, subject to a condition that the Legislature shall make
              an appropriation for its payment, there being now no appropriation available for that
              use. The facts relating to the case, briefly stated, are these: The Provisional Board
              advertised for bids for the brick work of the building, the work to be executed and
              paid for according to the plans and specifications of the State's Architect. The
              specifications provided for a measurement of the work in the wall as the work
              progressed, according to the rule of mason measurement of work in the wall, then in
              use in Indianapolis. The bid of the claimant, John Martin, was accepted. Before,
              however, a formal contract had been entered into with him, the State's Superintendent
              of Construction, himself a member of the Board, desired that what were the rules of
              mason measurement of brick in the wall at Indianapolis should be precisely defined in
              the contract, requested the claimant to allow a clause to be inserted providing that
              the measurement contemplated should be according to the printed rules of the master
              builders and contractors for brick work in this city. The clause having been inserted,
              the contract was reported to the Board and signed on behalf of the State by Governor
              Hendricks, the President, and by every other member. Before the allowance to the
              claimant was made, for which he will ask an appropriation, the work was carefully
              measured by the State's architect and by two experts especially appointed by the Board
              for that purpose, and their several measurements having agreed, the allowance was made
              in conformity thereto. </p>

            <p> It is perhaps due to Mr. Martin to state that in a report made to the Governor by
              the Superintendent of Construction, when the work was nearly completed, he referred to
              his work as having been prosecuted diligently, and in the most satisfactory manner,
              and added that he felt it due to Mr. Martin to make a public record of the fact that
              he had "from the beginning manifested a constant, active and earnest interest in his
              work, with evident purpose, that it should be an honest job, creditable to the State
              as well as to himself." </p>

            <p> The capacity of the Institute for the Education of the Blind is now insufficient for
              the accommodation of more than half of the blind youth, who, by law, are entitled to
              the benefits of the Institution. The edifice was completed for the admission of blind
              pupils more than thirty years ago, and has never been enlarged. Applicants are
              constantly refused admission to the Institution on account of the want of rom.
              Provision should be made by law for an enlargement of the building. </p>

            <p>The Soldiers' Orphans' Home and Asylum for Feeble Minded Children should be regarded,
              on account of the character of both classes of pupils, with particular favor. It has
              had to struggle under the difficulty of narrow appropriations, and, during a party of
              its history, with other difficulties hardly less serious. The instructors have,
              however been diligent and devoted to duty, and the progress of pupils has been highly
              satisfactory. The soldiers' orphans have been particularly proficient in their
              studies, and the success attained in unfolding and strengthening the faculties of the
              feeble minded children has been most <pb n="20" xml:id="VAA8558-21-019"/> encouraging.
              A sufficient appropriation should be immediately made to provide additional securities
              against fire. The means of escape in case of a sudden fire are wholly inadequate.
              Outside stairways at the outer end of the main halls should be erected as soon as
              possible; and, as the building is already furnished with gas pipe, a gas generator
              should be erected so as to supply the building with a safe light for illumination, so
              that the use of oil lamps may be discontinued. </p>

            <head rend="center">PENAL AND REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS.</head>
            <p> Your attention is particularly invited to the report of the House of Refuge for
              juvenile offenders. The average number ot inmates during the year ; was 350. The
              expense of providing the equipments and instructors requisite for teaching the boys in
              this institution the most useful manual occupations has been found too great, in the
              opinion of past Legislatures, to warrant in making the necessary appropriation. A boy,
              as the case now is, though instructed in the simpler braches of education, leaves the
              Institution, in most cases, little better fitted to earn a livelihood, so far as
              manual skill is concerned, than when he entered it. He is to apt, on that account, to
              fall back into a life of crime. A system of industrial education has recently found
              much favor, which, not professing to teach manual trades, gives boys a dexterity in
              handicraft which maybe equally useful in many different trades. It instructs them in
              the use of what, it has been said, are the "half dozen universal tools," viz : the
              hammer, saw, plane, chisel, file and square. It is said that "in all the constructions
              a certain number of typical forms are found, which, being more or less modified, adapt
              themselves to special cases. These forms will also shape themselves into groups, each
              to be worked out in a certain way and with special tools; and the student taught to
              work out these forms each in the best way and with the tools best suited for the work
              will be far advanced in the skill which will make him available and useful in
              construction." A boy instructed in this way in a knowledge of forms and acquiring
              aptness and dexterity in the use of tools, would leave the Institution with a feeling
              of capability and self-confidence; could more readily obtain employment, and could
              speedily qualify himself for almost any of the various lucrative trades. One teacher
              it has been found can instruct thirty-two students at a time in this system, and boys
              going through the exercises in separate classes at different times, the education can
              be imparted with very little cost either in implements or materials. I invite your
              attention to the schools that at Boston, St. Louis and elsewhere, have recently
              entered upon this new system of industrial education for indigent boys, and to the
              propriety of such legislation as will give it a fair trial in our House of Refuge. </p>

            <p> Under the guise of committing children to this i institution as incorrigible, or as
              juvenile offenders, children are often sent to it by the Courts who are simply poor,
              or whose parents, desiring to get rid of the cost of care of rearing them, are willing
              to make them a charge upon the State. Children merely poor should not be allowed to be
              thrown into association with juvenile offenders, and the sternest; vigilance should be
              practice to prevent negligent parents from shifting upon the State the responsibility
              of maintaining and rearing their offspring. Besides, it is not possible to ascertain
              to what extent the class of boys intended to be received into this Institution are
              reformed, if children not criminal or incorrigible are admitted. Sufficient provisions
              should promptly be made by law against the abuse of admiting boys not belonging to the
              classes of criminal and incorrigible. </p>

            <p> The recommendation of the Superintendent that boys released from the Institution
              upon tickets of leave shall be placed by law under the surveillance of the Township
              Trustees in the Counties to which they are sent, seems to be a most judicious one. A
              knowledge by boys thus released that their conduct was watched by persona of
              character, for an honest purpose of preserving their morals, would help to restrain
              them from returning to crime. The additional advantage would also be gained that if
              they should fall again into a profligate life they could promptly be returned to the
              Institution for further discipline. </p>

            <p>The management of the Reformatory for Women and Girls deserves unqualified
              commendation. A desire to keep expenditures within the limits of appropriations and to
              administer the Institution with proper economy, has been constantly evident. The
              proportion of inmates who, after their return to their homes, lead correct lives is
              greater than the most sanguine might reasonably have expected. </p>

            <p>There is reason for regret that in selecting a site for the Reformatory more regard
              was not had to convenient facilities for sewerage. The only means for conveying the
              sewerage from the building is by the current of a rivulet that, after passing through
              the grounds, runs through a populous part of Indianapolis. With all the care that can
              be exercised, and an exhaustion of all means of purification, complaints are made of
              offensive odors. The stream, after passing through the grounds of the Reformatory,
              runs in part through and in part near the edge of the United States Arsenal grounds,
              and persons there employed have induced the authorities at Washington to cause a suit
              to be instituted in the United States Circuit Court at Indianapolis to enjoin the
              Trustees from allowing the sewage to be conveyed through said stream. </p>

            <p> Nothing but a belief that the present Legislature will, by a proper law, provide for
              building a sewer by which the waste from the Reformatory will be carried off by other
              means than said stream has, it is believed, prevented an allowance of an injunction.
              Provision by law for the construction of a proper sewer is imperatively necessary.</p>

            <p> An act was passed by the last General Assembly providing for the construction of
              such a sewer at the joint expense of the State and city of Indianapolis; but, as the
              consent of the city to bear its proportion of the outlay was requisite before the work
              could be undertaken, the work fell through, the city not having given the needed
              consent. As the sewer will be of material benefit to the city, it is just that it
              should bear a due proportion of the expense. </p>

            <p> The necessity for a walled enclosure for the purpose of allowing a space for needful
              exercise for women sentenced for crimes whom it would be unsafe to permit to be at
              large upon open grounds is evident, and an appropriation of the comparatively small
              amount asked for by the managers would seem to be most proper. </p>

            <p>The State's Prisons at Jeffersonville and Michigan City are more nearly
              self-supporting than they have been for several years. </p>

            <p>The average number of prisoners at the former Prison during the past year was 564.
              The average number of prisoners at the Prison of Michigan City was 621.</p>

            <p>The specific appropriation bill which failed at the last session of the General
              Assembly, on account of its consideration having been deferred to too late a period of
              the session, contained an appropriation of $5,000 for building special wards at the
              Prison of Michigan City, for the use of insane prisoners, and for a transfer to that
              Prison of all insane prisoners in the Prison at Jeffersonville. I earnestly urge the
              appropriation of a proper sum of money for the building of cells at the former Prison
              for insane prisoners, which shall be remote from the cells of other convicts. The
              insane convicts are at present, for want oi any other provision, kept in cells so near
              those of <pb n="21" xml:id="VAA8558-21-020"/> other prisoners that their cries at
              night disturb and frequently destroy the rest of these hardworked men, whose condition
              at the end of each day's labor requires that they should have undisturbed repose. It
              is cruel and discreditable to require prisoners deprived night after night
              successively of needful sleep, to perform the laborious, daily tasks demanded of them
              by the practice of the Prisons. Insane persons require also a very different attention
              from that given to the sane, and from that which necessarily they are now accustomed
              to receive.</p>

            <p>The abbreviation of the terms of sentences allowed by statute to prisoners for good
              conduct is believed not to be sufficiently liberal. No incentive to good behavior is
              found to be so strong with them as a knowledge that such behavior will shorten the
              term of imprisonment. I earnestly recommend legislation giving to prisoners whose
              conduct has been continually exemplary, a larger credit for good conduct on their
              sentences. The effect of such legislation would be followed, I have no doubt, by a
              great improvement in discipline, and a lessening of expense in the conduct of the
              Prisons.</p>

            <p>Complaint is made by the city authorities of Michigan City that the sewage of the
              Prison at that city, which is conveyed into a small stream called Fish Lake Creek,
              occasions a nuisance injurious to the health of the inhabitants. The growth of the
              city has recently been rapid, and its limits now extend beyond the point at which this
              refuse is conveyed into the stream. The necessity for the construction of a sewer by
              the State seems to be urgent. </p>

            <p>The number of persons in the State of School age, viz., between the age of six and
              twenty-one years, is 709,424. The number admitted to the schools was, in 1882,
              498,792. The average daily attendance of pupils last year was 30,513. The number of
              school teachers is 13,259. The number of school houses in the State is 9,556, of which
              forty-eight are log, eighty-three are stone, 2,481 are brick, and 6,944 are frame. </p>

            <p>The amount of Public Fund is $9,138,408.31. The addition made to it annually taking
              as a basis an average of the pest five years, exceeds $54,000. This sum does not
              include the large sum-about $260,000 a year-received from particular licenses and
              other sources, and applied each year to tuition. </p>

            <p>The amount of tuition money derived from interest on the school funds in 1882 was
              $650,173.41. The whole amount received from State and local tuition taxes was
              $2,059,616.44. The proportion of the entire expense of tuition paid from taxes, State
              and local, was 75 per cent.</p>

            <p>It will thus be seen that, ample as our school fund is, three-fourths of the expenses
              of tuition are derived from public taxes. The fact that these taxes are paid without
              complaint, is the highest evidence of the esteem in which the Public School system is
              held.</p>

            <p>The report of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction is replete with
              interesting facts and suggestions.</p>

            <p> The State Normal School is shown, by the report of the Trustees and Superintendent,
              to be in a highly flourishing condition. The average number of students during last
              year was 302. The need for a moderate appropriation for the purchase of apparatus for
              the instruction in the sciences is urgent.</p>

            <p>The important suggestions contained in the reports of the Trustees of the State

            <p> The State Board of Agriculture has shown commendable zeal during the past year in
              the discharge of its official duties. It is required by law to hold a meeting in the
              month of January of every year, together with the delegates from the several County
              Societies, for the purpose of deliberation and consultation respecting the "wants,
              prospect, and condition of agriculture throughout the State." At this meeting reports
              from the County Societies, required to be made annually, with regard to the condition
              of agriculture in the several Counties, are delivered, pursuant to law, to the
              President of the State Board. It was doubtless the expectation of the framers of the
              statute that these County reports would furnish the chief basis for the deliberations
              and consultations of the Board relating to the condition and prospects of agriculture
              in the State. If filed a proper time before the January meeting they doubtless would
              but not baing delivered until after the meeting has begun, they can not be examined
              during the meeting with any care, and therefore form no basis for consultation or
              deliberation. The consequence is that they are, as a general rule, hastily prepared,
              contained little varied or specific information, and fall to present with fullness or
              vividness the condition of agriculture in the Counties. </p>

            <p>If the reports were required to be delivered to the Secretary of the State Board by
              the 1st of December of each year, and it were made his duty to present to the Board at
              its January meeting a copious abstract of their contents, and to arrange and index
              them so that the several subjects could be readily referred to they would soon form a
              basis for the deliberations and discussions of the Board, and their quality would be
              greatly improved. It would be good policy for the State to offer a reasonable premium
              annually for the best County report. This would excite emulation, and in the end would
              make these reports of much value to our farmers.</p>

            <p>Some of the professors of Purdue University-the State's Agricultural College-devote
              the greater part of every year to studies and experiments in agriculture. If these
              particular professors were made members of the State Board, they would impart much
              freshness and interest to its discussions, and give to it increased energy and spirit.
              I recommend that two members of the Faculty of Purdue University be made ex officio
              members of the Board. </p>

            <p>The number of coal mines in the State is 150. The number of miners employed in them
              is 5,100. The production exceeds 2,000,000 tons a year. </p>

            <p>The law in relation to coal mines, through carefully framed, is believed to need some
              amendment in order to give proper security to the lives of miners. The State Inspector
              is a practical miner of long experience, and thoroughly acquainted with the needs of
              miners. Hempen ropes for hoisting are, in his opinion, unsafe in cases of fire.
              Besides, no ordinary inspection can detect with certainty secret defects which often
              render them unreliable. Steel wire ropes should be required to be substituted in their
              place. Every mine, in the Inspector's opinion, should have at least two outlets. Where
              a furnace is employed for the purposes of ventilation, and one of the outlets i used
              for the escape of smoke and steam, the outlet so used is useless as a means of retreat
              in case of sudden danger. A mine in this condition has practically but one outlet. An
              additional one should, in such cases, be required. </p>

            <p>It is made the duty of the Mine Inspector to examine all scales used in any coal mine
              for the purpose of weighing coal taken out of the mine, Miners are usually paid by the
              ton for their work. Justice to them and the preservation of harmony between them and
              their employers require that correct scales shall be used. The State, however, not
              having provided the Inspector with sealed weights, he has no accurate means of
              determining satisfactorily whether scales are correct. The <pb n="22"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-021"/> State should provide him with a set of sealed weights.

            <p>The General Assembly, at its special session in 1881, enacted a law providing for an
              appointment by the Governor of a Commissioner of Fisheries Commissioners had
              previously been appointed, under provisions of law, in thirty-one States of the Union
              and two of the Territories. I appointed to the office a gentleman who had given much
              study to the habits of fishes and to their propagation, and had been specially
              successful in the cultivation of the carp. I invite your attention to the suggestions
              contained in his report. The law of 1881 seems to have been intended rather to set on
              foot an intelligent investigation into the best means of restoring our many fishing
              streams, and of preventing a renewal of the reprehensible practices by which they have
              been impoverished, than to provide an efficient plan for supplying these streams, or
              to prevent a wanton or thoughtless depopulation of them. The business of fishing, if
              our fishes were undisturbed in the spawning season would soon become a profitable
              industry, and would give employment to many citizens. A most wholesome and nutricious
              food would soon be made abundant. The temperature of our streams and lakes, and their
              purity, adapt them to a great variety of fishes. The black bass, which multiply so
              rapidly when their spawning grounds are undisturbed, that artificial propagation is
              never necessary, is native to our streams. The carp can be successfully and
              inexpensively cultivated. It has been described by Professor Baird, United States Fish
              Commission- er, as being emphatically a farmer's fish. On account of requiring little
              more care than his swine and poultry. If Indiana has lagged somewhere behind a
              majority of her sister States in providing for restocking her nearly numberless
              streams and the beautiful lakes which abound near her northern border, shall she not
              make up for time neglected by a prompt adoption of the best methods, by the passage of
              wise protective laws, and by a resolute spirit on the part of her inhabitants to
              secure their enforcement ? </p>

            <p> Attention is called with pleasure to the energetic and successful efforts of the
              Adjutant General to increase the numbers and improve the discipline of our active
              militia. The encampment held at Indianapolis last summer, at which some of the most
              prominent militia companies of the country engaged in a competition for prizes with
              our own companies, and with one another, drew to it a vast number of interested
              spectators, gave a renewed impulse to the martial spirit, and has been productive of
              excellent results. I take this occasion to render acknowledgements to the gentlemen
              composing my staff for their arduous and disinterested services on that occasion.
              Since the encampment broke up, many new companies have been formed, and a disposition
              to elevate the standard of attainment in all military exercises has been manifest. The
              recommendations contained in the Adjutant General's report are commended to your
              careful consideration. I particularly urge upon you the importance of passing a law,
              in conformity to his recommendation, to provide for copying into record books, to be
              procured for that purpose, the muster-in ar.d muster-out rolls of the Indiana
              soldiers. These contain an account of the service of each soldier. When this record
              shall have been made, a frequent handling of original papers will be unnecessary. and
              the papers will thus be preserved from injury. It will be a reproach to the State if a
              performance of this duty shall be longer neglected. There is a necessity also that you
              shall provide, without delay, a fire-proof vault for the purpose of securing these
              papers against the hazards of fire. Their destruction would do incalculable injustice
              to persons having the strongest Claims to grateful recognition by the State. </p>

            <head rend="center">REVISED STATUTES.</head>
            <p> In conformity to a requirement contained in the act of 1881, concerning the
              publication of the new revised statutes, I appointed the gentlemen composing the Board
              of Revision, Commissioners to prepare these statutes for publication and to
              Superintend the publication thereof. The last delivery of the copies required by law
              to be filed in the Clerks' offices of the several Counties was made in July, 1882. </p>

            <p>The act of 1881 provided that the Commissioners should hold their positions until the
              first day of November of that year, and that the Commissioners and the Governor
              should, on the final adjournment of the General Assembly, advertise for bids for the
              printing and delivery of the statutes. A clause required the Commissioners to annotate
              the contents of the volume, so as to show, by proper reference, the time when all
              statutes in eluded in the volume went into force. </p>

            <p>A literal compliance with the terms of the aet Of 1881, with respect, to the time for
              advertising for bids, was found to be impossible. The work assigned to the
              Commissioners could not, by the utmost labor they could bestow, be completed within
              the time prescribed, and no intelligent bid or bid at all favorable to the State could
              have been expected had bids been solicited when the work was in the incomplete
              condition it was at the time of the adjournment of the Legislature. Besides, the
              volume containing the session arts of 1881 was so large, on account of the bills
              brought before the Legislature by the Board for the revision of laws, that the
              printing could not be completed until a period much later than had been usual in the
              printing of session acts Hence the annotation of the time when the acts passed at the
              session of 1881 took effect could not be made as early as the Legislature had
              contemplated. When the time fixed for the expiration of the offices of the
              Commissioners arrived they, therefore, from public motives and at much personal
              inconvenience, continued in the performance of their labor, without any provision for
              further compensation, until the work contemplated by law had been completed and the
              statutes were ready for delivery. </p>

            <p>The act of 1881 prescribed with particularity what kind of type and in what style the
              Revised Statutes should be printed. The contract was let in conformity to the terms of
              the act. Had the volume, however, been prepared in that manner it would have been most
              inconvenient and unsightly. Fortunately the contractor was willing to print the volume
              in a much better type, and to bind it in a much more attractive style, at the price
              which had been named in the contract and it was accordingly prepared in this manner,
              with the consent of the Commissioners and to the general satisfaction of the legal
              profession. It is a volume which the Commissioners have truly said is "a credit to the
              printers' art." </p>

            <p>The cost of the printing, binding and delivery was $22,233 76, being $2 766.24 less
              than the appropriation for the purpose. </p>

            <p>The Commissioners in their contract took the precaution to provide that, as soon as
              the number of volumes prescribed by law had been printed, the stereotype plates
              employed in printing it, should without additional charge, be turned over to the
              State.</p>

            <p>No provision having been made by law for securing a copyright, the Commissioners took
              out a copyright in their own names, which they promptly assigned to the State. In
              compliance with a request from them, I recommend the passage of an act formally
              accepting the assignment. </p>

            <p>The stereotype plates can occasionally be used to advantage by the State, and could
              also be used by private parties, in printing separately for circulation, particular
              acts contained in the volume. I recommend that provision be made by law, for a
              temporary use of the plates by private parties, for a proper consideration, at the
              discretion of the Board of Public Printing.</p>

            <p>For the laborious work performed by the Commissioners after the end of their term of
              office, I have no doubt it will be the pleasure of the General Assembly to provide a
              proper compensation;, </p>

            <head rend="center">THE NEW STATE HOUSE.</head>
            <p> The progress of the work upon the new State House since the General Assembly last
              met has, on the whole, been satisfactory. While in 1881 the work did not proceed quite
              as actively as had been anticipated, it has during the year just closed been
              prosecuted as diligently as the most sanguine could well have hoped. Under the careful
              and vigilant supervision of the Commissioners, it is believed that it has been
              thoroughly well executed, and will bear the sternest tests. It is a subject of great
              regret that the execution of the remainder of the work is liable to be retarded by a
              dissatisfaction on the part of the contractors, arising from losses said by them to
              have been necessarily incurred while they have been engaged in a diligent and faithful
              performance of their contract. The cost of materials and the prices of labor have
              risen, as they claim, altogether above what they expected, or what might reasonably
              have been expected, when they entered upon their undertaking. If they should decline
              to proceed further under existing circumstances, grave duty will be devolved upon you
              in determining what curse will be the wisest to secure an early and satisfactory
              execution of the unfinished part of the work. </p>

            <p>Provision was made in the contract that changes directed by the Commissioners, with
              the consent of the contractors, during the progress of the work, should not operate to
              discharge the liability of the sureties upon the contractors' band, and in every
              instance where changes have been made they have been made with the consent of the
              contractors, and in conformity to an opinion of the Attorney General that the change
              would not release the sureties.</p>

            <head rend="center">THE KANKAKEE MARSH.</head>
            <p>At the last session of the General Assembly an ; act was passed empowering the
              Governor to appoint a Civil Engineer to make a survey of the wet and swamp lands of
              the Kaukakee region in this State, and to take levels, and make careful estimates,
              with a view of ascertaining the cheap est and most practicable outlets and routes, by
              which to effect successfully a drainage of that vast body of fertile lands. An
              appropriation of $5,000 was made to enable the Engineer to prosecute the work, and the
              Governor was empowered at his discretion, to direct surveys to be made of other wet
              lands for a like purpose. </p>

            <p>The vast region of the Kaukakee is shown to be one of the most fertile regions of the
              State, and, by the excavation of a nearly straight channel to conduct the water of the
              river, a sufficient fall can be obtained to effect a thorough damage. The ease with
              which the channel can be constructed is most gratifying, and the cost of effecting a
              drainage, however considerable it may appear, bears no sort ot proportion to the
              additional value which drainage will impart to the lands. These lands, on account of
              their proximity to Chicago, are covered by a network of leading lines of railroads.
              The estimates of the Engineer, who is of a cautious and <pb n="24"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-023"/> conservative temper may be regarded as being certainly
              above, rather than below, what would be the actual cost of the work required to be
              done. </p>

            <p>It was hoped that the rocky bottom of the bed of the river, which begins in Illinois,
              two miles west of our State line, would not at that point oppose any obstacle to a
              thorough drainage, but the Engineer believes that the water, flowing through its new
              channel, holding particles of earth in suspension, would be likely to deposit a
              sediment at that point and make a bar which might render lands adjacent to the river
              liable to overflow. He thinks that for a distance of half the length of the
              contemplated channel the work of drainage can safely be prosecuted without delay, but
              that the rest of the work should await an acquisition of the right to remove for a
              specified distance the rocky obstruction referred to. A belief has been expressed,
              however, by some hydraulic engineers that until the new channel shall practically
              cease to make the stream muddy any tendency to create a bar at the point mentioned
              might probably be prevented by one of the small vessels needed, at any rate, to be
              maintained in the river for some time after the completion of the work, being fitted
              with simple mechanical appliances, enabling it to stir the sediment and keep it in
              suspension until it can pass off in the current which flows freely over the rocky
              bottom of the river at that point. </p>

            <p>With respect to the manner in which this important understaking shall be prosecuted,
              there will no doubt be found a diversity of opinion. The law of 1869, which intended
              to provide a practical scheme for the the accomplishment of the work, was repealed by
              the General Assembly soon after its enactment. It was found that the effect of the law
              would be to subject to sale for a non-payment of assessments the lands of most of the
              small proprietors. Such proprietors can not pay any considerable assessments until an
              increase of crops, occasioned by the reclamation of their lands, provides them with
              the means of payment. Some method must be devised, if they are to be protected by
              which the work may go on and there may be a reasonable delay in the collection of the
              assessments. With respect to the portion of these lands included n the grant of swamp
              lands made to the State by the United States, the State engaged, when it sold them,
              that the proceeds of the sales should be applied toward draining them. It must be
              confessed that this engagement was imperfectly kept. The more sanguine proprietors
              have hoped that, in consideration of this face, the State would at its own expense
              undertake to drain these lands. It does not, however, seem to me likely that the
              Legislature would be willing to charge the State with the expense of so considerable
              an undertaking. But the fact that the State so imperfectly kept its engagement should
              certainly incline it to a course of liberal legislation. It is believed that it would
              be competent for the State itself to advance money, retaining a lien on the lands for
              a return thereon; but if this should be deemed inexpedient it might empower the
              Counties to be benfited by the drainage to guarantee bonds to be issued in payment for
              the work, retaining a lean on lands benefited in analogy to the provision respecting
              aid to Gravel Road Companies. The subject is one of so great importance that it should
              engage your early and most earnest attention. </p>

            <head rend="center">FEES AND SALARIES.</head>
            <p>For many years complaints have been made in the more populous Counties that the fees
              and salaries of officers were too large for the services perforated, it has also been
              asserted that the means to which there are often strong temptations to resort, for
              obtaining nominations for offices so lucrative, and for securing success at the polls,
              have a corrupting effect upon elections. Before the adoption of the Constitutional
              amendments of 1881, the Legislature was deprived of the power of curing this supposed
              evil. In that year an amendment was passed which has removed the difficulty. This
              amendment was submitted to the electors of the State, and prevailed by a majority of
              more than 90,000 votes. A session of the Legislature has intervened since the
              amendment was adopted, but no act has been passed regulating the compensation of
              officers in the manner contemplated. Every officer should be adequately paid for his
              services, but it is due to the people that no greater sum shall be taken from them,in
              the way of fees and salaries, than is necessary to pay to the officer a fair
              compensation. Officers frequently, however, relinquish regular occupation to obtain
              these places, under an expectation that the rate of fees prevailing when they were
              elected will be substantially maintained. It might be just, therefore, to postpone the
              operation of the regulation act for a reasonable time after its passage. A bill
              property regulating fees and salaries will require much thoughtful consideration, and
              should engage your attention at a very early period of the session. </p>

            <head rend="center">CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.</head>
            <p> The first section of the sixteenth article of the State Constitution is in the
              following language: "Any amendment or amendments to this Constitution may be proposed
              in either branch of the General Assembly; and if the same shall be agreed to by a
              majority of the members elected to each of the two Houses, such proposed amendments
              shall, with the yeas and nays thereon, be entered on their journals and referred to
              the General Assembly to be chosen at the next general election; and if, in the General
              Assembly so next chosen, such proposed amendment or amendment shall be agreed to by a
              majority of all the members elected to each House, then it shall be the duty of the
              General Assembly to submit such amendment or amendments to the electors of the State;
              and if a majority of the said electors shall ratify the same, such amendment or
              amendments shall become a part of this Constitution."</p>

            <p> At the special session of the General Assembly in 1881, several joint resolutions
              were introduced, which were passed by a vote of a majority of the members elected to
              each of the two Houses, proposing certain amendments to the Constitution. The titles
              of the several resolutions, and their numbers, were entered on the journals of the two
              Houses, together with the yeas and nays on the passage. An enrolled copy of each
              resolution containing the amendment set out at full length, was signed by the
              President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, transmitted
              to the Governor, and filed by him, in conformity to law, in the office of the
              Secretary of State. In the canvass for the election of Senators and Representatives to
              the present General Assembly, the point, it is believed, was not raised that proper
              steps had not been taken in the last General Assembly to enable the present one to
              consider the amendments. Since the election, however, the point has been raised
              through the public press that the proposed amendments are not in a condition to be
              considered by the present General Assembly, because it is said they were not entered
              at length in the journals of the two Houses of the last General Assembly. Neither of
              the points raised has been settled in this State by any judicial decision. An
              executive construction was given, however, to one of them in a message of Governor
              Baker, in the case of what is known as the Wabash and Erie Canal amendment. That
              amendment was not entered at length upon the journal of either of the two Houses. The
              resolution by which the amendment was proposed was referred to in the journal of each
              House by its title merely, and the enrolled copy thereof was signed by the presiding
              officer of each House, and was duly filed in the office of the Secretary of State.
              Governor <pb n="25" xml:id="VAA8558-21-024"/> Baker maintained that this was a
              sufficient compliance with the terms of the Constitution. </p>

            <p>The Constitution requires, in case of bills, that upon the passage thereof the vote
              shall be taken by yeas and nays and entered upon the journals of the two Houses. In a
              case where the point was urged that an act was not in force because no entry of the
              yeas and nays on its passage appeared in the journals, the Supreme Court held that the
              signatures of the presiding officers were conclusive evidence of its passage. </p>

            <p>The Constitution is silent respecting the manner in which a proposed amendment shall
              be referred from the first to the second General Assembly. The main object, no doubt,
              is to get it before the Second Assembly. If the genuine resolution passed comes before
              the Second Assembly, and is acted upon, the object of a reference would seem to have
              been attained, and the purpose of the framers of that instrument to have been carried
              out. There was, I believe, no formal reference of the amendments adopted in 1881 by
              the First to the Second General Assembly. </p>

            <p>In the canvass last autumn it is said that some of the Senators and Representatives
              who were chosen at the November election publicly pledged themselves that, if they
              were chosen, they would vote at the present session to submit the amendments to the el
              rotors at a special election. Without saying anything respecting the merits of the
              several amendments, I can frankly express a belief that pledges upon which electors
              were induced to vote for gentlemen holding seats in either of the two Houses of the
              Assembly, will not be disregarded except for overwhelming reasons. </p>

              the Indiana Senate be adopted as the rules for the present session of the Senate,
              except that the words "President of the," in line 2 of rule 8 be stricken out; and

              be admitted under color of amendment.'" He said-I move the amendment on the ground
              that rule 28 is practically a nugatory rule as it now stands. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN: It seems to me it is not necessary to adopt this amendment. I am quite
              willing to agree with the Senator over the way [Mr. Foulke] to strike out this rule

              everywhere, and I don't think it ought to be adopted.</p>

            <p> The amendment [Mr. Foulke's} was rejected.</p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR appointed Messrs. Brown and Foulke such Committee on the part
              of the Senate. </p>

            <p> Mr. WHITE offered a resolution for the printing of 250 copies of tue Governor's

            <p>Mr. BUNDY moved to amend by increasing the number to 1,000.</p>

              Senate.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to. </p>

            <p> The Senate then resumed the consideration of the resolution pending at the
              adjournment last night, the question being on Mr. Brown's motion to reconsider the
              vote adopting Mr. White's resolution directing the State Librarian to furnish
              stationery for the use of the Senate.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY declared the State Librarian to be the person authorized by law to furnish
              stationery for the use of the General Assembly, and read Section 5,628 and other
              sections of the statutes of 1881, contending that the Bureau of Printing was required
              to attend to the printing, binding, etc. It has been the custom for the State
              Librarian to furnish the stationery for the General Assembly-last session on a
              resolution offered by the Senator from Allen [Mr. Bell]. The law and the precedent are
              both in favor of this resolution, and it ought to pass. He opposed the motion to
              reconsider. </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL said it did not make a snap's difference with him who furnished the
              stationery, but the State has an outstanding contract made by Republican State
              officers, in which is included all sorts of paper, as well as engrossing paper such as
              is used here, inks, mucilage, etc., etc. This contract was awarded to the lowest
              bidder, and no doubt is at a price lower than the small quantity desired by the Senate
              can be now purchased. No person should be authorized to go outside and purchase for us
              in the face of this contract made with sworn officers of the State. The resolution
              should be framed so as to come under this contract in the proper and regular way. </p>

            <p>The motion to reconsider was agreed by-yeas 25; nays 20. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to amend the resolution by striking out and inserting new matter
              requiring persons acting for the Senate to make requisitions on the Public Bureau of
              Printing, and all others will be unauthorized. He said he had not lost all confidence
              in some of the acts of the Republican party, and when it was in its full bloom and
              grandeur the popular representative branch of the Republican party adopted this very
              resolution. He proposed to accept this wise act sanctified by the act of the
              Republican party.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY moved, ineffectually-yeas, 20; nays 26-to lay this substitute on the
              table.</p>

            <p>The substitute was agreed to and the resolution as amended, being read, was adopted
              without division.</p>

            <p>And then the Senate adjourned till Monday at 10 o'clock a. m.</p>

              Constitutional rule requiring a bill to be read by sections on three several days be
              dispensed with, so the bill may be read the second time by title, considered as

              nature, and there Is an emergency for the immediate passage of the bill, which he
              explained. He moved for a dispensation of the Constitutional restriction, that the
              bill may be pressed to the final reading BOW. The motion was agreed to-yeas, 42; nays,

            <p>Mr. BUNDY hoped this resolution would be adopted. If there is one subject more than
              another in which the people of this State are interested, it is the fee and salary
              question. County officers are getting rich in one term by reason of their charging
              constructive fees. Nothing can be done intelligently to remedy this evil till a
              Committee has heard evidence. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD saw necessity for information, but it will be time enough to grant this
              power when they ask for it. </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE could see but one purpose in opposing a motion of this kind. No one can
              tell without experience what these officers can perform their services for. Whether or
              not there is cause for complaint, the people demand that something shall be done with
              the fee and salary bill. Unless it is desired to suppress all action on this subject,
              he hoped the resolution would pass. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES opposed the resolution, because of the construction put upon it that it
              would be a call for County officers to come up here. He saw no necessity for the
              resolution at this stage. stage. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to refer the resolution to the <orgName>Committee on Fees and
                Salaries</orgName>. </p>

            <p>The motion was rejected by yeas, 23; nays, 24. </p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL desired to see the resolution passed. He believed some offices supposed
              to be very rumenerative were not, while others not supposed to be lucrative were
              indeed so. There is a great difference. He was sorry to notice a somewhat partisan
              division in this matter. </p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN was surprised at the introduction of this resolution by the author. For
              100 days the present law was before the Senate, and it was passed by a Republican body
              and signed by Republican officers. He was willing to try the present law two years
              longer. </p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS deprecated making this a party measure, but regarded the resolution" as
              unnecessary. He thought an equitable adjustment can be made by calculating upon a
              basis of population. He hoped this Legislature will adopt an equitable fee and salary
              bill. He also opposed the resolution because it proposes to give into the hands of
              this Committee power unlimited.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD made an ineffectual motion-yeas, 11; nays, 35-to lay the resolution on
              the table.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL now hoped to see the resolution passed. He believed in getting competent men
              and paying fair price for services. He hoped the unlimited power conferred by the
              resolution will not be abused With a little discretion not much mileage will have to
              be paid to County officers [Laugnter.]</p>

            <p>Mr. WHITE hoped the resolution will pass. </p>

            <p>Mr WILLARD hoped the resolution will not pass, because it gives the Committee
              unlimited power to summons any person from any point of the State to whom mileage and
              per diem will have to be paid. It may be productive of great expense, which the
              Committee has not asked for. After consultation if the Committee ask for this power it
              might then be granted. </p>

            <p>Mr. ADKISON asked who was responsible for the political aspect in which this
              resolution was receiver. One County in his District is largely Democratic, the other
              is Republican, and there is no objection there to a project of this kind. There is a
              necessity for it. We do not want the kind of evidence that will come up here for the
              purpose of influencing legislation. He favored the resolution. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN also favored the resolution. </p>

            <p>Mr McCULLOUGH understood the feeling to be universally in favor of a law under which
              there can be no constructive fees. There are too many County officers about the
              Legislature when the question of fees and salaries is considered. As a rule the more
              that is heard about fees and salaries from County officers, the less is known about
              that subject. Men interested directly in the deliberations of this body will color
              their statements. The resolution would probably be too expensive at this time; and it
              will bring here a class of men that will not enlighten the legislators on that subject
              Some members on this Committee have had experience, and if the Committee shall ask for
              further power in the premises he would be willing to giant it. </p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY regarded the resolution as a proper one-the Committee will not send for
              persons and papers unnecessarily. All are satisfied there should be action by this
              Legislature on this question. We want an investigation, and evidence on the subject
              brought before the Senate. This is not apolitical question. The present incumbents of
              County offices are not The only men in the State who can give desirable information
              concerning fees and salaries. He deprecated the laws now on the statute books that
              almost drive litigants out of the Court. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to refer the resolution to the <orgName>Committee on Fees and
                Salaries</orgName>, with instructions to report whether there is a necessity for the
              passage of this resolution, pending which-</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. BUNDY it was referred to the <orgName>Committee on

            <p> Mr. SAYRE offered a resolution authorizing the Chairmen of Committees and the
              Secretary of the Senate to draw on the State Librarian for stationery for the use of
              Standing Committees, said requisitions to be indorsed by the Assistant Secretary and
              entered on the journal of the Senate on the day issued. </p>

            <p>Mr. SAYRE moved to refer it to the <orgName>Committee on Printing</orgName>.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY and Mr. GRAHAM insisted the law made it the duty of the State Librarian to
              furnish stationery for the use of the General Assembly.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN insisted that the law referred to was by implication repealed, and the
              Senate has already acted upon this subject definitely. He made the point of order that
              the resolution is out of order.</p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the point well taken. If the law is as stated by the
              Senators from Henry and Hamilton then there ia no need of action by this body; if not,
              as stated by the Senator from Jackson, the Senate has already acted on this
              subject.</p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM saw a tendency in this matter to override the law, which may go so far as
              to try and take away the power vested in the Executive of the State and place it in
              other hands. </p>

            <pb n="38" xml:id="VAA8558-21-037"/>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES did not consider that the section referred to authorizes the Librarian to
              purchase supplies, but only sets out the manner of paying therefor. The senate may
              direct any one to purchase supplies elsewhere, without conflict with the Section 5,698
              of the Revised Statutes of 1881. Mr. FOULKE knew of no repeal of the Section 5,698 and
              believed it proper for the Senate to direct how much stationery is needed, etc. </p>

              River region, authorizing the printing of 500 copies of the report of Engineer
              Campbell, under whom the survey was made. He stated that the number printed had been

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS believed the Survey Commission has authority to expend moneys from that

              shows that this stationery and other articles necessary for the transaction of the
              business of the Senate at 10 per cent. cheaper if the minority report is adopted than
              otherwise, and for the purpose of economizing to that extent and saving that amount of

            <p> Mr. HENRY favored the adoption of the resolution as offered, which calls for the

              extremely political, and therefore decline to vote on this roll call, because I am

            <head rend="center">FITZ JOHN PORTER.</head>

            <p>Mr. SPANN offered a preamble and resolution as follows: </p>

            <floatingText>
              <body>
                <div type="resolution">
                  <p>Whereas, There is now pending in the Senate of the United States a bill known
                    as the bill for the relief of General Fitz John Porter from the finding of a
                    Court Martial properly organized, which found him guilty of disobedience of
                    orders to his superior officers, thereby brining great disaster to the cause of
                    the Union Army and causing a great loss of life, and brining shame and disgrace
                    to the brave and loyal men who were standing in defense of the Union;</p>

                  <p> Resolved, That our Senators and Representatives in both Houses of Congress are
                    hereby asked and urged to use their influence of voice and vote to defeat said
                    measure, and the Secretary of the Senate is directed to transmit a copy of this
                    resolution to each Congressman and Senator from Indiana.</p>
                </div>
              </body>
            </floatingText>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES moved to lay it on the table.</p>

            <p> This motion was agreed to by yeas, 23; nays, 17.</p>

            <p> Pending the roll call-</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN, in explanation of his vote, said he thought our Senators and
              Representatives in Congress are quite as competent to discharge their duties with
              instructions from this Senate as they would be with them. In the next place, General
              Grant, who is the King of all the Kings in the Republican party, has declared his
              belief in the complete innocence of General Porter, and denounced the conviction as
              wrong, and many other members of the Republican party equally as able as the Senator
              from Rush [Mr. Spann] have likewise spoken in Porter's behalf. For that reason he
              should vote to lay the motion on the table.</p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, when his name was called, was understood to say he had not examined
              into the Fitz John Porter case, but believed there are two sides to the question as to
              reinstatement. He had confidence in those who have the decision of that question and
              was willing to allow them to act without direction from this body, and had no desire
              to give instructions to them on that question. He voted "aye."</p>

            <p> Mr. GRAHAM, when his named was called, said for years this question had been
              reposing and the country has been satisfied. Though the question has been brought
              forward from the time General Porter has never been restored. General Logan, who has
              knowledge of the merits of the case, still adheres to the wisdom of the verdict of the
              Court Martial. He was satisfied that officer's failure to do his duty caused thousands
              of soldiers to sleep the long sleep of death, and now he can afford to sleep in
              abeyance. He voted "no."</p>

            <p> Mr. HOWARD, understanding this to be a political question being paired declined to
              vote.</p>

            <p> Mr. McINTOSH, when his name was called, said he could not regard this as a political
              question, and as he was perfectly willing to vote upon the merits of the question he
              voted "no."</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN, when his name was called, said he was sorry, exceedingly sorry, that some
              Senators on the other side of the Chamber shield themselves from voting on this
              resolution behind what is commonly known as a pair. He did not regard this as a
              political question in any sense, however, as some think so, and, intending to observe
              his pair with a fellow Senator [Mr. Bell], he should not vote. </p>
            <pb n="44" xml:id="VAA8558-21-043"/>

            <p> Mr. WILLARD, when his name was called, said he did not regard this as a political
              question, nor did he desire this vote to reveal a partisan vote. For that reason and
              being willing to vote upon the question directly, he would not vote with a majority of
              his own party, but voted "no."</p>

            <p> Mr. YANCEY considered this a strictly political question. He believed that if
              justice had been dealt out to Fitz John Porter fifteen years ago he would not be now
              knocking at the door for back pay and reinstatement. He thought it outrageous that any
              man who had pursued such a traitorous course should seek to be restored to an equal
              footing with honest men. He voted "no."</p>

            <p> Mr. BENZ desired his name to be called again, and said he did not consider this a
              political question and voted "no," but he would change his vote now and vote "aye."
              [Laughter].</p>

            <p> Mr. KEISER desired his name to be called again, saying, without regarding this as a
              political question at all, and as one who served with his fellow-members on this floor
              now opposed to him in politics, he voted "no."</p>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGASS had not regarded this as a political question, but as it is put in
              that light he desired to have his named called again so as to change his vote. He was
              following one of the grandest and noblest leaders of the Union Army when standing
              before this body he said a great injustice has been done General Fitz John Porter.
              Being a soldier in the Army, with General Grant as a leader-after elevated to the
              Chief Magistracy of the United States by the soldiers of this country, who very
              recently said he was satisfied, upon an investigation of the testimony and evidence in
              the case, that a great injustice had been done a worthy comrade-in-arms-he though he
              could afford as a soldier in the Union Army to vote "aye."</p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH, of Jay demanding that his name be called again, also changed his vote
              from "no" to "aye.".</p>

            <p> The vote was then announced as above.</p>

            <p> So the resolution lies on the table.</p>

            <p> On motion the Senate took a recess till 3 o'clock. </p>



            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">IN MEMORY OF EX-SENATOR CHAPMAN.</head>

              <p>At the hour of 3 the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR resumed the Chair, and announced the order
                to be memorial service in honor of General George Chapman, late a member of this
                body.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN moved that the courtesies of the floor be extended to Mayor Grubbs, who
                was a fellow Senator with General Chapman, and that he be allowed to make such
                remarks as he may see fit.</p>

              <p> The motion was agreed to.</p>

              <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS offered the following:</p>

              <floatingText>
                <body>
                  <div type="resolution">
                    <p> Resolved, That in the death of Senator George H. Chapman, this Senate has
                      lost an able officer and valuable member, the people of the State a
                      conscientious Representative, the State a most useful citizen, and the Nation
                      a patriot and one of its bravest defenders.</p>
                  </div>
                </body>
              </floatingText>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS read a sketch of the life of his late colleague [General George H.
                Chapman] and though not feeling qualified to be his eulogist-not being intimately
                acquainted previous to the election of 1880-his paper was more largely a memorial
                tribute than biographical.</p>

              <p> Messrs. Willard, Spann, Fletcher, [General Chapman's successor] ex-Senator Grubbs,
                [by courtesy of the Senate], Henry, Ristine, Bundy, Graham, [who sat at the same
                desk with General Chapman last session] and Brown, following in remarks suited to
                the occasion.</p>

              <p> In support of this resolution, Mr. Van Vorhis said:</p>

              <p> Mr. President-Senator George H. Chapman was born in Holland, Mass., November 1832.
                His father was Jacob P. Chapman, who was for several years prominently identified
                with the press of Indiana. </p>

              <p> The late Senator received most of his early education in Indianapolis, in the
                Marion County Seminary. At the age of fifteen he entered the United States Navy as a
                midshipman, where he remained three years. In 1853, he was connected with his father
                in the publication of a paper known as "The Chanticleer." afterward as the Indiana
                Republican. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1857. In the same year he
                was Assistant Clerk of the House of Representatives. In 1859 and 1860 he was
                Assistant Clerk of the Lower House of the Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh
                Congresses. On October 21, 1861, after the beginning of the War of Rebellion, he was
                appointed Major of the Third Indiana Cavalry. One year after he was commissioned
                Lieutenant Colonel, and in less than five months more Colonel. On July 21, 1864, he
                was promoted to be Brigadier General of volunteers. On Mary 13, 1865, for
                meritorious conduct at the battle of Winchester, he was breveted Major General of
                volunteers. After the close of the War he was first appointed and afterward elected
                Judge of the Marion Criminal Court. After the close of his term of office as Judge
                he engaged in the practice of his profession in this city. In the fall of 1880 he
                was elected as a member of the State Senate for the term ending in 1884.</p>

              <p> He died at his residence in this city on the evening of the 16th day of June,
                1882. Such, in brief, is the history of the public life of a man of whom it may be
                truthfully said he won every distinction almost alone. He was without influence,
                except what he gathered about him by a recognition of merits, and this recognition
                his own conduct compelled. I do not feel that I am in any sense qualified to be his
                eulogist. Though representing the same County in the last Senate, I had from the
                election in 1880 not a very intimate personal acquaintance with General Chapman. I
                knew him as you and many others knew him, by the reputation that he had made for
                himself. I knew him by the way in which he impressed himself upon those who were
                more intimately acquainted with him than I. General Chapman can not be said to have
                been prepossessing in appearance. Socially, he was retiring in manner. To a stranger
                he did not always represent himself well. But the warmth and strength of the
                friendship entertained for him by those who were his most intimate acquaintances and
                had opportunity to know him best, was an index to the intensity of his intellect and
                the force of his character. He not only compelled recognition, but he attaached to
                him with warmth that was unusual even hearts as well as intellects. It is only by
                the words of such to whom in social life he had more fully revealed himself that I
                was able to judge with any degree of fullness of those traits of character so
                admirable in a friend. Never in his sociely much until the meeting of the last
                Senate. I was just beginning, through the associations there begun, to feel and
                appreciate his generous and kindly nature when he died.</p>

              <p> General Chapman was so constituted that it was impossible to know him quickly.
                Association with him, however, never caused any man to esteem him less; acquaintance
                with him always increased respect for him. </p>

              <p> His public life gave evidence of his superior ability. His knowledge of questions
                of public interest was comprehensive and thorough. Wherever he served he served
                well, and whether as a citizen, a soldier, a lawyer, a Judge, or a Senator on this
                floor, his right to a place in the front rank was recognized. He was dignified, but
                was without ostentation. In his opinions he was independent, but was never
                intolerant of the opinions of others. Distinguished for his bravery in military
                life, he was no less distinguished for his moral courage in civil life. That which
                he believed to be right he advocated with the full strength of his clear intellect,
                never <pb n="45" xml:id="VAA8558-21-044"/> hesitating for one moment to number his
                supports or to estimate the number or weight of his opponents. He was a man of
                convictions, and his convictions were formed by careful investigations. and were the
                dictates of an enlightened judgment. No man in his delibrations appeared to be less
                influenced by personal considerations than he, and the course dictated by his
                judgment and conscience he followed with religious fidelity and with singular
                unselfishness. He was firm and steadfast in his opinions and convictions, and
                persistent in his advocacy of them. but be was not narrow; he kept his mind open to
                receiver the full force ot any argument against them, and no man yielded a position
                more willingly or quickly than he when convinced of error. </p>

              <p>He never prevaricated with his own under standing. He was frank, and at times
                outspoken almost to offensiveness, but it was in the spirit of candor, and without a
                touch of malice. He was just in bis judgments, and was not much influenced by
                prejudices, and his estimates of others were colored by a spirit of true charity,
                but insincerity he could not and would not overlook, He was especially severe in his
                condemnation of anyone who occupied a position of insincerity before the public. His
                attitude was never uncertain, and his position on any question never remained long
                in doubt. He was true to his own highest conceptions of right in all his public
                life. With him policy was but another I name for the right, and expediency but
                another name for duty The slightest sacrifice of principle was a price he never paid
                for preferment. </p>

              <p>If he had follies-and who in all the earth has not-the remembrance of them is made
                bright by the memory of his victory over them. If he had faults they were never
                wilful, and his splendid virtues cover them as with a mantle. He has left us the
                legacy of a true life, and has gone on before us; passed out of sight beyond the
                vail that marks the limit of human knowledge, into the illimitable future. And the
                portals through which he disappeared are radiant with the hope of the Father's
                house, of the resplendent glories of which it has not "entered into the heart of man
                to conceive." </p>

              <head rend="center">SENATOR FLETCHER'S TRIBUTE.</head>

              <p>Senator Fletcher spoke as follows :</p>

              <p>Sitting at this desk, decorated with these emblems of sorrow occupying this chair,
                made vacant by the hand of death, and representing the same constituency, it seems
                fitting that the first time I address this Senate it should be in acknowledging the
                worth and honoring the memory of Senator Chapman. </p>

              <p>Upon the sudden death of a friend, the first outburst of grief is like molten
                iron-it burns, seethes and hisses in our hearts; but when the mass is cooled by
                time. we may inspect it, or shape it at our pleasure and test its true value as a
                metal. A summer's gun has warmed his grave: a winter's snow now covers it; the first
                hot grief xs cooled, and this memory of his clear, bright character remains with us,
                an imperishable monument. In touching upon his character I would adopt the plan of
                plain perspiecuity of truth.</p>

              <p>Senator Chapman was a type of highly nervous organization; his mental seemed to.
                feed inordinately upon his physical. His mind was in- tensity itself. and subjects
                examined by him had to yield up their facts. </p>

              <p>I had known Senator Chapman nearly thirty years-as a youthful journalist, as a
                citizen, a soldier, a jurist and legislator. I met him frequently, not as an
                intimate friend, but neighborly acquaintance. He was a man who would attract
                attention by his quiet demeanor, unless he was aroused to action by a just cause;
                then he would equally attract by his persistent, terse, sharp, incisive method of
                dealing with and pursuing his subject. He took life seriously, and circumstances
                with the last two years had laid upon him a twofold burden of sorrow in the : death
                of two bright boys. About a year ago, just as twilight was fading into darkness, I
                met him in a remote part of the city alone. He did not recognize, me, but passed
                with measured tread-eyes peering into the gloaming, as vainly looking for a lost
                hope. As he disappeared into the darkness he reminded me of a walking monument of
                grief.</p>

              <p>I saw him no more until we met, one beautiful afternoon in March last, in the
                delightful Park of San Pedro Springs, at San Antonia, Texas. His changed look then
                betokened that his life's sun was going down. He talked, however, more freely than
                usual, and more kindly of the world than I had ever known. Particularly did he dwell
                upon his work in this body, which he regarded as a laborious and thankless task,
                wherein he used his best abilities and diligence to act wisely upon all
                questions-freeing them from partisan qualities. But his humble efforts, he thought,
                had frequently been misconstrued by many whom he regarded as friends. I saw him but
                once after his return home; then came the startling news that be was dead.</p>

                conclude that he was a good citizen, a brave and skillful soldier, a wise jurist, an
                able statesman and an honest man. Than this no higher eulogy can be spoken. </p>

                  <p> Whereas, The Constitution provides that any amendments may be proposed in

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS read from manuscript a care fully prepared argument in support of his
              resolution, citing various authorities and decisions tending to prove that the absence
              of the proposed Constitutional amendments from the pages of the Clerk' journal of the
              last General Assembly prevents action on those amendments by this General Assembly
              except as a new proposition.</p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN, not desiring to enter upon this discussion from a legal standpoint at this
              time, indicated his opposition to the resolution, especially the latter part.
              Instructing the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> to examine the journals of the
              twc Houses,. because that is not right, or fair or just to the people of the State. It
              is not right or fair because a majority of that Committee is made up from, the
              Democratic party, and an opinion from that, Committee might influence some members on
              this floor. He said; I am sorry to part company with my friend from Marion County (Mr.
              Van Vorhis). I admire the courage he has displayed on this question, but I desire to
              say to him that as between him and the Republican party the roads, fork on this
              question, and I believe the Republican party will stand square upon this question as
              honest men standing upon a platform that shall give to evey man the right to
              investigate for him self.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN hoped the Senate would adopt the resolution. He did not understand that a
              report from a Committee would bind the conscience cut any Senator. No one is expected
              to answer the able and conclusive argument of the Senator from Marion [Mr. Van
              Vorhis], if indeed it can be answered at all, without a faithful and careful
              investigation ot the question. The Senator from Rush [Mr. Spann] may make the roads
              fork if he chooses between the entire Republican party and the Senator from Marion
              [Mr. Van Vorhis] if he chooses, but it will take a much more able man than the Senator
              from Rush or any member of his party to overturn the sound reasons the Senator from
              Marion has given. This is not a question that dips its wing into the dirty pool of
              politics, but it is a question that appeals to the judgment and conscience of every
              individual Senator. No party this side of hell and the grave, or hell itself, could
              bind him to vote according to the dictates of its caucus upon a question of such high
              importance aa this. The Wabash and Erie Canal resolution is a pre<pb n="50"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-049"/>cedent, and that was not entered upon the journals of the
              two Houses as the Constitution requires; but that question was not raised then-it was
              not discussed at all. No person thought anything about it. But the Wabash and Erie
              'Canal simply asserted the State's continuation of the contract between the holders of
              the stock and the State herself. And it can not be regarded as a precedent of the high
              authority that it would be, had the question been discussed and attention called to it
              as attention has been called to this. But whether the Wabash and Erie Canal amendment
              is a part of the Constitution or not, depends entirely whether it asserts the right or
              wrong construction of the contract. A clause in the Constitution that would strike
              down the rights in a contract between the State's creditors and herself, would be void
              anyway.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL did not propose at this litre to enter into a discussion of the question
              involved. It is one of the highest intent si to ail. Neither did he regard it as a
              political question. When he learns where the right and truth lie, it is beyond the
              power of any body of men belonging to any party to control or direct his actions. This
              is a question of jurisdiction. We have no jurisdiction in any amendment not properly
              passed a preceding General Assembly in accordance with the Constitution. Our action
              and our judgment is final and no Court in the land can review or go behind it. Every
              member is called upon to exercise his highest skill in the determination of this
              question. The principal point about it he was not well satisfied is what is meant by
              the words in the Constitution, "to be entered on the journals,". If the Constitution
              had said "to be spread at length upon the journals of the House." then there would be
              no doubt about the meaning whatever. Do those words in the Constitution mean that a
              minute shall be entered, or do they mean the resolution itself shall be entered? Do
              they mean it shall be spread hic verba, to use the language of the law? There are
              peculiar reasons why that should be so. The strong reason is there seems to be no
              other method of authentication provided. It need not be by joint resolution that
              amendments may be proposed. They may originate in either House and agreed to by
              members of both Houses. Another reason in support of this view is that the framers of
              the Constitution were contemplating a safe preservation of the exact language of the
              proposed amendment, so that it might be out of the power of anybody to change it. A
              paper to be found only among the mass of matter in the Secretary of State's Office
              containing so importatn a matter as an amendment to the Constitution-the attempt to
              preserve such a paper in that manner would be unwise, and that may have been the view
              the framers of the Constitution took of it. It is altogether probably the framers of
              the Constitution meant to provide a method of preservation beyond the possibility of
              mistake, and to put it beyond the power of change or loss. He hoped the resolution
              would be passed; hoped the Committee would investigate and report all the light that
              can be had on the subject, and then hoped to hear not only from those who agreed with
              him, but just as freely from those who disagreed.</p>

            <p>Mr. BISCHOWSKY, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said as the
              resolution of the Senator from Marion only peeks to have the facts reported by the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> concerning the Constitutional amendments, and
              not the opinion of that Committee, he should vote "aye." </p>

            <p>Mr. HOWARD, when his name was called stated his pair with the Senator from Noble [Mr.
              Hostetter], and as this has the aspect of a political question, preferred not to
              vote.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD, in explanation of his vote, said as he understood it this resolution
              merely calla upon the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> to furnish any
              information it may be able to obtain in regard to the condition of the journals, and
              as he could not understand it as requiring an expression of opinion either one way or
              another upon the question as to whether these amendments have been property entered
              upon the journals, but merely for the purpose of securing this information under the
              authentication of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, should vote "aye." </p>

            <p> Mr. YANCEY, when his name was called, said as he believed these amendments pending
              and these sort of measures simply a hood-winking, a quibble, and a legerdamain
              practice to fool the people of the State, he should vote "no." </p>

            <p> The vote was then announced as above recorded, and so the resolution was adopted.

                  <div type="resolution">

                    <p>Whereas, John H. Winterbotham, late defeated candidate for Congress in the
                      Thirteenth District of this State, has memorialized this Senate, making
                      certain suggestions in regard to legislation and asking for consideration

                    <p> Whereas, Upon dates concurrent or nearly so with the transmission of said
                      memorial, the said Winterbotham sent in writing to a majority of the members
                      of this Senate language highly insulting to one of its esteemed members, the
                      Senator from Laporte, and not stopping at that, sent to the member himself a
                      copy of the said scandalous letter which he had sent to a majority of the
                      members of this Senate, and together with such letter, sent one to the Senator
                      himself couched in the most ungentlemanly and insult<pb n="51"

                      were to brand the Senator from Laporte as a treacherous scoundrel, and that
                      the Senate, by its majority, should watch with constant distrust his action as
                      a Senator; and, </p>

                    <p>Whereas, We desire to express confidence in our brother Senator from Laporte,
                      and to have it known that this body construes this insult to one of its
                      members in his official capacity as an insult to the Senate itself; therefore </p>

                    <p>Resolved, That the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName>. to whom was
                      referred the memorial, be and are hereby instructed to return the said
                      memorial to the said Winterbotham without consideration. </p>

              </floatingText>

              <p> Mr. CAMPBELL read several pages of manuscript, in which he held that as ex-Senator
                Winterbotham shown disrespect to one Senator he had shown it to the entire Senate,
                and was therefore not entitled to any consideration by the Senate.</p>

              <p>Several Senators, soon after he commenced, insisted that, the resolution was out of
                order.</p>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: He disliked to decide the point of order, and would let
                the discussion go on. The majority can control the matter in some other way than to
                require the Chair to cut off discussion. </p>

              <p>Mr BROWN said he bad the honor and the pleasure to present the memorial referred
                to, and in it there is not a word of reproach for any person in the Senate, or for
                any Senator. He spoke sarcastically for some time, and in conclusion moved to lay
                the resolution on the table. </p>

              <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas, 24; nays, 20.</p>

              <p> Mr. Brown moved to reconsider this vote by which his motion was agreed to and to
                lay that motion on the table.</p>

              <p> The latter motion was agreed to by yeas, 24; nays, 20. </p>

              General Assembly concerning the proposed amendments to the Constitution.</p>

              all papers and acts concerning either House of the General Assembly.</p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT opposed the resolution and said: "This resolution ought not to prevail, it
              seeing to me. This resolution requires the Secretary of State to transmit certified
              copies of the acts of the last General Assembly to this House. This is already done in
              the statute books that are on the desks of every member. This statute provides that
              the acts of our General Assembly shall b entered upon the journal and submitted to the

              <head rend="center">A BANKRUPT LAW.</head>

              <p>The joint resolution [S. 4] instructing our Senator and requesting our
                Representative to oppose the general bankrupt law now pending in Congress was taken
                from the speaker's table and read, whereupon Mr. HEFFREN moved an amendment which
                was adopted, to strike out the word "prove" and insert the word "oppose."</p>

              <p> Mr. JEWETT said: As a member of this House I think that resolution ought not to be
                adopted. I am certain that the commercial interest of this country has increased of
                late under a thorough bankrupt law, and such a law tends as much as anything else in
                my judgment, to bring about great commercial prosperity. Now, I will say to the
                gentlemen of this House who are not engaged in the practice of law that I have paid
                some little attention tot he law, and I find that the law now before Congress
                radically differs from the cumbrous laws formerly in force.</p>

              <p> Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, said we have thirteen Representatives and two Senators
                in Congress from this State. I think it is not wise in us to attempt to instruct our
                Representatives. I think we ought to waive this matter for the present and let this
                resolution go to the table.</p>

              <p> Mr. FRAZIER: I can not add anything to what has been already said by the gentlemen
                from Washington [Mr. Heffren] and from Tippecanoe [Mr. Smith], but I give my hearty
                concurrence to what they have said on this subject. </p>

              <p> Mr. ADAMS: I think that the commercial interests of our country demand, and always
                have demanded, some kind of bankrupt law, and I am opposed to the resolution.
                Because we have had some bankrupt laws that were ineffectual is no reason why we
                should not have a good bankrupt law.</p>

              <p> Mr. PATTEN: I think a general bankrupt law will be proper and right. It protects
                the debtor class. I think we ought to have a bankrupt law that will protect the
                general interest of the country.</p>

              <p> Mr. MONTGOMERY: My constituency are in favor of a bankrupt law, and I do hope this
                resolution will not be adopted.</p>

              <p> Mr. MOCK: I am opposed to a bankrupt law and in favor of the resolution.</p>

              <p> Mr. GORDON: In the history of the country we have had three bankrupt laws, and
                they have all been repealed because they have proved unprofitable experiments. The
                gentlemen on the other side of this question are not able to tell us that the law
                now before Congress is anything but an experiment. The sentiments of the people of
                the State of Indiana are overwhelmingly in favor of no bankrupt law, and I believe
                that the resolution ought to prevail.</p>

              <p> Mr. WILSON, of Marion: I do not know of any law to-day under which an unfortunate
                debtor can be relieved from his embarrassments so as to start again in life. I am
                backed up by the best lawyers when I say that the bankrupt law is a humane law. It
                gives a man an opportunity to start anew. We know that the bills pending in Congress
                have been submitted to the best legal talent in the East and West, and if there is
                any thing in experience this bill ought to pass. I believe that the business men of
                New York and Boston and other Eastern cities have petitioned Congress for the
                passage of this law. </p>

              <p> Mr. SHOCKNEY-I think the State of Indiana is as ably represented in Congress as
                any State in the Union, and I am in favor of letting our Representatives exercise
                their judgment in this matter.</p>

              <p> Mr. DEEM said, I shall record my vote in favor of this resolution.</p>

              <p>Pending the discussion on the resolution the House adjourned until 10 a.m.
                to-morrow. </p>

            <p>The SPEAKER announced the order of business to be the consideration of the joint
              resolution [S. 4] pending at the adjournment yesterday afternoon, for instruction to
              Indiana Senators and a request of Representatives in Congress from Indiana, to oppose
              the passage of a bankrupt law.</p>

            <p> Mr. ROBINSON said: I am in favor of a well adjusted bankrupt law. It has been
              conceded by members opposed to this resolution that a good bankrupt law would be
              beneficial. I am therefore in favor of the law now pending before Congress. </p>

            <p> Mr. BEST: I shall vote against this resolution, not because I am in favor of this
              law or against it, but because the people of Steuben County have as much confidence in
              our Representatives in Congress as they have in this body, and are willing to trust
              them to act without instructions. </p>

            <p> Mr. ANTRIM said: I think it is our duty to express our views on this matter. I am
              decidedly opposed to a bankrupt law and shall favor the resolution.</p>

            <p> Mr. CABBAGE was satisfied that the bankrupt system had been a failure, and for that
              reason was in favor of the resolution.</p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN demanded the previous question but the House refused to second the
              demand.</p>

            <p>Mr COPELAND: I am opposed to this resolution for various reasons. I do not believe
              this House was sent here to instruct our Congressmen, and do not believe we ought to
              Instruct our Representatives in Congress to vote on the pending question-I for one am
              not in favor of sending Representatives to Congress who have not back bone enough to
              vote for what they think to be for the best interests of the country.</p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, in opposing the resolution/said the greatest commercial nation in the
              world has a bankrupt law. I hardly think that any class of men are competent to give
              instructions on this matter who have not given the question careful attention,
              therefore I shall vote "no" on the reso-</p>

            <p> Mr. SHIVELY: I shall vote "no," believing that our Senators and Representatives from
              this State, who are on the ground and examining this law, can vote more wisely on this
              question than we can.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILEY said: I am opposed to this resolution. I am in favor of a wise and just
              bankrupt law. I have examined into the merits of the law before Congress at the
              present day. I feel satisfied that if the members of this House would examine it for
              themselves the bankrupt law now before Congress, it would materially chang the sense
              of this House concerning this law. I am in favor of a wise bankrupt law, and I shall
              vote "no" on this resolution.</p>

            <p> The joint resolution was adopted by yeas, 56; nays, 30.</p>

              they state a question is a political one, all pairs shall be in force. He thought time

              with certainty in this way. </p>

            <p>Mr. YANCEY objected to appointing keepers of consciences for Senators. The opinion of
              no Chairman of any Committee would govern his action in such a matter. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR thought much time could be saved by the adoption of the

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS agreed with the remarks of the Senator from Hancock, Mr. Yancey.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD regarded the resolution as only calling from a statement on the question

            <p>Mr. BELL could see no objection to the resolution, and was sure it may save time. </p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS made the point of order that <pb n="57" xml:id="VAA8558-21-056"/> the
              resolution involved a question about which there should be no action by the Senate. It
              is bringing into this body a part of a caucus-a matter purely between Senators-and
              should not even be entered on the journal.</p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR suggested the names of the Senators be embraced in the

            <p>It was rejected upon a division-affirmative, 13; negative not counted, </p>

            <head rend="center">CONTRACTING CONVICT LABOR.</head>

            <p> Mr. JOHNSON offered the following:</p>

            <floatingText>
              <body>
                <div type="resolution">
                  <p>Whereas, The present system of letting out the labor of the convicts of our
                    Penitentiaries under a contract to the highest bidder has established in this
                    State and under the authority of the State in the State and under the authority
                    of the State a class of cheap labor;</p>

                  <p> Whereas, The employment of said convicts in various important manufacturies of
                    this State at the nominal contract price paid by the highest bidder, establishes
                    an unfair and injurious competition between the factories and workshops in which
                    such convicts are employed and the factories and workshops in which free and
                    respectable men are employed;</p>

                  <p>Whereas, The low and merely nominal prices paid by the contractors for the
                    labor of said Penitentiary convicts materially influence and lower the wages ot
                    the free laborers and workingmen employed in similar workshops and
                    factories;</p>

                  <p>Whereas, The very fact that the labor of a convict criminal and felon should be
                    permitted to enter into competition with the labor of a free and respectable
                    citizen, and diminish his ability to provide for family and educate his
                    children, is humiliating to the free laborer, and an injustice and a wrong to
                    his family;</p>

                  <p>Whereas, It is the duty of the State to protect both the material interests and
                    the dignity of the citizens; and</p>

                  <p>Whereas, The pretext of making our State Prisons self-sustaining by letting out
                    the labor of is no excuse for injuring the private rights and lowering the wages
                    of honest citizens;</p>

                  <p>Resolved, That the great wrong engendered by the present system of letting out
                    the labor of the convicts in our Penitentiaries under contract to the highest
                    bidder should be remedied as soon as possible;</p>

                  <p>Resolved, That a Special Committee of five members of the Senate be appointed
                    by the President of the Senate to devise means and plans to have the present
                    system of contract convict labor abolished; and at the same time to utilize the
                    labor of the convicts in such work and employment as may contribute to the
                    maintenance and pecuniary support of the Penitentiaries, but will not interfere
                    with or enter into competition with the labor and compensation of free laborers
                    and citizens.</p>

              </body>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON said: </p>

            <p>MR P<hi rend="sc">RESIDENT</hi>-In offering these resolutions not only give
              exoression to my own sentiments, but I voice the sentiments and opinions of a majority
              of the people of Indiana, and especially of those who are most interested in their
              adoption-the laborers and workingmen of the State. </p>

            <p>The pernicious system of letting out to the highest bidder the convicts of our
              Penitentiaries to work in various important branches of industry has grown to be so
              obnoxious to a majority of the citizens, its obvious injustice to manufacturers
              employing and compensating only free men and honest laborers, and the cruel wrong
              thereby inflicted on the latter, whose wages it diminishes and whose families it robs
              of their comforts-all these evils resulting from the system have of late attracted
              such general attention, and so loudly call for redress, that I felt the duty incumbent
              upon me to offer these resolutions, and lay the matter before this honorable body.</p>

            <p>This is not a party matter, it is a question in which the great mass of the people,
              the laboring and working classes, are interested, and which they want looked after and
              properly solved in this Legislature. All parties, indeed all fair minded and
              unprejudiced men who examine the question and the official reports concerning the
              workings and results of the system, come to the conclusion that it should be changed
              or entirely abolished. The contractor's price for coopers is forty-five cents per day
              for each man; chair makers and furniture makers are let out for from thirty cents to
              forty-five cents per day; shoe-makers for thirty-eight to fifty-three cents per day,
              while the contract price for cigarmakers is only thirty-five cents per day. At these
              figures contractors secure the services of many hundred able-bodied men, and make them
              work fully as hard and fully as long as the same class of free laboring men works In
              similar shops and factories. What is the result? The manufacturer employing convict
              labor can manufacture his furniture, his shoes, his cigars, and his barrels at from 30
              to 60 per cent cheaper than his competitor who employs free and honest laborers whom
              he must pay $1.50 or $1.75 a day, and frequently by underselling him drives him
              entirely out of the market. And who is the main sufferer? It is not the wealthy
              manufacturer who sees his sales decreased and his fat income diminished by the
              contractor's competition, but it is the Poor and hard-working laborer who has to live
              and support his family, to educate and bring up his children, and whose wages are
              often without this unfair competition, already scanty enough and inadequate for the
              payment of rent, clothing, provisions and wood. No, no, Mr. President, the laborer's
              wages should not be cut down by a felon' cheap labor, and an honest man's wife and
              family should not be deprived of their little comforts, much less the necessaries of
              life, because a wealthy contractor is lucky enough to secure a hundred criminals'
              labor for a nominal and ridiculous price. I appeal to this Senate to seek the remedy
              and to apply it to this enormous wrong. And therefore, I now move the adoption of the
              resolutions which I have had the honor to offer.</p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN heartily seconded the resolution. </p>

            <p>Mr BELL hoped the resolution would be adopted on its merits, and would be satisfied
              with the selection of the proposed Committee by the Chair.</p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS proposed to amend by inserting the words, "and inmates of Reformatory
              Schools and Benevolent Institutions," after the word "Penetentiaries" in the first
              resolution. The labor of pupils and inmates of these institutions is let out in this
              contract way, which is an outrage on the pupils as well as the laborers of the
              State.</p>

            <p>Mr JOHNSON accepted the amendment.</p>

            <p> Mr. YANCEY favored the resolution because it was pan of his platform. He favored the
              protection of honest labor, and insisted that labor institutions that employ labor
              should be protected.; </p>

            <p>The resolution was adopted, and the Lieutenant Governor made the Committee to consist
              of Messrs. Johnson, Foulke, Faulkner, Lindley and Ernest. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. MAGEE his concurrent resolution, offered on Friday, requesting the
              Secretary of War to order such an appropriation expended as will secure a commodious
              and safe harbor in Michigan City, was read, with a Committee report recommending its
              passage.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN spoke in favor of the resolution. The Secretary of War has been guilty of
              an arbitrary decision in withholding an appropriation for the only harbor in Indiana,
              as he understood the matter. The river and harbor bill of the last Congress was in
              some degree a steal, but this resolution should be adopted.</p>

            <p> Mr. WHITE also favored the passage of this resolution. The people of his section of
              the State desired very much to see something done to improve that harbor.</p>

            <pb n="58" xml:id="VAA8558-21-057"/>

            <head rend="center">SCHOOL FUND INTEREST.</head>

            <p>Mr. BRYANT, from the <orgName>Committee on County and Township Business</orgName>,
              reported back Mr. Andtrim's bill [H. R. 16] to regulate interest on school fund, with
              a recommendation that the same do pass.</p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, on the question of concuring in the report, said: The question was of too
              great importance to be hurried through in so summary a manner. This effort to reduce
              the school fund interest to 6 per cent. per annum wrests at one fell swop one-fourth
              of the proceeds of the mangnificent vested fund of the Indiana schools from the
              children of the State. We here assert that every dollar of this fund may be loaned at
              a much higher rate than 6 per cent.; abundant evidence is at hand to prove this. By
              the last of the week we will have reports from all the Counties in the State giving
              full information and for this reason we desire the subject recommitted to the
              Committee for further consideration.</p>

            <p> Mr. GORDON said: I hope gentlemen will not insist on concurring in the report of the
              Committee. Time out to be given to members to inform themselves as to the facts on
              this subject. It is one of the most important questions that will be before the House.
              I have been recently informed by the Auditor of my County that there are calls for the
              school funds at the present rate to take them out as fast as they are paid in, and I
              believe that when the facts are ascertained it will be found that largely more than
              half of the counties in the State will be found to have no funds unloaned.</p>

            <p> A motion being made to recommit the bill-</p>

            <p> Mr. JEWETT said: I hope the motion to recommit will be carried, and I will say to
              these gentlemen who desire the rate of interest in the school fund to be fixed at 6
              per cent that I am of like opinion. But my belief that the rate of interest should be
              6 per cent. rests upon the understanding I have up to this time had that the fund can
              not be loaned at a higher rate. I do not concur in this position of gentlemen that the
              rate of interest should be governed by the necessities of the borrow. It is our duty
              to so legislate as to make the school fund most productive. The State of Indiana does
              not propose to enter into competition with loan associations in the matter of cheap
              loans. Its whole concern is to preserve and make productive the Common School fund.
              If, therefore, by recommitting this bill we can be placed in possession of information
              that will lead to the conclusion that the money can be loaned at the present rate or
              at 7 per cent., I am ready to change my opinion, and have no doubt others will. We
              should proceed with deliberation.</p>

            <p> Mr. CABBAGE: I think this question is a plain question, and that 6 per cent. is
              enough to compel our people to pay. I think the question we are called on to decide is
              what is a just interest, and not what we could compel the people to pay. We have the
              power to put the rate of interest at 15 or 20 per cent. I think it would be wrong to
              make the honest yeomanry of the country pay any more than would be just for the man
              that borrows pays more than his share of tax, and the man that gives a mortgage on his
              land pays the same tax as though he had no mortgage on his land. According to this law
              the man that borrows pays double tax. There is no reason to delay this bill. Six per
              cent., in my judgment, is enough to make the borrower pay. High interest is
              destructive to the success of enterprising citizens of the State, I hope this House
              will not hesitate to vote for 6 per cent. interest. I think it not good policy to make
              the poor working people of the country pay more than their share of tax to keep up the
              State schools. It is unjust, and will not be of interest to the welfare of the schools
              of the State. It is not good statesmanship in my judgment. A farmer that has a
              mortgage on his farm is less able to send his children to school, and they are the men
              who borrow most of the school money. </p>

            <p> Mr. STERREIT said: I do hope that the motion to recommit will prevail. I do not
              believe that the members of this House are prepared to vote to lower the rate of
              interest on our school fund mortgages. At this time in my own County there is no money
              to be had on such loans at the present rate, and instead of lowering the rate some
              plain for the distribution of that fund from the Counties where it can not be loaned
              to places where the money on such loans are in excess of the supply. For that reason I
              shall favor recommitting the bill.</p>

            <p> Mr. PETTIBONE opposed the motion to refer the bill back to the Committee. There is
              $18,000 of school funds lying idle in the Treasury of his County for the reason that
              it can not be loaned at 8 per cent., because abundance of money can be borrowed to
              meet the wants of the people at 6 per cent. </p>

            <p>The bill and report was recommitted to the <orgName>Committee on County and Township
                Business</orgName>. </p>

            <p>The bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_150">H. R 150</ref>] in relation to the
              appointment of Judges of Criminal Courts, pro tempore, was read the second time.</p>

            <p>Mr VOYLES explained that it gives Judges of Criminal Courts authority to appoiut
              Judges pro tem., which they have no right to do under the present law. In the event of
              the judge becoming sick his Court would have to stop. He moved that the Constitutional
              rule be dispensed with that the bill may be pressed to the final vote today.</p>

            <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS hoped the bill would pass, it being a very necessary measure in his
              (Marion) County, inasmuch as the Criminal Court continues in session almost the entire
              year.</p>

            <p> The motion to suspend the Constitutional restriction was agreed to-yeas, 44; nays,
              0-and the bill was read the second time by title only and the third time by
              sections.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY thought the bill was too broad in that it authorizes the Judge to call a
              pro tem. at any time, and it might allow of the paying of two Judges at one time in
              the same circuit.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES suggested that point could be examined into during the dinner hour, and
              on his motion, it being about noon, the Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock.</p>

              either side.</p>

            <p> The amendment was agreed to without objection. The bill then finally passed the

                principal sewer in the city of Indianapolis (same as the bill [H. R 54]) being read
                the second time, with a Committee report favorable to its passage.</p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES moved to recommit the bill with instructions to fix definitely the
                proportion of the cost to be paid by the State.</p>

              <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS moved to amend the amendment by providing that ht eroute shall be
                reported.</p>

              <p> I Mr, VOYLES accepted the amendment. </p>

              <p> Mr. WILLARD moved to refer the bill to the <orgName>Committee on
                Finance</orgName>.</p>

              <p>Mr. BELL reminded Senators that for a number of years, there have been attempts
                made to secure a sewer from this institution. The sewage now flows by the United
                States Arsenal and through the city of Indianapolis. This bill may be faulty, is
                informed that this bill has been carefully framed, has the indorsements of the State
                and city authorities and some legal minds that have examined it. The State should
                bear a portion of the expense and so should the city. The power of determining the
                route is placed largely in the hands of the Governor. The merits of the bill can not
                but be acknowledged. The amendment for the location of the route is impracticable.
                It is apparent the State must abandon this institution or a bill of this kind must
                be enacted into a law. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD agreed with all said as to the necessity of legislation on this
                subject, but would not consent to the passage of a bill of this kind without a limit
                as to the amount. The proposition is, to lay a foundation for a lawsuit. The
                expenditure should be approximately estimated and desired the Committee, partially
                responsible for expenditures should consider this bill.</p>

              <p> Mi. VAN VORHIS did not desire to be understood as opposing the building of this
                sewer. This bill needs an appropriation of not less than $100,000. A route has
                already been surveyed and estimated to cost $80,000. There is now an increase in
                prices which will probably bring it up to $100,000. He did not believe the city
                wants to pay $50,000, as much as the institution is worth, probably. If the
                institution is maintained the sewer ought to be built. The bill passed in 1880 <pb
                  n="63" xml:id="VAA8558-21-062"/> prescribed the route and entire specifications,
                and made an appropriation not to exceed $40,000. In answer to a question why the
                sewer was not built, said there was a gentleman in the Council who had over 1,000
                feet on the line of the sewer, and through his influence, probably, the proposition
                to build the sewer was defeated. The selection of the route should be left with the
                City Civil Engineer.</p>

              <p> Mr. MARVIN saw no reason for sending this bill to the <orgName>Committee on
                  Finance</orgName>. This is an important measure, carefully drawn for the purpose
                of avoiding a law suit. He hoped this bill would have been printed before action was
                taken on it. </p>

              <p> Mr. VOYLES hoped the bill would be recommitted to the Committee which has already
                considered it. There ought to be an amendment as to the amount to be expended. </p>

              <p> Mr. BELL moved that this bill be made the special order for Monday at 2 o'clock,
                and 150 copies ordered printed.</p>

              <head rend="center">CONTEST OF JOHNSON VS. OVERSTREET</head>

              <p>Mr. McCULLOCH offered a resolution authorizing the <orgName>Committee on
                  Elections</orgName> to send for persons and papers and examine witnesses in the
                contest of Johnson vs. Overstreet.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN moved to strike out the word "witnesses" and insert words authorizing
                the taking of depositions an additional charge having been filed of bribery, and
                believing, under the protest filed against it, the Committee should not consider
                that charge. There is a remedy under the statute, and that not having been chosen,
                witnesses should not be sent for. That expense should not be allowed and can be
                avoided by the taking of depositions before the proper tribunals pointed out by law. </p>

              <p> Mr. BELL thought this matter of disqualification may be one of contest or
                otherwise. The matter has been considered by the Committee, which have concluded the
                contestee can file additional charges. There was a showing made excusing the not
                filing of this ground of contest earlier. The statute relative to contest of
                elections of this kind furnishes means by which testimony can be taken in advance of
                the meeting of the Legislature. Upon the filing of such a charge the Senate could by
                a resolution authorize the sending for persons and papers, in compliance with the
                provisions of the Constitution and one of the statutory grounds of contest. He would
                not agree that it is best to take depositions-to do that means a continuance and no
                determination of the question this session. He had no doubt of the regularity of the
                proceedings in this case thus far.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN spoke further in favor of his amendment, insisting it is better to
                comply wit the statutes in such cases mad and provided, which he read. The purpose
                of that l aw was to allow evidence to be taken at their own homes to save expense to
                the State. The resolution means to give unlimited power to bring every creditable
                witness in Johnson and Morgan Counties up here, which expense should be avoided. </p>

              <p> Mr. McCULLOCH stated, in response to an inquiry, that there are already probably
                over 100 depositions before the Committee.</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN, understanding the charge to be that the sitting Senator offered, and
                gave bribes to secure his election, contended that was not a ground for contest-if
                that charge be true the Senator is removed and there becomes a vacancy, but the
                contestor could not be seated. If it is found that the charge is true the seat is
                vacated. The Senate has already found there is sufficient to put the Senate on an
                inquiry as to whether the sitting Senator did offer or give bribes to secure his
                election. The Senate ought to go on and hear the proof, and this investigation
                should only o this charge. Having the witnesses brought face to face is certainly
                the best way, and is likely the most expedient. Every vote cast by a disqualified
                member is a factor that should be eliminated as speedily as possible if such is
                found to be the case.</p>

              <p> Mr. SAYRE did not understand any charge has been made authorizing any
                investigation as to the qualification of the sitting member; and he maintained until
                some charge is made that a Senator is here unfit to occupy his place. There is
                nothing before the Senate authorizing the sending for persons and paper. </p>

              <p> Mr. FOULKE contended that the proceedings indicated by the amendment of the
                Senator from Rush (Mr. Spann) is the only course pointed out by law. t is not the
                question whether the contestor shall be seated or not only, but whether the
                contestee is qualified to fill the seat. The question of this contest is the only
                one before the Committee, and they are bound by the statute in the mode of taking
                testimony.</p>

              <p> Mr. McCULLOCH considered there is no question, but the Senate has the right to
                send for witnesses in such a case and defied any Senator to show a word in the
                statue undertaking to prescribe how the Senate shall be governed as to the manner in
                which it shall obtain information in relation to a question in which it is to be the
                exclusive judge. The statute is not exclusive upon anything relating to this
                question nor to contests in cases of County officers. While the statute provides
                depositions may be taken it does not undertake to say that the better testimony
                shall be excluded for witnesses to be brought face to face before the accused and
                the tribunal. The resolution will tend to economy. If this evidence has to be taken
                by deposition, then days time and ten days notice will be necessary; justices will
                have to be recommissioned, and every one having experience knows the difficulty in
                having papers corrected by deposition. The Committee and Senate will be able to pass
                more justly upon testimony obtained from witnesses than otherwise. And whether
                expensive or not the Senate should adopt the rule that will tend to the most fair
                and just investigation. He moved a substitute for the whole matter, that the
                Committee be empowered to send for persons and papers to the end that the charge of
                bribery may be supported or negatived.</p>

              <p> On motion by Mr. SPANN, this matter was postponed till to-morrow at 10 o'clock a.

              <head rend="center">HON. THOMAS J. FOSTER-IN MEMORIAM</head>

              <p>Mr. BELL called up the special order, being his resolution concerning the death of
                ex-Senator Foster, offered Friday afternoon. After the resolution was read he said:
                My purpose in offering the resolution which has just been read is to place in a
                substantial manner upon the records of this Senate a tribute to the worth and
                character of my deceased colleague, Hon. Thomas J. Foster. it is not my purpose at
                this time to offer any extended eulogium upon the character or services of the
                deceased, but to pay my simple tribute of respect and esteem as a colleague and as a
                friend. Senator Foster was personally known to many members of the Senate, as he
                served with the min a preceding one, and I know they will agree with me that it is
                proper that such action as is proposed by this resolution should be taken on this
                occasion. Senator Foster died in early manhood. He had not the advantages of early
                education, nor the advantages that wealth brings. He was emphatically a self-made
                man. Born upon a farm, reared in comparative poverty, without the advantages to
                which I have referred, by his own energy, industry and ability, he attained a
                position which was an honorable one, indeed-a standing and influence in the
                community and in the State of which his family and friends may well fell proud. His
                character was such an one as finds opportunity for development and growth only under
                and surrounded by the benign influence of our free institutions and republican form
                of government. Under no other circum<pb n="64" xml:id="VAA8558-21-063"/>stances
                would persons, whatever their abilities, with such surroundings, be enabled to
                obtain such a position. and to leave an impress of his character and life upon the
                persons and time in which he lived. * * * * Mr. B concluded by saving: It is not
                necessary I should refer to the tragic manner of his death. It is sufficient to say
                that mysterious thing, the mind. whose constitution none of us can comprehend or
                understand, had become so affected by the ravages of disease as that its possessor
                was no longer responsible for his acts. In his death Indiana has lost a noble
                citizen, the community where he resided one of its best members, and every word in
                this resolution which is praise, as far as it concerns his character and services,
                can be truthfully sid I know not what more I could say on this occasion. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN, lest it be said there came from their side of the Chamber on this
                occasion no expression of respect, said a few words. He became acquainted with
                Senator Foster at the last session, who bad his likes and dislikes, was a man of
                large heart, generous, impulsive, a man of ability, and no man is equal in not
                yielding when in the right, but ready to acknowledge error when in the wrong. He was
                his own worst enemy; let us throw the mantle of charity over his faults and strive
                to shun them.</p>

              <p>The resolution was adopted by a rising vote. </p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. BUNDY, the Secretary was directed to send a copy of the
                resolutions to the family of ex-Senator Foster.</p>

            <p> Mr. Montgomery's [H. R. 97] to regulate and increase the jurisdiction of Justices of
              the Peace, being reported back with a Committee recommendation that it be indefinitely
              postponed.</p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT said: This report of the Committee was made because the Committee was
              unanimously of the opinion that any increase of the jurisdiction of Justifies would be
              unwise. My own opinion i that the jurisdiction should be curtailed rather than
              extended. In the first place those who are elected to the office of Justice of the
              Peace, while very excellent citizens, are as a rule without any considerable legal
              knowledge, and for that reason liable to err in judgment. These errors are harmful in
              proportion to the amount for which the wrong judgment Is rendered. But the strongest
              reason why the jurisdiction should not be increased arises from the fact that the
              records are so imperfectly made up and so exposed to loss or destruction. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY: The people of my County are anxious to extend the jurisdiction of
              Justices of the Peace, under proper restrictions. They feel that if there is any claps
              in the State that needs relief, is the debtor class, and that this bill will lessen
              the costs of proceedings in civil cases can not be doubted. If It will, it is
              certainly in the interest of the common people of the State, and ought to be
              adopted.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, said, the report of the Committee should be sustained; the
              jurisdiction of Justices should not be increased from $200 to $500. There are strong
              reasons against enlarging the present jurisdiction. </p>

            <p>Mr. DEEM said: I am decidedly in favor of increasing the jurisdiction of Justices of
              the Peace, in civil cases. Such a measure would tend to give the people cheaper
              litigation, and at the same time expedite the collection of just claims. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOCK thought the jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace is already too great.</p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, said: Being in favor of the stability of the laws and
              opposed to the obliteration of the established landmarks, and not knowing the full
              sweep of this amendment, I feel that I ought not to support the bill.</p>

            <p>Mr HEFFREN: I am opposed to the recommitment of this bill for several reasons, and am
              in favor of its indefinite postponement. I believe that Justices of the Peace have now
              a sufficient jurisdiction in civil cases. But one of my principal objections is that
              it is a bill to prevent appeals by poor men. A rich man can select his @wn Justice of
              the Peace, obtain a judgment against a poorman and however unjust, unless the poor man
              can give a bond of appeal, he is at the mercy of his creditor. </p>

            <p>Mr. MONTGOMERY said: I do hope the members will not concur in the report of the
              Committee. This bill, as you are aware, proposes to give Justices of the Peace
              jurisdiction in civil cases to the amount of $300 in litigation, and may confess
              judgment o the amount of $500. In my judgment this would greatly reduce the costs of
              litigation, and would greatly reduce the inconveniences of attending Court, where the
              same might be settled in our own Townships. </p>

            <p>Mr. WRIGHT said: There is no crying need er demand for enlarging the jurisdiction of
              Justices. The people of the State are not in favor of building a Court House in every
              Township in a County.</p>

            <p>The report was concurred in-yeas, 58; nays, 60. </p>

              <p>A Committe reported back Mr. Gilman's bill [H. R. 19] declaring agreement to pay
                costs of collection or attorneys' fees contained in any bill of exchange,
                acceptances, drafts, promissory notes or other written evidence of indebtedness,
                illegal and void and making it the duty of the owner when suit is brought for
                collection to render judgment accordingly, with recommendation that the same be
                indefinitely postponed. </p>

              <p>Mr. GILMAN said: My objection to the report of the Committee to postpone
                indefinitely is that the interest of the people, both creditor and debtor, and the
                attorneys themselves demand reform in the attorneys' fee law as at present
                administered. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILEY said: The principle of the bill under consideration is, in my naiad,
                manifestly unjust, and should not become a law. </p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT said: If the gentlemen will move to recommit this bill to our Committee,
                with instructions to amend the bill so as to make all agreements to pay more than 5
                per cent illegal, and that no amount shall be allowed unless the amount has been
                actually paid to the attorney, I will vote for his motion, and gladly assist in

            <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR stated this question to be on the substitute pending at the
              adjournment last evening authorizing the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName> to
              send for persons and papers necessary to support or negative the charge of bribery
              made against Senator Overstreet. </p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN insisted the Committee had no need of the power sought for in this
              resolution. A party charged with disqualification should be brought before the Bar of
              the Senate. Under the statute the issue is on ineligibility. The Committee ought to
              hear nothing in this case except as to the contest. If Senator Overstreet is arraigned
              before the Bar of the Senate, he is ready to meet the charge. If the Committee should
              find the Senator guilty of bribery, although unseating him, it would not seat Mr.
              Johnson. It looks like the purpose is, under cover, to gather evidence to bolster up
              the contest for the seat. The law says the contestor and contestee shall bear the
              expense of the contest themselves. The law evidently intended that evidence should be
              taken entirely before the Commission provided by law, and should there be closed to
              all intents and purposes, and the Commission of Justices for the purposes of taking
              the deposition has expired. He spoke further against the adoption of the substitute. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD considered this a purely legal question, and could see no reason for
              excitement in its discussion. He regarded the question to go as far as to
              ineligibility, The statute distinctly provides for cases like this. It is clearly
              within the province of the Committee to inquire into the eligibility of the sitting
              member. The Senate is a Court having exclusive jurisdiction as to the qualifications
              of its own members. The English rule has been well settled, and there is no variance
              from that rule where the majority candidate is ineligibile, the candidate receiving
              the next highest number of votes is entitled to the seat. He read from XIV Ind , page
              93, where there was ineligibility on account of holding a judicial office. The
              question narrows down to this: Did a sufficient number of the voters in this contest
              have knowledge of the charge of of bribery? It is the purpose of the resolution I(P i
              quire into that matter. If there be no notice then there is no cause of removal on
              that charge. Will you deny the right of having evidence on this subject? It can not be
              told how long it will take to obtain necessary depositions, and the Senate or the
              House has power at all times to send for persons and papers He could not, understand
              why Senators on the other side are unwilling to have the matter thoroughly
              investigated. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES thought the discussion had taken a wider range than is proper at this
              stage of the proceeding. The inquiry is narrowed down to the one question of bribery.
              He favored, if evidence is heard at all, that witnesses should be sent for. Their
              bearing and consistency upon the stand should be observed. The taking of depositions
              might be made almost interminable. All material evidence can soon be obtained by
              sending for witnesses, and the losing party having to pay the cost. No more witnesses
              would be sent for than are necessary. After grounds have been filed in s contest under
              the statute, the contestor has the right to present supplemental ground where he shows
              a good excuse for not filing the same in the proper time No respectable authority will
              deny the right to amend or supplement such complaint. If it be true a bribe was given
              by the sitting member and known to a number of voters sufficient to change the result,
              the contestor would be entitled to a seat. This is a question of fact. </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY insisted the argument of the Senator from Rush [Mr Spann] has not and can
              not be answered. The question pending "before the Committee is in the nature of a
              contest. That is the matter referred to the Committee, and not a question of
              bribery-that has not been referred to the Committee. The pending resolution asks
              authority to send for persons and papers, that evidence may be taken to support and
              negative a charge of bribery. A Committee has no power except to answer questions
              referred to it, and that question was not referred as a charge of bribery, but as an
              additional ground of con lest. Bribery Is not a cause of contest under the statute in
              an election to the General Assembly. There is a difference between the question of
              ineligibility and the question of qualification. The object of the <pb n="67"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-066"/> resolution is evidently to make the State of Indiana pay
              the expense, instead of letting it fall upon the parties to the contest. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN sent to the Clerk's desk and had read the supplemental cause of contest
              discovering a new cause, viz: the second statutory cause-said contestee did offer and
              give a bribe of money to secure his election. He said: That paper shows it was
              intended to be regarded as additional ground; and it is double-to much as recites the
              fact as to the majority of votes cast is in the nature of a contest; but so much as
              refers to the bribe, that act has placed a bar of disqualification as to holding
              office. If the sitting Senator is proved to have given a bribe to secure the position,
              that does not seat the contestor. This has been settled after discussion ten years ago
              in this Senate, and the person asking for the seat then did not claim it. There can
              not be a single case shown in the annals of legislative bodies where a man has been
              turned out and the man who ran against him the one turned out seated. This discussion
              ought not to have come at this early time. It has been brought to the notice of the
              Senate, by the solemn oath of a citizen, that a sitting member is disqualified by
              giving a bribe or offering a bribe-that we take notice of it on our own account
              entirely. If that be proved true the seat becomes vacant. That is the universal rule
              everywhere. The question of disqualification can be heard at the same time with the
              questions of contest, and therefore it is proper to adopt the resolution. In the case
              before the Senate ten or twelve years ago, not a single deposition was taken. Those
              friendly to the sitting member should not seek to stop the most full and fair
              investigation.</p>

            <p> Mr. GRAHAM said the Senator from Johnson [Mr. Overstreet] cares nothing, personally,
              whether he retains the seat or not, though honestly and fairly elected to this body;
              but he cares for his reputatation, which is attacked in a manner not warranted by law
              and the facts in the case. The Committee can not find any ground for contest under the
              statute the specifications can not be sustained by evidence, even in the hands of a
              Democratic majority. It is attempted to bring in this case a charge of bribery, which
              is not a ground for contest. The arguments of Senators on the other side can not be
              understood until the vote shall be taken. The law making power ought to be as fair in
              dealing with citizens as the Courts of the land are. How long would this charge stand
              under a motion to quash? Not a Justice of the Peace in the land would allow a case to
              go to trial under a charge of this kind. If there is a charge of bribery in the paper
              referred to, it could have been made specifically. The charge is too indefinite, and
              for many reasons the resolution should not be adopted. Let this case be fairly tried,
              and tried only upon the questions in issue. Let not anything be irregularly tacked on
              a proceeding in a case of contest.</p>

            <p> Mr. McCULLOCH. in reply to a question, stated the papers came regularly in the hands
              of the Committee, and whether the additional paper be considered as a memorial or an
              additional cause of contest, it is the duty of the Committee to ascertain the facts in
              the case. The question as to whether the contestor is entitled to a seat or not does
              not first arise; the first question is, can the grounds of contest be sustained? The
              subsequent paper came to the Committee in the regular way, and no resolution or
              request has been made for its return to the Senate. The two questions may be tried
              together. The matter is before the Committee. It is the duty of the Committee to
              investigate and report it, and then the Senate can act as it deems fit. The pending
              resolution goes to the charge of bribery. It won't do for the Senate to say when a
              charge is made that a member has been guilty of bribery that the Senate must not take
              action, nor should we simply convict the member on depositions; but rather we should
              send for witnesses and weigh testimony. It is due to the member against whom the
              charge is made that the Committee should have the witnessees meet the Senator face to
              face. We would favor brining the witnesses before the whole Senate that each member
              may weigh the testimony for himself.</p>

            <p> Mr. SAYRE thought under the view presented by the Senator from Gibson [Mr.
              McColloch] the resolution should not be adopted. The supplemental charge is not a
              ground for contest. The investigation should not be had on the grounds before the
              Senate as no time, person or place is set forth. The forms of law should be observed
              here as well as in the Courts of Justice. The meanest tramp should not beheld on such
              a charge before the most incompetent Justice of the Peace in the State. </p>

            <p> Mr. McCOLLOCH and Mr. BELL demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the
              Senate-yeas, 27; nays, 20-and under its operations the substitute was adopted by yeas,
              26; nays, 20, and the resolution as amended was adopted without a division.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY, when his name was called, saying he concurred in the position taken by
              the Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown] that the charge of bribery ought to be
              investigated when properly presented, but considering that this charge ought not to go
              to the Committee on the original ground of contest, he should vote "no."</p>

            <p> Mr. HOOVER, when his name was called, declined to vote because of his pair with the
              Senator from St. Joseph [Mr. Campbell, absent on account of sickness] on all political
              questions.</p>

            <p> [On motion of Mr. MAGEE the courtesies of the Senate were extended to Hons. William
              McKee Dunn and John M. Foster.]</p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN offered a resolution to instruct the <orgName>Committee on
                Elections</orgName> to make a separate report on the additional causes of contest
              charging Senator Overstreet with bribery, and hear full, complete and searching
              evidence on that charge, disconnected and independently of the contest now pending
              between Overstreet and Johnson.</p>

            <p> Pending which, came the recess for dinner. </p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>Mr. SPANN offered the pending resolution with a desire to divide the question and
              place it in a position that will be fair to the Senator from Johnson, Mr.
              Overstreet.</p>

            <p> Mr. BELL thought this will be in advance attempting to determine a legal proposition
              which may prove embarrassing. If knowledge is brought home to enough of the voters to
              determine the result, the contestor would be entitled to the seat. So he oppossen the
              attempt to circumscribe the action of the Committee as proposed in the pending
              resolution. The inquiry will necessarily have to be taken separately, the testimony
              being oral. He knew nothing of the merits in this controversy, not having even talked
              about it with contestor or contestee, or either of their attorneys. The resolution
              already adopted is the only one that should go before the Committee to which the
              question may be safely left. </p>

            <p> Mr. FOULKE moved to amend by instructing the Committee to require the contestant to
              specify the persons to whom and the things offered as a bribe in each case, etc., etc.
              Senators on the other side have spoken about this not being a political matter, yet it
              seems a curious thing that even in preliminary matters we divide exactly at the party
              line. In this matter it may be well for them not to go too far. The Democratic
              Senators voted to a man this morning in favor of the demand for the previous question,
              thus stopping further debate. It is not enough to show that one or two or three voters
              had notice of a bribe. He desired a full and fair investigation, and by his vote no
              man shall retain a seat here who has blistered a hand with giving a bribe to secure an
              election. We must be governed by ordinary rules of legal procedure. Witnesses may be
              obtained <pb n="68" xml:id="VAA8558-21-067"/> and suborned, and the sitting member may
              not know the charge till it is spoken by the mouth of the witness. No man should be
              called to answer an infamous crime without full knowledge of the charge in every
              particular item.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN: The statement that the sitting member has been guilty of offering and
              giving bribes is in exact accord with the precedents in this State. To the end that we
              may make some honest effort tot do something in this case before being called from
              time to eternity, he moved to lay the resolution on the table.</p>

            <p> The motion was agreed to by yeas, 24; nays 19.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN offered a preamble and resolution requiring the informer to make specific
              terms as to the charge of bribery; requiring a return of the paper making a charge of
              bribery from the Committee, and that this inquiry be before the entire Senate in
                <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>. In supporting which, he remarked: It has
              been said by a Senator on the other side that these witnesses were desired in order to
              bring them face to face. Now in all fairness he demanded that witnesses shall be
              brought before the face of every Senator, and not that the evidence shall be taken
              before a Committee composed largely of Senators of opposite politics. </p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN liked the old way the best. There never was a time in the history of
              Indiana when the action proposed by this resolution has been resorted to. He moved to
              lay the motion on the table.</p>

            <p> This motion was agreed to by yeas, 26; nays, 19. </p>


            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">VERBAL FALSE PRETENSE.</head>

              <p>Mr. Ernest's bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_012">S. 12</ref>] to define the
                crime of false pretense coming up in regular order, it was read the third time.</p>

              <p> On motion of Mr. BROWN the emergency clause was stricken out.</p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY opposed the passage of the bill, stating the proposed change is to allow
                any person to be convicted by making any false pretense, even under a verbal
                presentation, the law being now that it must be under a written pretense. He opposed
                allowing the criminal law to be used by persons to force the collection of a debt;
                as would be the case under an act such as proposed by this bill.</p>

              <p> Mr. BELL favored the bill. It simply places the law back to where it was previous
                to 1881, and he regarded it as an omission by mistake. He saw no reason why the
                getting of money or goods by verbal false pretense should not be punishable. Another
                change proposed is imprisonment from one to seven instead of from two to ten, as
                now.</p>

              <p>Mr FOULKE joined in the desire that the bill may pass. Under the present law a
                party can be punished only where the false pretense is written, while in the bill
                the punishment is also for oral false pretense. The fact a law may be abused is no
                reason why a good and salutary law should not be enacted. There is a hiatus in the
                present law that ought to be filled, and this will fill it. </p>

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM has noticed that under the law of 1881 the people are left without
                remedy from a class of swindlers. He could conceive of no case where this bill would
                interfere with the rights of an honest man. </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY remembered this clause was left out of the code at the last session on
                purpose, and it ought to remain out. It persons would ask for the representation to
                be put in writing they can be protected under the law as it now is. The law is right
                as it stands, because the question of conviction is in writing and does not depend
                upon the testimony of persons who may be angry. </p>

              <p>The bill finally passed the Senate by yeas, 33; nays, 13. </p>

              <p>[Messrs. Spann and Voyles were appointed a Committee to invite Mexican soldiers to
                visit the Senate Chamber on motion of the former. ] </p>

                page 29 of the Brevier Reports), with an amendment adopted heretofore allowing 2
                percentum of each $100 valuation, being read the third time-</p>

              <p>Mr. SAYRE objected to the 2 percentum tax-the entire legal limit-being permitted
                for the buildup of gravel roads</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD made the point of order that the bill does not refer to the section of

                the qualification of Petit Jurors was read the third time.</p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY said the bill was the re-enactment of a law of 1875 or 1877. There is a
                question whether it is in force or not. This law is held to be repealed by
                implication. </p>

              <p>Mr. BELL thought the provisions of this bill commends itself to everybody. It
                strikes at the professional Juror, who, under this bill can only get one strike a
                year at you anyhow. </p>

              <p>Mr. OVERSTREET spoke a few words in favor of his bill, inaudible at the reporter's
                table.</p>

              <p>The bill passed the Senate-yeas, 39; nays, 3.</p>

              <p>The Senate Committee on Invitation appeared with the Mexican veterans, who were
                received by Senators standing. General Mahlon D. Manson, the Preside of the
                Association, responded to the welcome address of the Lieutenant Governor. Speeches
                were also made by Major Jonathan W. Gordon and Governor Porter. On Major James B.
                Mulkey's motion, and by a vote of the veterans present, Governor Porter and
                Lieutenant Governor Hanna were made honorary members of the Association, and

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of personal privilege. I hold in
              my hands a copy of this morning's Journal in which is an article entitled "After Many
              Years," purporting to come from the pen of General Reub Williams, in the Warsaw Times.
              All I have to say at present is that most of the article is a tissue of falsehoods, as
              the public record will show. It is true that I wis arrested and confined in a
              Government Prison for thirty four days; that I was put upon trial and discharged. It
              is further true, but not stated in said article, that afterward the Supreme Court of
              the United States decided that the trial was illegal and that the Military Commission
              had no jurisdiction nor right to try me. It is also true that a majority of the
              Justices of the Supreme <pb n="69" xml:id="VAA8558-21-068"/> Court were Republicans,
              making that decision. When I was incarcerated I only weighed 180 pounds, but that
              imprisonment; so ground the Democracy that was in me, that it permeated my whole
              system and gave me a new growth, until now I tip the beam at 390 pounds. If occasion
              requires, I may go into the whole matter, but at present I have only to ask General
              Reub Williams, the Indianapolis Journal and the Republican party generally: "Supposing
              all this be true, What are you. going to do about it?" [Applause.] </p>

              recommending that it lie on the table.</p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE considered that bill an important one. Though objectionable in some

              Institutions of the State be indefinitely postponed.</p>

            <p> Mr. MARVIN stated a majority of the Committee were not ready to report, and actio
              nshould not be taken till then.</p>

            <p> Mr. McCLURE thought this an extraordinary procedure to present the minority in
              advance of the majority report. It seems difficult to get the Committee together, and
              he much preferred this matter be delayed until the Committee are ready to report.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES regarded this action as out of place.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN deemed it entirely in order it being understood a majority would report
              this morning. A majority should not stop action by withholding their report. He
              understood Senators on the other side are in some trouble as to what they will do.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES thought it not courtesy to present a minority report and move its
              adoption before a majority of the Committee make report. So as to give time, he moved
              to lay the minority report upon the table.</p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE raised the point of order that the minority report unaccompanied by a
              majority report is out of order.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN asked leave to withdraw the report, but objection being made- </p>

            <p> The PRESIDENT pro tem. [Mr. Sayre in the Chair] declared the point of order well
              taken, and that a matter in the possession of the Senate can not be withdrawn over
              objection.</p>

            <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS dissented from the ruling of the Chair.</p>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY said the minority report was presented for action, and no action being
              taken the report could be withdrawn by the member offering it.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD called up his resolution submitted on Tuesday, the 6th inst., as follows: </p>

            <floatingText>
              <body>
                <div type="resolution">
                  <p>Resolved, That the <orgName>Committee on Public Buildings and State
                      Library</orgName> be and are hereby instructed to inquire into the present
                    condition of the new State House, and examine thoroughly the needs of the
                    commissioners and contractors of said building, and report to this House, either
                    by bill or otherwise; and said Committee is hereby duly empowered and authorized
                    to send for all necessary papers and persons to accomplish a full and complete
                    investigation of said matters. </p>
                </div>
              </body>
            </floatingText>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD moved the adoption of this resolution and said that since the resolution
              was offered the Lieutenant Governor has assigned to this Committee all that part of
              the Governor's message referring to the new State House, thus making the Committee
              partially responsible for the Senate's action on that subject. The Committee
              unanimously think it should have an opportunity to make a full examination of the
              facts in the case. There is no question of more importance before this body than the
              new State House matter.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN remembered the Senator from Lawrence [Mr. Willard] opposed a resolution
              some time since for a special Committee on this subject, and could not understand the
              zeal of that Senator now in this matter. </p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN favored the contractors being held strictly to the performance of their
              contract, and did not think the Senate would vote them $800,000 bonus-he would not
              vote a single dollar. The Senate not being full this morning he moved a postponement
              of this matter till Monday at 2 o'clock. </p>

            <p>Mr. YANCEY thought the resolution should meet with respectful consideration. The
              contractors want to steal some $750,000, as he understood it (to use plain English),
              and the State House Commissioners' report shows about that deficiency.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD could see no force in the remark that the Senate is not full at this
              time, and as this matter has now been delayed for some two weeks he counseled action
              at once. </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE favored the resolution. The Senate is probably as full now as it will be
              next Monday. It is the duty of that Committee to take into consideration the subjects
              contained in the Governor's message, where it is given to be understood that the
              contractors are about to give up their contract. The State House had better remain as
              it is for twenty years than for it to go out that the contractors shall not be held to
              their contract. </p>

            <p>Mr BROWN withdrew his motion to postpone. </p>

            <p>The resolution was adopted.</p>

            <p>The Senate took a recess until 2 o'clock. </p>

              <head rend="center">THE KANKAKEE SURVEY.</head>

              <p> On motion by Mr. HILLIGASS, the resolution to authorize the printing of 1,000
                copies of report of the survey of the Kankakee region was read with a Committee
                recommendation that the number be made 3,000.</p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES said no necessity for printing so many as 3,000 copies-not more than 200
                would be read.</p>

              <p>Mr. RISTINE: The whole purpose of the appropriation by the last General Assembly
                was to furnish information of that region. It interests a large portion of the
                State, and there is a demand for the n umber of copies proposed, and the extra
                copies can be furnished at comparatively small cost.</p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES did not think the State should drain the large area of territory
                proposed in this report. He thought one-third the number of copies named would
                supply the demand. </p>

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM favored the printing of 3,000 copies. This is a matter of interest to
                the people of the entire State, and that large section of the country should be made
                productive-to do which might be a good investment for the State. He has been called
                upon for at least fifty copies. The plate from which the map was printed has been
                preserved and the cost of printing the extra copies will be comparatively trivial. </p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY also favored concurrence in the report of the Committee. If there is
                anybody interested in obtaining this information, it is poor economy not to have a
                sufficient number of copies printed to supply the demand. It is a question whether
                it would be such a great benefit to the State at large that the State should bear a
                portion of the expense of reclaiming the vast amount of waste land in that region,
                and whether the United States should not also bear a part of the expense. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN moved to amend the report by directing that the copies be distributed
                among the members of both House and Senate. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to recommit the resolution to the <orgName>Committee on
                  Printing</orgName>, with instructions to report the cost of printing. </p>

              <p>Mr. HILLIGASS said but 500 copies were printed There remains unexpended. $376 30 of
                the $5 000 appropriated by the last General Assembly for this survey. The Bureau of
                Public Printing have stated the cost of printing will be for the first 1,000, $70,
                and $49 50 for each additional 1,000, making the 3,090 cost $169 12. He favored
                printing the 3,000. </p>

              <p>Mr. YANCEY would be willing to vote most any amount to draining the land if it
                belonged to the State; but as these funds belonged to private corporations and
                individuals, he opposed expending the State's money for such purpose. He believed
                this whole thing a garb upon the purse strings of the State. </p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN hoped the Senate would proceed to the discussion of a more interesting
                question, and moved the previous question. </p>

              <p>The demand for the previous question being seconded, under its operations, the
                motion to recommit with instructions [Mr. Willard's] was rejected by yeas, 38; nays,
                24.</p>

              <p>The amendment [Mr Spann's] to the report of the Committee was agreed to.</p>

              <p>The report of the Committee was then concurred in by yeas, 24; nays, 22.</p>

              <p>The resolution, as amended, was agreed to. </p>

            <head rend="center">THE LAW OF LIBEL </head>

            <p>Mr. McMULLEN, from a majority of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned
              Mr. Patton's [H. R. 36] to amend certain sections of an act concerning public
              offenses-to make libel a civil offense; with a recommendation that it pass with
              certain amendments. A minority report from the same Committee recommended the striking
              out of Section 10, the present law. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY said: It seems to me that the reason these standing Committees are
              appointed is in reference to their fatness, and it certainly seems to me that we
              should give some consideration to their recommendation. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH said: What the gentleman says is very pertinent, but I am a little like
              Andrew Jackson, who said, when asked if he had not worn to support the Constitution,
              said I swore to support the Constitution as I understood it. He desired an explanation
              of the provisions of the bill before voting on it. </p>

            <p>Mr. McMULLEN said: I think if the gentleman from Tippecanoe [Mr. Smith] will not
              insist on the reading of the bill I can briefly explain the changes proposed, and
              thereby save the time that would be consumed by the reading The first section proposes
              a change in the existing law in this: the present statute makes it embezzlement for a
              tenant to appropriate to his own use, with Intent to defraud his landlord, the share
              of the crop belonging to the landlord. Under the present statute an indictment will
              net lie unless the whole crop is appropriated. The amendment reported by the Committee
              makes it embezzlement to thus appropriate $25 worth of a crop. The amendment reported
              by the Committee to Section 2 takes out of the present statute but part of what is
              known as the provoke law, making it a misdemeanor to attempt to provoke another to
              commit a breach of the peace. Sections 4 5. 6, 7, and 8 seek to amend the game laws by
              allowing seining and netting fish and trapping and otherwise killing quails. The
              Committee believe the present laws are better than the proposed bill, and therefore
              ask that the said Section be stricken out. Your Committee has reported in favor of
              Section 9 of this bill, for the reason that the Statutes of 1881 leave out the words,
              "or any false pretense," and this bill seeks to re-enact the statute as it is found in
              the statutes of 1876. Our Supreme Court, in a late case that will be reported in 8lst
              Indiana, came to the conclusion that under the statute as it now is, an indictment
              will not lie unless the false pretense is a false token or writing. The bill seeks to
              remedy that matter by enacting that if a person obtain anything of value by false
              verbal misrepresentation, he shall be punished. Section 2 of this bill seeks to repeal
              the libel act. Your Committee believes that the existing act is a statutory law and
              should not be repealed. We believe that persons pecuniarily irresponsible can be
              reached in no other way than through this act A judgment in an action of slander
              avails nothing, and if this statute is repealed DO remedy is left. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN said: I am in favor of repealing this libel law; that is, the law that
              makes it criminal to write and print libel. It think it is contrary to the spirit of
              our Constitution. For sixty years the State of Indiana existed without criminal libel,
              and it was only four years ago that it was incorporated in the statutes of Indiana.
              All men who attempt to do what is right need no such law as this to protect them.
              Today libel stands upon the same footing as that of slander. I think if it is right to
              make criminal libel it is right to make criminal slander. I think it is proper that we
              should have press criticism. Let the newspapers lay on the lash to every scoundrel in
              Indiana. An honest man invites criticism at all times. The newspapers are the
              schoolmasters to educate the people. I think this is a law that ought to be repealed.
              I hope that this House will wipe it out of existence. Every man in this House is
              willing to stand upon his own character, and as one Representative I am willing to be
              criticised. </p>

              <head rend="center">JURY TRIALS.</head>

              <p> Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, from a majority of the <orgName>Judiciary
                  Committee</orgName>, reported back Mr. Adams' bill [H. R. 74] to amend Section 372
                of the civil procedure act, approved April 7, 1881, being Section 409 of the Revised
                Statute of 1881, with the recommendation that further action on the bill be
                indefinitely postponed. The minority of the same Committee submitted a report
                recommending that the bill to pass. </p>

              <p>Mr. ADAMS said: I believe the report of the minority of this Committee ought to
                prevail, because I believe that if a Jury is competent to try a question of fact in
                one case it is in all cases. If a Jury is competent to try fraud in the execution of
                a note it is competent to try the same question with reference to the foreclosure of
                a mortgage. If a Jury can try fraud in a horse trade it can in a land trade. If a
                Jury is competent to try me for my life or my liberty it is competent to try me for
                my property or my money. There must have been somebody interested in the change of
                the rule that stood for nearly thirty years, and I can conceive of no people whose
                interest it affects sa much as the smart gentlemen who go over the country swindling
                men into the execution of mortgages through some fraud perpetrated upon them, and
                then denying them the right of a trial by a Jury of the citizens of their County. </p>

              <p>Mr. MOCK: I believe in the minority report. I do not think it is right to leave it
                to the discretion of the Judge to say whether a man shall have a right to a Jury
                trial or not. If this minority report is adopted it will confer no greater right to
                any one for a trial by Jury than it did up to 1881. I believe that the law prior to
                1881 was better than it, is now. </p>

              <p>Mr. PATTEN: I do not see why, if a Jury has the right to try one case, why not let
                them try all cases. I am in favor of the minority report.</p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT: I think no man ought to vote for this minority report, and I hope that
                it will be voted down. It will almost double the length of our Courts should it
                prevail, and thereby incur a double expense to the taxpayers of the State. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILEY: As one of the members of <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> who
                signed the minority report, and believing it ought to prevail, I want to say just a
                few words. I can not coincide with the views of the gentleman from Scott [Mr.
                Jewett]. He seems to think that the minority report should <pb n="75"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-21-074"/> not prevail, because it would increase litigation and
                incur burdens upon the people by way of additional taxation. It does not seem to me
                to be in keeping with the spirit of our laws to let the question of dollars and
                cents interfere with the administration of justice. We must not measure the rights
                of citizenship by what the administration of justice costs. It is too small a
                measure. Rights, which belong to us as a people, must not be compassed by a question
                of expense. I believe the minority report ought to prevail, because the bill
                introduced by the gentleman from Morgan seeks to put every citizen upon. an equality
                in Courts of justice, and simply guarantees to every one a right which was
                acknowledged by the Code when the distinction between actions at law and proceedings
                in equity were abolished. As long as we have the Jury system, I am of the firm
                conviction that it is not right to deprive any citizen of the privilege of a trial
                by a Jury of his peers on any question of fact, and hence most heartily support the
                minority report. </p>

              <p> Mr. GORDON: Nearly thirty years ago our code of civil procedure was adopted. By
                that code, as it stood until 1881, all questions of fact were triable by Jury. That
                plan worked well. The code established all distinctions between proceedings at law
                and in equity. The change made two years ago was a step backward; a step toward
                establishing the distinction abolished by the code. The litigants ought to decide
                whether they will try by Jury or not. Will the gentleman from Knox (Mr. Williams)
                give us anything like a definite idea as to what matters are triable by Jury as the
                law now stands? I am in favor of the the minority report.</p>

              <p>Mr. FRAZER said: We have thus far tried to give stability to our laws, and not to
                suit the whim and fancy of some members. If gentlemen will examine the statute, they
                will find that there is no question of fact that may not be tried by Jury.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, thought it would be going back to adopt the minority
                report.</p>

              <p> The minority report was rejected-yeas, 60; nays, 35. The majority report, as
                amended by the minority report, was adopted.</p>

              <p>Mr. MOCK, from the <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName>, reported
                back Mr. Campbell's bill [H. R. 146] to restrain certain animals from running at
                large, with the recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed. </p>

              <p>After discussion thereon, the report was concurred in.</p>

              <p>The House adjourned. </p>

              that either House referred or intended to refer any proposition to amend the
              Constitution to this Assembly. The report was signed by Messrs. Spans, Bell, Brown,
              McCullough and Van Vorhis.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY, from the minority of said Committee, reported the en tries as found on the

              proposing to amend the Constitution as on the file in the Secretary of State's office,
              and published in the laws. It did not find they were referred to this General Assembly
              in words on the journal of either House, but the provisions of the Constitution have

              conformation by the Senate, forthwith.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN stated that this resolution casts a reflection on the Committee. The
              Committee had a meeting and unanimously agreed to adjourn to a meeting to-day. He
              moved to lay the resolution on the table. </p>

            <p>The resolution was rejected by yeas, 19; nays. 20-the Lieutenant Governor giving the

            <p>Mr. BENZ explaining his negative vote because the Committee has had plenty of time to
              consider this matter.</p>

            <p>Mr. RAHM when his name was called, said he <pb n="77" xml:id="VAA8558-21-076"/> did
              not consider this a political question. He remembered two years apo when the
              Republicans had a majority on this Committee it made no report till late in January,
              and he could nor see why they will not give us the same chance now.</p>

            <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>

            <p>So the motion to lay on the table was rejected.</p>

            <p>The resolution was then adopted by yeas, 20; nays, 19-the Lieutenant Governor giving
              the casting vote again. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENENT GOVERNOR announced the first thing in order to be the report of the
                <orgName>Committee on Executive Appointments</orgName>.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN: Does the Chair decide that the Senate must stand in statue quo until that
              Committee reports? </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: No: but I would like to hear from the Chairman of the
              Committee on Executive Appointments. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN: The Committee is not prepared to report now. And I will say to the Senator
              from Rush [Mr. Spann] that I don't think his course has added anything to the speed of
              that Committee, either. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR; Senator Dun- can the Senator from Brown, is the Chairman of
              the <orgName>Committee on Executive Appointments</orgName>. Let us hear from him. </p>

            <p>Mr. DUNCAN: There is an announcement on your desk for a meeting of that Committee
              to-night. I sent it up about a half hour or an hour ago I will say this, as one member
              of that Committee, that I think our meeting to-night will satisfactorily comply with
              the resolution. </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY moved that time be given the Committee till 2 o'clock to-day.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to amend till 10:15 o'clock to-morrow morning. The Committee has
              adjourned till this evening, and the members can not well be gotten together before
              then. I will say, so far as Senate bill No. 1 is concerned, no action will be taken
              to-day, if that is what is worrying Senators on that side. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN: We are after the question as to whether the <orgName>Committee on
                Executive Appointments</orgName> will report at once.</p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: It is the opinion of the Chair that the Committee ought to
              report immediately. Of course If the Senate gives It further time that is another
              matter.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN insisted on his motion to give the Committee until 10:15 to-morrow to
              report. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN made the point of order that this motion is out of order, as it conflicts
              with the resolution just adopted by the Senate. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I think that point of order is well taken. Of course if the
              Senate will give consent to pass it over the Chair will let it go. </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY: I think the Committee can mate a report by 2 o'clock to-day.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE: I voted in the affirmative on the resolution requiring the
                <orgName>Committee on Executive Appointments</orgName> to report at once, but in
              order to give this Committee time, at the request of some of its members, I move to
              reconsider that vote. This motion was agreed to by yeas, 26; nays, 17.</p>

            <p>The question now recurring on the resolution Mr. BROWN moved to amend the resolution
              by requiring the Committee to report at 10:15 to-morrow. </p>

            <p>The amendment was accepted by Mr. Spann. </p>

              <p>Mr. Benz's bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_006">S. 6</ref>] for the election of
                Supervisors of Highways (see page 28 of the Brevier Reports), was read the second
                time, with a majority Committee report that it be amended, also a minority report
                amending the title and substituting new matter for the entire bill.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD raised the point of order that the minority report is out of order
                because unconstitutional and unparliamentary.</p>

              <p>Mr. RISTINE understood a minority report can be made in this way. The bill proposes
                the re-enactment of the laws of 1877 with a change in the hours constituting a day's
                work. The minority report substitutes a bill [Mr. Voyles' S. 40] proposing to amend
                the present laws by excepting bridges, etc., under the control of gravel and toll
                roads; and it leaves off the closing words of Section 6 of the present law and
                provides that the road and poll tax may be worked out under rules prescribed by the
                Road Superintendent. Much work just commenced all over the State would be cut off by
                a repeal of the law as proposed by the bill recommended by the majority of the
                Committee. The law of two years ago as yet had no practical effect. </p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN and Mr. FOULKE thought the point of order is not well taken, as did also
                Messrs, SPANN and VOYLES. </p>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The bill can oe amended by substituting new matter below
                the title and after the bill has passed, then the title could be amended so as to
                conform to the body of the bill. So the point of order is not well taken.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN opposed the minority report, though the complaint is almost universal
                against the existing law. In the poorer Counties it is too expensive. The poorer
                classes should have the right to go upon the road and p'lit; in an honest day's
                work. He could not please the people of his District did he not favor the present
                law. </p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE: Two years ago the Legislature enacted the present law, which has had no
                opportunity to be practically tested The bill proposed by the majority report was
                enacted thirty odd years ago, and the present law was admitted to be a great
                improvement at the time it was passed in the Senate Chamber. The better way is to
                put a sum of money in the hands of a suitable person with which to improve the
                roads. We ought not to change the present system until it is fairly tried. Do not go
                back to She old system till the present law is fully tested. It was always a farce
                to allow a man to pretend to work six or eight hours a day on the public highway. He
                desired to see the majority report adopted. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES: As between the two systems, the old system is preferable. The people
                got used to it, and when a new system was introduced they were dissatisfied. There
                seems to be an almost universal demand for the old law, but if that be re-enacted
                then the minority report should be concurred in. No measure is useful if the people
                are constantly crying out with dissatisfaction against it. If the minority report be
                accepted he should vote for the bill, but as a test vote he should vote for the bill
                of the Senator from Crawford [Mr. Benz]. </p>

              <p>Mr. WHITE said in the northeastern part of the State the present road law is
                considered expensive. They prefer to work out the road tax. If the present law is
                not repealed the roads will become very bad and in an almost impassable condition. </p>

              <p>Mr. HILLIGASS was sure all peoples in his District condemn the present road law.
                There are &lt;3[Uite a number of young men in every County who pay no tax-no polls
                can be collected from them-and under the old law there would have been one or two
                days work collected from that Class. Here are some 1,200 Road Superintendents i in
                the State, and it is proverbial to see a Road i Superintendent riding miles from
                home to find a mud hole to fill up. The present bill takes from the people the right
                to work on the highways, and thousands of dollars are lost by losing the work of the
                class before referred to. There is a demand from the people, after more than a
                year's trial, that the present law be repealed and the old law substituted instead.
                The present law has been tried sufficiently in his District, and the people have had
                enough of it. They demand its repeal and the reinstatement of the old law. </p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY moved to postpone this matter and make it the special order for Tuesday
                next at 2 p. m.</p>

              <p>The motion was agreed to upon a division affirmative, 27; negative, not counted.

                Association act of December 21, 1865, was read the third time.</p>

              <p>Mr. RISTINE: It amends Section 3,431 of the R. S. It was before the Legislature two
                years ago and failed to get beyond the engrossment. This bill requires that the

                offenses land their punishment, of April 14. 1869, was read the third time.</p>

              <p>Mr DUNCAN explained: It simply provides that District School-house doors shall not
                be required to swing out, and also relieves the Trustee of the necessity of changing
                doors so they shall swing out.</p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS thought the bill ought to pass, as the bill has been amended so as
                to apply only to one-story school houses. </p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN hoped the bill will not pass. The country schools ere generally taught in
                winter time, and if fire occurs the little ones all break for the door, and it
                should be made to swing outward.</p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS declared the bill has not , been correctly engrossed, because the
                Committee I attached an amendment limiting its application to one-story buildings, </p>

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM took the blame upon himself, having failed to incorporate the amendment
                in his report. On his motion the engrossment was set aside and the bill was

                    <p>Whereas, One Ruttenhouse, a notorious counterfieiter, has escaped from the

                    <p>Resolved, That the <orgName>Committee on Prisons</orgName> be and are hereby
                      instructed to make full investigation into the escape of these noted
                      criminals, and make full report; thereof to this House, and for all these

              <p>Mr. HEFFREN offered an amendment to the effect that the investigation include all
                pardons granted by our present Governor. </p>

              <p>Mr. DEEM said the man Foxwell named in the resolution was convicted in the Rush
                Circuit Court for the murder of John W. White, a resident of Wabash County, who was
                on his way to visit a relative in Rush County. This red-handed scoundrel did not
                stop in taking the life and robbing the dead body of this noble young man, but by
                the most unparalleled perjury sought to convict an innocent man for his own infamous
                crime. Large rewards were paid for his apprehension and conviction, and he was sent
                to the State Prison South on a life sentence. He escaped after a short imprisonment
                The counterfeiter Ruttenhouse is a noted and most accomplished criminal in his line,
                and was convicted by the Federal authorities after many years of labor and after the
                expenditure of large sums of money. It is asserted that some of the new counterfeit
                now in circulation is the work of his hands and put upon the market since his
                escape. I want the matter of their escape investigated. I do not ask for a, Special
                Committee. The regular Committee can do the work. They expect to visit the Prison
                next week, and no additional expense will be incurred. </p>

              <p>The motion was rejected-yeas, 44; nays, 49. </p>

              <p>Mr. SHIVELY now offered an amendment to the amendment that the investigation be
                extended back to the year 1877. </p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. PATTEN the amendments and the original resolution were laid on the
                table yeas, 48; nays. 40. </p>

              <p>Mr. BRAZELTON offered a resolution, which was adopted, that 200 copies of the bill

            <p> Mr. SPANN, from the Special Committee thereon, returned the resolution allowing
              Captain J. T. Owen $40 for services rendered as Doorkeeper.</p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR stated that Captain Owen was the Janitor two years ago, and I
              told him to attend to the temperature, and spoke to the Doorkeeper about it, but got
              no satisfactory answer. I would rather pay for it out of my own pocket than to have
              the temperature as it was at the beginning of the session two years ago. </p>

            <p>Mr. McINTOSH said the Doorkeeper stated Captain Owen had absolutely done nothing, and
              that already $6 had been voted him. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES moved to amend the report of the Committee by making the amount $15. </p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM did not care whether the Doorkeeper employed this Assistant or not, he
              ought to be paid for services performed. He referred to <pb n="83"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-082"/> the ill ventilation of this chamber at the beginning of
              the session two years ago, and attributed the improvement so far this session to
              Captain Owen's management and experience.</p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE made an ineffectual demand for the previous question. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES insisted, as the Doorkeeper still says Captain Owen has rendered no
              service, and there is no use of making a gratuity to Captain Owen, that his amendment
              be adopted. He has done no service at the instance of the Doorkeeper. If anything has
              been done on his part it is a gratuity. </p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS favored the Committee report because of the retention of Captain Owen
              by ihe President of the Senate. </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and under

              four years, at 8 per cent., readily, and therefore the Committee was not willing to
              recommend a reduction of the interest.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES moved that the bill be recommitted to a Special Committee of Three, with
              instruction to loan the school fund at 6 per cent There is no reason why school fund
              interest should be placed, higher than the legal rate of interest in the State. And
              there are other reasons why school moneys should be loaned as low as other moneys.
              Whether the money is loaned out or not the County has to account to the State for the
              interest on the school fund. Farmers can not <pb n="88" xml:id="VAA8558-21-087"/> pay
              8 per cent. for any considerable length of time. So the best class of borrowers do not
              seek the school funds, but go elsewhere and obtain money cheaper. </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to amend so that the bill may be referred without instructions.
              There is &amp; good deal of reason In the remarks of the Chairman of the
                <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName> [Mr. Johnson. ] Something might be done by
              redistribution of the school fund so that Counties that can loan at 8 percent, can
              have more money apportioned to them. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES accepted the amendment.</p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY opposed the motion. He has a communication from the Auditor of his County
              saying the fund of $54,000 in that County can be loaned at 8 per cent. readily, and
              this is the experience in nearly all the Counties in the State. Where the money is not
              loaned it must be the fault of the officers. In his County the records having been
              burned the County officers can not certify there are no outstanding judgments against
              applicants and consequently they have to procure extra personal security.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE looked at this as a practical business question, and insisted that the
              Legislature should not interfere with the present law. In his County the best class of
              borrowers take all the school money as fast as it is ready to be loaned. The passage
              of this bill would reduce the revenue from interest about $260,000, and consequently
              he spoke in opposition to it.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN insisted the rate of interest on this fund should be uniform all over thus
              State, and that 6 per cent. is high enough. A man must have a remarkable business to
              justify paying more than 6 per cent. In his County a great deal of this money is
              loaned on securities that are not good, and one reason why the rate should be reduced
              is the solvent, debt-paying farmers will not borrow from the school fund while they
              can obtain it cheaper elsewhere. Safety to the fund ana justice to the people demand
              that the rate of interest shall be brought down. </p>

            <p>Mr, VAN VORHIS said if 94 to 96 per cent. of this fund can be loaned at, 8 per cent.
              he opposed anything looking to a reduction of the interest on this fund.</p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE did not think a proper determination would be arrived at without finding,
              out the exact status of the fund ia the various Counties of the State. He would not
              favor reducing the rate of interest to 6 per cent. if more can be realized. He
              supposed the greater part ia loaned on good security. If necessary, the school fund
              should be reapportioned. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES-insisted the rate is too high for borrowers in the Southern part of the
              State. If the rate was reduced men would not go to the banks for money when obtainable
              from the school fund. Men who pay the money back will go for money where it can be had
              the cheapest. Loan agents want to deal with men who will pay not only the money back,
              but the money with interest, and such agents desire to see the interest on the school
              funds kept up at a high rate. </p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS: If the income from the school fund is reduced the number of days of
              schooling must necessarily be reduced, unless teachers be hired at a less salary. </p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY could not see why the school fund Interest should be reduced to 6 per cent.
              when private parties can loan at 8 per cent. It would be a very foolish and unwise
              movement to reduce the rate of interest on the school fund at this time. </p>

            <p>Mr. WHITE opposed the move to reduce the rate of interest. We ought to be very
              careful About this Common School interest-one of the most important in the State. </p>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON said: Within a short time letters have been addressed to the Auditors of
              the ninety-two Counties of the State, seventy-four of which have replied, and out of
              seventy-four forty County Auditors respond that they can loan the school fund at 8 per
              cent., nine for 7, and the balance recommend a reduction to 6 per cent. So it is clear
              that any reduction of the rate of interest would be considered a blow at free schools.
              Only about 4 1/2 per cent. of the entire fund is not loaned out. These figures were
              obtained recently through correspondence by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
              Before consenting to any reduction the Senate should carefully consider the matter. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. WILLARD the motion to refer was laid on the table by yeas, 23; nays,
              13.</p>

            <p>And then the Senate adjourned. </p>

                    be burned or lost; threfore </p>

                  <p>Be it Resolved by the House of Representatives, That the <orgName>Committee on
                      Military Affairs</orgName> confer with the Adjutant General and frame a bill
                    to provide for the recording and safe keeping of said muster-in and master-out
                    rolls and report the same to this House on or before the first day of February,
                    1883.</p>
                </div>
              </body>
            </floatingText>

            <p> Mr. COPELAND moved to amend the resolution by appropriately inserting the
              following:</p>

            <p>Whereas, The names of many members of the Indiana Legion have been, by accident or
              oversight, omitted from the pay-rolls, and have never received any compensation for
              their valuable services in repelling the Morgan and Kirby Smith raids. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT explained that inasmuch as the outlay that it would occasion would be
              considerable, he could not favor the resolution until some investigation could be
              made, and therefore moved that the resolution be referred to the <orgName>Committee on
                Military Affairs</orgName>.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Kosciusko, said: I have been at the Adjutant General's office, and
              find that there are no muster-in and muster-out rolls of several regiments. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH thought the muster rolls should be preserved, but was not in favor of any
              special bill that would occasion a large outlay of money in the end.</p>

            <p>Mr. COPELAND said; I hope the resolution will be unanimously adopted. The papers
              containing the records of our soldiery should be sacredly <pb n="89"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-088"/> preserved. The members of the Indiana Legion whose names
              have been omitted from the pay-roll accidentally or intentionally, should have a
              practical recognition. In our part of The State during the time that hell-hound and
              traitor, John Morgan, was raiding and pillaging our towns and villages, and the
              Knights of the Golden Circle and the Sons of Liberty were plotting treason and
              secretly aiding Morgan and Kirby Smith, our citizens, regardless of party, joined the
              Indiana Legion to protect our people. I believe they will be remunerated in a
              substantial manner by this House. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN (interrupting): May I ask the gentleman from Jefferson a question?</p>

            <p>Mr. COPELAND: Certainly.</p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN: Can you tell me whether or not John Overmeyer was a member of the Sons
              of Liberty at that time? </p>

            <p>Mr. COPELAND; I take pleasure in answering the gentleman I heard one other gentleman
              make that fool charge [cries of "order," "order."]. He was not then or ac any other
              time a member of the vile Knights of the Golden Circle.</p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN: I am sorry that the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Copeland] should make a
              partisan fight on this measure or allude to parties. The gentleman from Jefferson is
              young yet. </p>

            <p>Mr. COPELAND: I was not aware that any one had made or attempted to make a partisan
              allusion in this discussion. If there is any party on this floor that claims or backs
              John Morgan or sympathises with his treason, then I have made an allusion to party. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN thought that as there had been five copies of the muster-out roil made the
              Government had taken all necessary steps to preserve these records. He was not in
              favor of bringing up such questions, as he thought the House had "other fish to fry."
              He thought it was the duty of the Adjutant General to preserve the muster rolls. He
              did not wish to incur any unnecessary expense. </p>

            <p>The motion to refer the resolution to the <orgName>Committee on Military
                Affairs</orgName> was agreed to-yeas, 47; nays, 28. </p>

                <p>Whereas, It has been the recognized right of Government to prohibit or destroy

                  United States; and</p>

                <p> Whereas, The liquor traffic-the foe of God and man-with its long train of crime

                <p> Whereas, The present laws of the State, adopted for the pretended regulations of
                  the sale of intoxicated liquors as a beverage, have failed to protect the

            <head rend="center">EMPLOYES OF THE DOORKEEPER</head>

            <p>Mr. BROWN, from the <orgName>Committee on Executive Appointments</orgName>, returned
              a resolution that all employes not authorized by law be discharged, with a report
              recommending the retention of the twelve attendents employed by the Doorkeeper, as
              they are all needed.</p>

            <p> Mr. DUNCAN, from the same Committee, recommended the discharge of all employes not
              authorized by law. If more is necessary, then there should be a change in the law.</p>

            <p> Mr. DUNCAN: At the time the resolution was offered for the appointment of the extra
              five Doorkeepers there was an impression among new members that the law governing
              these appointments was enacted long ago, whea not so many were needed; but at the
              close of a hundred days' session of the last General Assembly, there was a law passed
              authorizing the Doorkeeper to employ but seven assistants; and if it was necessary to
              have more than seven, Senators must then have understood it. As long as the law stands
              as it does, he should oppose the appointment of a single attendant more than is
              allowed by law. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN contended that the Senate may direct more attendants than the law
              allows.</p>

            <p> Mr. McINTOSH possibly has been caught in a trap in offering this resolution, but he
              found in the statute the number of assistants the Doorkeeper was authorized to appoint
              and their duties. He did not know where these employes are. In the House where there
              are 100 members, they have but seven, the number authorized by law under the
              Doorkeeper, while we have twelve-the Doorkeeper himself making thirteen. They are not
              all necessary and it is an imposition and an outrage on the taxpayers. There are at
              least forty employes in the Senate, as he understood.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN favored the majority report, believing these employes are all needed. He
              moved to lay the report and resolution on the table.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas, 31; nays, 14. </p>

            <p>Mr. YANCEY offered a resolution complimentary to the officials of the Benevolent
              Institutions cf the State. and declaring that they be continued in office until the
              meeting of the next General Assembly. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN objected to its consideration.</p>

            <p>The LIEUTENENT GOVERNOR: It will lie on the table. </p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS.</head>

            <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order being the majority and minority
              reports from the <orgName>Committee on Executive Appointments</orgName>, submitted on
              Saturday.</p>

            <p> The question being on concurring in the minority report recommending that the Senate
              consent to and confirm the appointments of the Governor for Superintendent and
              Trustees for the Benevolent Institutions of the State forthwith-</p>

            <p> Mr. FOULKE believed these appointments should be confirmed at once, every one being
              competent and fit persons for the positions named. There is no objection on personal
              grounds, but only that time may be given for the consideration of a bill proposing to
              take these appointments from the Governor. As a politician, as soon as it shown these
              appointments are to be made, not so much for fitness as the means to further partisan
              ends, the worse it will be for the Democratic party. Appointees of legislative
              caucuses are rewarded for party labor, while more competent persons are more likely to
              come by executive appointments. If incompetent persons are recommended by the Governor
              let them not be confirmed.</p>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY could not understand the object of postponing the confirmation of these
              appointments. It has not even been insinuated that these men are not competent for the
              positions to which they have been appointed. If the Senate is to wait for partisan
              legislation to be enacted we are not discharging our duties under the law, nor acting
              as common courtesy would indicate to the Governor. </p>

            <p> Here a Committee from the House of Representatives await their presence for a Joint
              Convention in pursuance of concurrent action of the two bodies of the General
              Assembly. Thereupon, on motion, Senators left their chamber in charge of the
                <orgName>Committee of Escort</orgName>.</p>

            <p>The following described bills were introduced, read the first time and severally
              referred to appropriate Committees unless otherwise stated:</p>

            <p> By Mr. WHITE [S. 163] concerning County Teachers' Institutes where an average
              attendance of twenty five an allowance of $35; where an average of forty teachers,
              drawing a warrant for $50; an average of fifty-five, the warrant shall be drawn for
              $100 for the purpose of defraying the expense of said institute. </p>

            <p> By Mr. BUNDY [S. 164] to amend Section 457 of the act concerning proceedings in
              civil cases, being 586 of the Revised Statutes of 1881. </p>

            <p> By Mr. SPANN [S. 165] concerning attorneys employed as counsel in the several
              Counties of the State. It provides that attorneys who are employed by Boards of County
              Commissioners to give counsel and are employed by said Boards shall not be employed or
              accept employment from any litigant who may have any business before said Boards. It
              is intended to stop the practice of attorneys taking fees from the County
              Commissioners and from litigants at the same time.</p>

            <p> By Mr. GRAHAM [S.166] to prescribe causes for removal from office of County
              officers. One hundred and fifty copies ordered printed.</p>

            <p>[The bill provides that if any County officer shall demand or receive any fee to
              which he is not entitled by law he may be proceeded against by any citizen, on
              complaint filed in the Circuit Court, and if the complaint be found to be true the
              officer shall be removed and a successor appointed by the Board of Commissioners.] </p>


            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS.</head>

              <p>The Senate returned to the consideration of the subject pending at the time of
                Senators leaving the chamber for the Joint Convention.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY thought the minority report should be adopted. These political questions
                should be disposed of as early in the session as possible.</p>

              <p> Mr. BELL asked if one of these appointees was one of those persons who went and
                helped to count out by fraud a President duly elected to be the Chief Magistracy of
                the United States.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY answered, no. He was glad to know that it is the purpose of the
                Democrats to postpone these nominations until the law is changed, so that the
                Democrats can get themselves together upon a proposition that will change the mode
                of appointing these officers. If that be the purpose, why not take up Senate bill
                No. 1 and dispose of it? If that legislation is important, and above everything
                else, let it be disposed of without further delay. It has been conceded b; Democrats
                in this General Assembly that the present law of appointments is a proper one, and
                in their opinion no new places should be made for party applicants. It is worse than
                tossing up a penny for a choice to have places filled by action of the General
                Assembly. It is in the power of the Democratic side to defeat the nomination of an
                improper person. He hoped the present incumbents would be allowed to retain their
                places, and not be upturning the management of these Institutions every two years. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN understood that Senators on the other side divided on this quesiton. One
                of the Governor's nominees was what is called a visiting statesman of whom it can be
                said there is no more honorable man in the State of Indiana. If that gentleman went
                to the South it was in the interest of a free ballot and a fair count. The
                Presidential Electoral Commission was a Democratic measure, and could have been
                defeated by Democratic votes. No objection can be raised to the confirmation of
                these nominees but a partisan one. The helpless, unfortunate inmates of these
                Benevolent Institutions reach out to some twenty thousand families in this State,
                and yet the Democratic party propose to make them the shuttle-cock in politics. What
                single man in all these lists of appointments but has a character above suspicion,
                and who is pure-hearted and capable? He spoke in favor of concurrence in the
                minority report. </p>

              <p> Mr. BELL: The question before the Senate is, shall these appointments be postponed
                till the 30th of January? For several reasons it should be postponed. We ought to
                know what legislation will be had in reference to this matter, and whether there
                will be any necessity for filling these places in this way or not, before any
                definite acton is taken. He favored the majority report.</p>

              <p> Mr. GRAHAM understood there is a purpose of undoing what was done by a Democratic
                Legislature four years ago. There Is no honest reason why these appointments should
                not be instantly confirmed by the Senate. What is the objection raised by the
                Senator from Allen, Mr Bell? Simply that one of these nominees was what is called a
                visiting statesman. He supported the report of the minority of the
                  <orgName>Committee on Executive Appointments</orgName>.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN would not be betrayed into the dis<pb n="93" xml:id="VAA8558-21-092"
                />cussion of questions entirely foreign to the one before the Senate, which is
                whether it is better to confirm the Governor's appointments now or wait until the
                30th of January. He reviewed his bill [S. 1] for the better management of the
                Benevolent Institutions. It is a Democratic maxim that the servants of the people
                should be chosen by the people, or by the people's representatives, and not
                appointed by a single man who happens to occupy the Gubernatorial chair. The term of
                the present incumbents does not expire till 1 the 1st of February, and if the Senate
                should choose to confirm them, it will be ample time to do so on the 30th of
                January. The proposition that the General Assembly shall select these officials has
                been the plan since 1855 and until the past two General Assemblies. The door of the
                Lower House should not, be shot to a participation in the election of these
                officers. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE contended that it was the duty of Senators not to act as politicians,
                but to act for the best interests of the State of Indiana; and yet no reason has
                been given for the postponement of action upon the Governor's appointments, except
                the desire of Senators on the other side of the Chamber to act upon a bill for the
                reorganization of the Benevolent Institutions of the State. The Democratic party in
                he last campaign posed as an advocate of civil service reform, and yet, at the
                opening of this session, on the first day, immediately after the organization of the
                Senate, and before the Senate was called for bills, a bill was introduced by the
                Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown] to take away the appointing power from the Governor
                and make these officer nothing more nor less than the spoils of a political parry
                and the rewards for political preferment. Is that the kind of civil service reform
                which the Democratic party announced to the people of Indiana in its late platform?
                If there be one thing above all others which should be kept pure-even as the
                Judicial ermine-is the State's exercise of guardianship over her wards; and in doing
                that there is only one thing we have a right to consider, and that is in what way
                may the best appointments of such Trustees be secured. He favored concurrence in the
                report of the minority of the Committee. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES opposed the confirmation of the Governor's appointees, because it would
                make a revolution in the management of the Benevolent Institutions of the State and
                because the appointees are such strict partisans. The management is entitled to
                credit, and the friends of the present management should be retained so as to
                continue to reflect credit upon the State and upon themselves. </p>

              <p>Mr. MAY did not think but there is a question of politics in this matter. The
                Senator from Rush [Mr. Spann] discussed many questions of a political character. And
                the line of argument was elaborated by the Senator from Hamilton, [Mr. Graham] who
                gave Governor Porter taffy because he saw him in front of this Assembly [laughter]
                and then went over and shook hands with him as much as to say, "See what I have done
                for you." [Renewed laughter.] The line of argument used by Senators has had nothing
                to do with the question before the Senate. The time has come fur the reappointment
                of the Trustees and Superintendent ot these institutions, and the Governor sends the
                names of Republicans, thus throwing the political Issue in, and showing that it is
                the intention to change the management of these institutions. If the Governor had
                sent the names of those who have been managing those institutions so well. as he
                acknowledged in his message to the General Assembly, the question would not have
                taken the phase it has He thought this matter has been sufficiently discussed, and
                he demanded the previous question.</p>

              <p>The demand for the previous question was seconded by the Senate, and under <unclear

                  <p>Whereas, There is a great complaint on account of the unjust and ruinous
                    competition arising from the contract system in vogue in our State Prisons, by
                    which not only free competition in the awards of contract of Prison labor is
                    destroyed, but worse than this, and far more ruinous, the labor of prisoners,
                    fed, clothed, and housed by the State, is put on the market at an average of
                    fifty-three and one half (53 1/2) cents per day of nine and one-third (9 1/3)
                    hours average for the year, thus throwing the manufactured products of this
                    slave paid labor, associated with the best machinery and skilled management, on
                    the market to ruinously compete with the manufacturers by free labor,
                    self-clothed, self-fed, and self-housed laborers who are taxpayers, faithful to
                    all the obligations of citizenship, guilty of no misdemeanor unless it be, in
                    that they are the heads and members of families whose fortunes it is to eat
                    bread honestly earned in the sweat of their brow; and, </p>

                  <p>Whereas, This is an opportune time to commence the investigation which must
                    lead to Prison labor reform; therefore</p>

                  <p> Resolved, That we instruct our <orgName>Committee on Prisons</orgName> to
                    carefully investigate this matter in its various phases and ramifications, and
                    report to the House at an early day the result of such investigation, in order
                    that this House may promptly and intelligently apply the remedy to this crying
                    evil. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, said: Mr. Speaker, I desire to say a few words on this
              resolution, and I begin by quoting an expression of the resolution, "this is an
              opportune time" to consider this question. To day we elect the Directors of both
              Prisons, and before they enter upon the duties of their office we make the move in a
              new departure. One not only new, but radical in its purpose. We have no reflection as
              to the outgoing officers or anything to offer by way of reprehension. They may have
              worked faithfully the policy they were elected to carry out. The Committee will at an
              early day, give us the reports as to whether the contracts have been let in a free and
              impartial manner and as to whether, under cover of legal forms, they have violated
                the<unclear reason="faded">[?]</unclear> truth and made free competition a farce. We
              are not here today to arraign the past (till the Committee report), but to work and
              act for the future. We are here to lift our voice up in the interest of free labor
              against the slave labor of our Prison system; to call for the complete deliverance of
              the State from a system that strikes down the laborer, whose only crime is to <unclear
                reason="faded">[?]</unclear> obedient to the <unclear reason="faded">[?]</unclear>
              of fortune, he "eats his honestly-earned bread in the sweat of his lace." That strikes
              down the system that <unclear reason="faded/missing">[?]</unclear> it reaches out its
              hand to aid <unclear reason="faded/missing">[?]</unclear> yet, in the face of all the
              lessons <pb n="94" xml:id="VAA8558-21-093"/> of the past, we are perpetuating this
              system simply ringing the changes on the charges for manufactures made by convicts and
              thrown on the market by the State, and manufactures made by convicts and thrown on the
              market organized by monopolies: still it is the same when unwashed-competition of
              slave with free labor. It is not enough that under one form within the past ten years
              certain industries of a sister State were ruined, and that now under the other from
              every quarter the cry from oppressed labor comes up to the council halls of the Nation
              and almost every State. This is not the time to outline a plan of Prison labor reform.
              After the Committee is made it might be time to act intelligently and promptly. But,
              Mr. Speaker, we deem it entirely proper to say that in any event we shall at no
              distant day lay before the House a scheme that will be both radical and corrective.
              Till then we have said all that it is wise and prudent to say.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILSON, of Marion, moved an amendment to instruct the <orgName>Committee on
                Prisons</orgName> to prepare a bill, and report the same to the House, to provide
              for the relief of free labor from competing with convict labor, and to provide for
              some way to make convict labor self-supporting.</p>

            <p> Mr. JEWETT said: I had thought before I came here that some steps should be taken in
              this direction, and if there is nothing in the resolution which reflects upon the
              present Prison managers I shall heartily support it. It seems to me that there is
              something wrong in allowing Prison labor to be brought into competition with free
              labor. I have my opinion, which is that convict labor could, and ought to be used in
              maintaining the highways of Indiana. It seems to me possible for the <orgName>Prison
                Committee</orgName> to devise some means of using this convict labor on the public
              highways, and as I said before, it after the resolution is read again, if it is as
              fair and honest as it seems to me to be, it is one that ought to receive the hearty
              support of every member on this floor.</p>

            <p> Mr. SHOCKNEY said our present convict labor is self-supporting and has been for some
              time. We have a great number of men in our Penitentiaries and they must be employed in
              some way. I think that as Legislators we should look to the interest of the State and
              not to the interest of individuals.</p>

            <p> Mr. SHIVELEY was in favor of any bill that would protect free labor from the odium
              cast upon it by coming into competition with convict labor.</p>

            <p> Mr. GIBSON did not favor the resolution, and stated that while the persons, who
              employ this convict labor made more money on their product than other manufacturers
              they did not place the products of this convict labor upon the market at reduced
              prices, or at prices lower than other manufacturers. He thought it was not practicable
              to employ this convict labor in constructing and maintaining our highways as had been
              suggested by the gentleman from Scott [Mr. Jewett]. The expense of guarding these men
              while work and building jails to confine them in would make such a thing
              impracticable.</p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, accepted the amendment [Mr. Wilson's]. </p>

            <p> The resolution as amended was adopted by yeas, 83; nays, 9.</p>

            <p> Mr. SHOCKNEY offered a resolution authorizing the <orgName>Committee on
                Prisons</orgName> to prepare a bill and present it to this House, fixing the maximum
              and minimum price at which convict labor may be employed.</p>

            <p> Mr. GIBSON moved to lay the resolution on the table. This motion was agreed to. </p>

            <p>Mr. KESTER from the <orgName>Committee on Agriculture</orgName>, reported back Mr.
              Bower's bill [H. R. 60] concerning sheep-killing dogs, with the recommendation that
              the bill be indefinitely postponed.</p>

            <p> The report was concurred in.</p>

            <head rend="center">LAWFUL FENCES </head>

            <p> Also, Mr. Patten's [H R 166] concerning legal enclosures, with the recommendation
              that the bill be indefinitely postponed. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN said: I want to say this in behalf of my bill: Personally I have very
              little interest in a bill of this nature for I usually keep good fences myself, but I
              have been requested by many farmers to introduce a bill of this kind. As the law now
              stands we have no standard of a legal fence-we have no legal fence in the State of
              Indiana. This bill simply provides for and defines what a legal fence shall be. I
              think it a necessity that we have some legal definition in regard to what constitutes
              a fence in the State of Indiana. This subject has caused a great deal of litigation in
              this State and has cost our people a great deal of money. A great part of this expense
              might be saved to our people by making our statutes provide for a legal fence.</p>

            <p> Pending the consideration of this report-</p>

            <p> Mr. WILSON, of Marion, moved that a Committee of two be appointed to inform the
              Senate that the House is now ready to go into the election of a State Librarian, two
              Directors of the Prison South and three Directors of the Prison North. </p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to, and in a few minutes thereafter the Senate, conducted by
              the House Committee appeared, and took seats on the floor of the House. </p>

            <p> The House returned to the consideration of the report from the committee on
              Agriculture on Mr Patten's bill [H. R. 165] interrupted by the Joint Convention. </p>

            <p>Mr. KESTER said, in justice to the Committee, lie desired to state that they had no
              111 feeling against the gentleman from Sullivan (Mr. Patten) or his bill. We simply
              acted upon the bill and maae a miammous report.</p>

            <p>Mr. MONTGOMERY was not in favor of killing the bill so abruptly, and therefore moved
              to recommit it to the <orgName>Committee on County and Township
              Business</orgName>.</p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY spoke in favor of recommitting the bill. He thought the bill in some
              respects was an improvement on the present statute on the subject, and while he would
              not argue in favor of the bill, he would speak in favor of what was good in it. He
              thought there should be some legislation on this subject. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN thought some of the provisions of the bill were not good. He did not
              consider a four and a half foot fence a good substantial fence in case a pack of mules
              or a drove of steers were running at large He thought It would be discourtesy to take
              it from the <orgName>Committee on Agriculture</orgName> and end it to some other
              Committee. He therefore moved to recommit it to the <orgName>Committee on

              appointment of Supervisor of highways. [See p. 28 and 78 of the Brevier Reports.]</p>

            <p>The majority report recommend amendment of the bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_006"
                >S. 6</ref>] by making the tax in Section 3 not less than five cents nor more than
              forty cents on the $100. The minority report entirely new matter as a substitute for
              the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY offered a substitute for both the majority and minority reports-being new
              matter from and after the enacting clause. He said there is nothing of so much
              importance to the farming community as the road law. The present law gives
              dissatisfaction and there is a demand for a new system for the repair n improvement of
              roads. The substituted provisions of tho measure now proposed as a substitute are: It
              does away with the Road Superintendent and with the Road Master: it makes the Trustee
              ex-officio Road Superintendent of all highways in his Township, who shall divide his
              Township into road districts not less than six square miles in area, in each of which
              there is to be elected a Road Supervisor who has charge of the work on the road, under
              the direction of the Township Trustee, citizens to work out the poll tax similar to
              the (. Id law for, working out road tax. The Township Trustee shall have control of
              all the roads so there may be a system of roads. The property tax shall be paid to the
              Township Trustee to be expended under his direction. </p>

            <p>Mr VOYLES, interrupting, suggested that this bill be printed and the subject
              postponed till after the printing. </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL seconded the motion to print. </p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM thought the explanation of the author would be better than printing the
              bill.</p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY (continuing): The Road Supervisors should expend this road money under the
              direction of the Township Trustee. The bill permits every taxpayer to work his road
              tax out, if it is done as cheap as other labor is performed. It makes the Supervisor
              an officer, requires bond, and subjects him to removal by the Township Trustee for
              cause. He did not claim this bill as a perfect one but insisted it contains the better
              provisions of the present and the old law.</p>

            <head rend="center">THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.</head>

            <p>Mr. SPANN called up the special order, being the resolution offered by Mr. Van Vorhis
              on the 12th inst., [see pp. 49, 50 and 76 of the Brevier Reports] instructing the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> to report if any amendment or amendments to
              the Constitution of this State were proposed by the last General Assembly and referred
              to this; with a majority report of said Committee, signed by five members, declaring
              there is nothing on the journals to show that either the House of Representatives or
              the Senate of the last General Assembly referred or intended to refer any proposition
              to amend the Constitution of this General Assembly.</p>

            <p> The minority report, signed by two members, states: We do not find that said
              resolutions were spread at length upon the journals of the General Assembly, nor that
              they were, in words, referred to this General Assembly. We do find that they are in
              the same condition as resolutions heretofore adopted and agreed to as amendments to
              the Constitution of Indiana, which were agreed to by a succeeding majority of the
              electors of the State of Indiana, and declared by the Governor of the State to have
              been duly adopted as a part of the Constitution of Indiana. We, therefore, find and
              report to the Senate that the provisions of Section 1, Article 16, of the Constitution
              of Indiana have been substantially complied with, and that said several joint
              resolutions above set forth are duly and legally before this General Assembly for its
              action thereon.</p>

            <p> The question being on concurrence in the minority report-</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. BROWN, the Senate resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName> (Mr. Henry in the Chair) for the consideration of these reports.</p>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY moved that the Committee recommend that the Senate concur in the minority
              report of the Committee. </p>

            <p> Mr. BELL moved that the Committee recommend the Senate concur in the majority
              report.</p>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY did not propose to discuss all the questions that arise on this subject,
              but to give a few reasons why the report of the minority of the <orgName>Judiciary
                Committee</orgName> should be concurred in. He conceded if the words, "entered on
              the journals," as used in the Constitution, mean "spread at length", then so much of
              the requirement of the Constitution was omitted. Nor were words entered on the
              journals referring such amendments to this General Assembly. The controversy arises
              whether this renders it possible for this General Assembly to pass upon these
              amendments. All Governments are founded upon the surrender of some natural rights, and
              no presumption should arise as to the intention to use the words of the Constitution
              in the strictest sense. In some cases the language of the Constitution must be
              literally construed without conflicting with the wishes of a majority of the people.
              It is said Constitutional provisions should stand exactly as written, but in nearly
              every State Courts have been and are now constructing Constitutions as are thought
              best to carry out the spirit of the instrument. It is the intent of the law that it is
              to be inferred, and what better manner is there to find this out than by the
              expressions and views stated by the law makers at the time of the enactment of the
              law? In the Constitutional debates not one word is recorded about spreading proposed
              Constitutional amendments on the journals of each House, and it is fair to presume it
              was considered as a mere matter of form. He read a lengthy argument, and in support of
              his position read from numerous judicial decisions.</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. BROWN, the Committee took a recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION</head>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON said: Mr. President-To obey and support the Constitution of Indiana as it
              stands to-day is what every Senator upon taking his oath has sworn to do. The
              Constitution is an instrument of such momentous importance that every one of its
              provisions should be followed and obeyed to the letter and that no room for any other
              construction except its literal demands should be entertained. In no ease is this.
              however, more necessary than when an attempt is being made to amend the great
              instrument which protects the rights of every man, woman and child in this State, and,
              as in the case of the so-called prohibitory liquor amendment, to introduce into the
              Constitution a provision which will, to a large degree annul and invalidate both the
              Constitutional and natural rights of citizens, In such case I claim more than usual
              caution and a strictly literal compliance with every demand and direction of the
              Constitution should be exercised.</p>

            <p>It seems to me that party polities have nothing whatever to do with the question. I
              am well aware that the Republican party has made the adoption of the prohibitory
              amendment a party question, and it is pretty generally understood, and some of their
              ablest representatives in the press freely admit that in doing so, in placing itself
              upon a prohibitory platform, the Republican party has made a fatal mistake, a mistake
              which has in the November election cost them several great States, upon which the
              Republicans seemed to hold a life-long lien, and which, if they pursue in their
              course, will unquestionably cost them the Presidency. It is true, too, that the
              Democratic party, at least a great majority of the Democratic party, is opposed to the
              prohibitory amendment, but in doing so, the Democratic party has merely reasserted the
              fundamental principle underlying our system of government, the great principle that
              there are rights, inherent in human nature, sacred natural rights which on State and
              no political majority has any right or power to deprive them of. However, disregarding
              these Constitutional and natural rights of every citizen of this State, the Republican
              majority of the last General Assembly adopted a prohibitory amendment, which, for the
              second stage of its consideration, and in its regular course of Constitutional action,
              had to be referred to the present General Assembly. This reference to the present
              General Assembly could only be made according to certain regulations and rules, laid
              down in and prescribed by the Constitution itself. Article 16, of the Constitution,
              prescribing the mode of procedure in the case of amendments, says: "If the same shall
              be agreed to by a majority of the members elected to each of the two Houses, such
              proposed amendment or amendments shall, with the yeas and nays thereon, be entered on
              their journals, and referred to the General Assembly to be chosen at the next general
              election." Now, Mr. President, it seems to me the language of the Constitution is very
              clear on the subject, and can not possibly be misunderstood by any one who is willing
              and unprejudiced enough to interpret it literally. The Constitution demands that the
              amendment, that is to say the full text of the amendment, adopted by the Legislature,
              be entered at length-and every word of it-on the journals of each House. The
              Constitution demands it, I say, for the words "shall, with the yeas and nays thereon,
              be entered on their journals." in my opinion can not have any other meaning. In a
              question of such vital importance as a Constitutional amendment, the General Assembly,
              to which this amendment was to be referred for action thereon, was not to be left in
                <pb n="99" xml:id="VAA8558-21-098"/> uncertainty as to what that amendment really
              was, and so that there could be no possible misunderstanding of what that amendment
              provided for in the mind of any Senator or Representative, the full text of the
              amendment was to be em bodied in the journals of each House. </p>

            <p>Now let us see what has been done and In what manner the provision of the
              Constitution has been complied with. I have only had an opportunity to consult the
              Senate Journal, but on turning to the index I find that the final action on the House
              joint resolution No 7. which is the prohibitory amendment, is recorded on pages 828
              and 829, and in what in what manner? [Reads ] Not one word designating that joint
              resolution as the prohibitory amendment, much less the full text and the language of
              the amendment itself! Now, Mr. President, I ask, in all candor, the gentlemen of the
              legal fraternity on this floor whether, in legal or legislative language, what has
              been done this case is correctly expressed by the word "entered?" Is it not true that
              there are three different words expressing, so to say, a gradation of one and the same
              action, but each used only in a separate stage of such action? Is it not true that
              resolutions may be filed, noted or entered, and that to file a resolution merely
              conveys the idea that a certain paper has been deposited at the proper place, and that
              that act is recognized by an indorsement on the back of the instrument? Is it not true
              that a resolution is noted, when it is marked down in an official record, journal or
              book, merely by reference to its number or title-but that the legislative expression
              entered is always used when the full text and language of a resolution are recorded
              and spread at length in an official journal, and that the expression "entered" is used
              in no other sense. It seems to me that this is this is conclusive proof of what the
              Sixteenth Article of the Constitution wanted done in case an amendment was to be
              referred to the next General Assembly. It wanted the amendment entered on the journals
              of both Houses, and consequently it wanted the full text, the full language of the
              amendment cited in the pages of the journals, and it did not require the amendment
              merely noted, as has been done in this case. Mr. President, this amendment is of too
              serious, too grave, and too far-reaching a character to be treated lightly and
              superficially. All amendments are the organic law of the land has been and must be
              surrounded by bulwarks and entrenchments, which ought to be so strong and so difficult
              of access that not a mere assault and surprise, but only a protracted and patient
              siege, can overcome and conquer them. The framers of our Constitution have in then
              wisdom reared those bulwarks and intrenchmems by laying down the Constitutional rules
              for amending it. The very words of these rules should be religiously observed, and not
              an iota should be tempted in going through a slow and tedious process of an amendment.
              It is this very difficulty and slowness which constitute our security and guarantee
              the perpetuity of our liberty and freedom-both as a Nation and as individuals.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, Mr. President, I would say that I entirely disagree with the senator
              form Henry [Mr. Bundy], when he says that in this case it would be desirable if every
              Senator on this floor were a lawyer. If the language of the Constitution with
              reference to these amendments were clothed in complicated and technical phraseology;
              if to the ordinary reader or Legislator that language presented difficulties not
              readily to overcome then. It might be desirable to have this question decided only by
              a tribunal of lawyers, But this is not the case; the provisions of the Constitution
              are laid down in plain English, and I do not believe that there is one Senator on this
              floor or one Representative on the floor of the House who is not fully competent to
              decide the matter for himself. But even admitting, for the sake of argument, that the
              wish of the Senator from Henry might be justified, to have this question decided
              solely and exclusively by attorneys the learned expounders of Constitutional law, is
              he not even then beaten by the force of his own argument? Has not the Senate been
              informed by a majority of the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, that is
              to say, by a very decided majority of the learned attorneys whom the Senate has
              selected as its interpreters of he law and the Constitution, that these amendments
              have rot been properiy referred to the present General Assembly and that they are not
              to be considered as pending? Mr. President, on account of the various reasons adduced
              by me, and because I feel conscious that the Constitutional] provisions have not, been
              complied with in regard to the amendment said to be pending, I am in favor of adopting
              the majority report of the Committee, and opposed to adopting the minority report.</p>

            <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: For this Legislature to Fay the proposed Constitutional amendments
              are Constitutionally before this General Assembly would be committing an error
              indefensible. The only right the Legislature has to take steps like this is a right
              given by the Constitution itself, and before taking such step, the Legislature must
              find authority therefor in that organic instrument. In plain language, the
              Constitution requires that the proposed amendment itself must be put upon the
              journals-there must be some identification of its language upon the journals. Taking
              it for granted, these proposed amendments were not entered upon the journals of the
              last General Assembly, he proceeded to call attention to some other provisions of the
              Constitution. By virtue of the Constitution it is provided that proposed amendments
              shall be set forth in the journals of the General Assembly, and the laws of the State
              provide that those journals shall be circulate in every County in the State. It does
              not take any great Constitutional lawyer to understand this plain requirement of the
              Constitution, and so every citizen can search those journals and see if the proposed
              amendments are set forth in those journals, and if one word is different in one
              journal from the other then the Legislature has no business to consider the amendment
              in which such difference in words as set forth in the two journals may be found. It is
              a question of their publication-in order that the people may be prepared to pass upon
              such question-so stated by the framers of the Constitution-that the people may know an
              amendment has been proposed to the organic law-not through newspapers, but in a
              Constitutional way; by publication in the journals of the two Houses of the General
              Assembly. He thought there was no very grave Constitutional question involved in this
              matter. It is as clear as the noonday sun that the Constitutional provision in regard
              to these proposed amendments has not been complied with. The only conclusive evidence
              as to whether these proposed amendments were agreed to by the last General Assembly is
              pointed out in the Constitution itself, which provides that they must be spread upon
              the journals of the two Houses. Members of the Legislature took an oath to support the
              Constitution of the State, and not to support any proposed amendments, and where there
              is a question or a doubt as to whether or not there is a Constitutional amendment
              before this General Assemble, the safest thing to do is to give the Constitution the
              benefit of the doubt and say the plain, simple provisions of the Constitution must be
              complied with before members should vote to adopt any such proposed amendments. He was
              anxious to see the report of the majority of the Committee sustained </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE sincerely believed, as a lawyer, that the proposed constitutional
              amendments are ' now before this General Assembly for its consid<pb n="100"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-099"/>eration and action. It is true we are acting in the opacity
              of Judges, but let it not be forgotten that the most conscientious of all English
              jurists [Sir Matthew Hale] has said that it is the province of a wise Judge to extend
              his jurisdiction, lest there be a failure of justice. If the balance be anywhere near
              equal, upon one side or the other, we should remember that, and especially in this
              case, lest the voice of the people remain stifled. There is no doubt, the Constitution
              can be amended only in the manner prescribed by itself; but he contended the
              requirements have been substantially complied with. He held it to be unnecessary that
              proposed constitutional Amendments should be spread at large upon the journals of the
              two Houses for the reasons laid down by Governor Bake. In a message to the General
              Assembly, and concurred in by that General Assembly, in the passage of the Wabash and
              Erie Canal amendment to the Constitution. He regarded the clause as not mandatory, and
              even should it be considered mandatory it has been substantially complied with. He
              went so far as to hold that if it be commanded by the Constitution that proposed
              Constitutional amendments should be spread at length upon the journal, that provision
              in merely directory and not mandatory-we are not bound by it. These amendments are
              properly before us provided we have it properly authenticated, in any other form or
              manner, that they were agreed to by the last General Assembly. After leading from many
              authorities lay to whether the word "shall" in the Constitution is to be regarded as
              mandatory, he said: in view of this uncontradicted mass of authority we may safely lay
              down the proposition that the word "shall" in the Constitution is not always
              imperative and mandatory. The word "shall" is no more mandatory in the Constitution
              than in the Statutes, and the same rules apply to it in the one case as in the other.
              He regarded it as conclusively settled that whatever relates to The mode of procedure
              merely, a ad is not of the essence of the thing to be done, is to be enforced by the
              oaths of members only, and by no other power whatever, in discussing other modes of
              authentication provided in the Constitution, he insisted that, even should pages be
              torn from the Journals and be thrown in a waste basket, they could be supplied,
              because it should not be left in the power of one man to deprive the people of the
              State of their rights; neither should that happen because clerks fail to do their
              duty. The Senate Journal has been read but once since the beginning of this session.

            <p> Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, offered a joint resolution [H. R. 17] proposing an amendment
              to Section 6, Article 7, of the Constitution of the State. </p>

            <p>Also, a joint resolution [H. R.] to amend Section 5 of Article 7 of the Constitution
              of the State. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT thought these resolutions were out of order. A provision of the
              Constitution declaring that when an amendment has been acted upon by a preceding
              General Assembly, and is awaiting the action of a succeeding one, no other amendment
              to the Constitution can be proposed for the ratification or rejection of the voters of
              the State. He, therefore, moved to reject them. </p>

            <p>Mr SMITH, of Tippecanoe, moved to refer the resolution to the <orgName>Committee on
                the Judiciary</orgName>.</p>

            <p>Mr. WRIGHT insisted the House should decide this question without any trouble. Every
              member who believes the Constitutional amendments pending should vote for the
              rejection of the resolutions. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN explained that if there are no amendments pending before the House at the
              present time passed by the last General Assembly and referred to this General
              Assembly, then the gentleman's resolutions are in order. If, however, the amendments
              passed by the last General Assembly are now pending before this General Assembly, then
              the gentleman's resolutions are not in order [Mr. Heffren here read the sections of
              the Constitution which provide for its own amendment] He asked that the gentleman from
              Knox (Mr. Williams) would withdraw his resolutions for the present, as he did not want
              the members of this House to be caught in a trap. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, said: My purpose is to secure if I can such amendment to the
              Constitution as will result in keeping out of the Indiana Reports all cases that have
              no public or general interest. As the law now stand's the reporter prints each and
              every case decided by the Supreme Court, and as a result, in the last two years ten
              Indiana Reports have been published. The Reports sell at S3 50 each, a good thing for
              the official reporter, but a heavy and unnecessary draft upon the people. I have given
              considerable time to an investigation of this matter, and I am satisfied that the
              Bench and Bar of this State are a unit in demanding relief. Each lawyer in the State
              who keeps up the Reports Is doing so at an expense of $1750 per year, and the State
              for Reports for the use of its officers pays $9,625 per year 'Thu is too much. Bills
              are pending here to reduce the price per volume, but the best way to get relief is to
              reduce the number. The <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> is now investigating the
              question, and I hoped that these resolutions would go to that Committe. I have no
              fears about the Constitutional objection sought to be raised. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH stated that so far as he knew and so far as the House knew there are
              amendments pending before this House at the present time, but if this House decides
              that there are no amendments now pending then any amendment or amendments may be
              proposed. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT said: My object in moving to reject, I very candidly confess, is to take
              the sense of this House whether or not these amendments are before this House. I am as
              well satisfied as to the condition of these amendments as if I had heard every member
              express themselves. Those who believe that the amendments are now pending are
              compelled to vote against these resolutions- I </p>

            <p>Mr. GORDON moved to postpone further consideration of this subject until Friday 2

              decisions of the Supreme Court of Iowa upon the question of Constitution amendments,

              <head rend="center">RELOCATION OF COUNTY SEATS. </head>

              <p>Mr. BRAZELTON'S [H R. 91] concerning the relocation of county seats. </p>

              <p>Mr HEFFREN moved to recommit this hill to the <orgName>Committee on County and
                  Township Business</orgName>.</p>

              <p>Mr BRAZELTON said: I hope, sir, that the motion will not prevail. I think that the
                  <orgName>Committee on County and Township Business</orgName> carefully considered
                this bill before submitting its report. As to-the merits of the bill I am prepared,
                I think, to say that it is an honest and fair bill. It is a bill adapted to all the
                Counties of the State. It provides that 65 per cent. of The voters of the County
                shall vote for the relocation. Now take the County where I live, with 4 000 voters,
                it would require 2,600 of the voters to relocate the County Seat, and I think that
                if two-thirds of the voters in a County desire to change the County seat of the
                County they ought to be allowed to do so. Now I trust, gentlemen of the House, that
                the bill will not be recommitted. </p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT considered the only question before the House to be the one to recommit.
                He thought the Committee was a good one and believed that the members of the
                Committee had given this bill sufficient consideration before they submitted the
                same to the House. He felt that the Committee had done its duty. He thought that the
                bill should be engrossed, and when it came up for final passage the merits of the
                bill could be discussed.</p>

              <p>Mr. HEFFRFEN spoke in favor of his motion to recommit. He was in under the
                impression that the bill had been formed for the relocation of the County seat of
                one County, and that in the consideration of the bill the Committee had only heard
                one side of the question. He was informed that there were persons present who
                desired to go before the Committee and represent the other side of the matter. He
                considered these sufficient reasons to recommit the bill, </p>

              <p>Pending the consideration of the motion to recommit-</p>

              <p>The House adjourned until 10 a. m. January 25. </p>

              <head rend="center">SUBMISSION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.</head>

              <p> Mr. WILLARD introduced the following bill [S. 156] see page 86.</p>

              <p>A BILL for an act providing for the submission to the electors of the Stale of
                Indiana for ratification or rejection f any Constitutional amendment or amendments
                which may at any time be pro- posed and agreed to by two General Assemblies in
                succession, in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the Constitution of
                the State of Indiana, prescribing certain duties of officers of election and other,
                providing penalties for violation thereof, repealing all laws in conflict therewith,
                and declaring an emergency.</p>

              <p>Whereas, We are in favor of the submission of all proposed Constitutional
                amendments to the people according to the provisions of the Constitution for its own
                amendment, and the people have the right to oppose or favor the adoption of any or
                bill amendments at any or all stages of their consideration and any submission of
                Constitutional amendments to a vote of the people should be at a time and under
                circumstances most favorable to a full vote, and, therefore, should be at a general
                election. Therefore, </p>

              <p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana that
                whenever any amendment or amendments to the Constitution of the State of Indiana
                shall have been proposed and agreed to by two successive General Assemblies, in
                accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the Constitution of the State of
                Indiana, the same shall be submitted to the electors of the State for their
                ratification or rejection at the general election next succeeding, at which
                Representatives in the General Assembly shall be elected. </p>

              <p>Sec. 2. The Secretary of State shall on the first Tuesday in October, immediately
                preceding said general election, cause to be prepared ballots, on each of which
                shall be printed the proposed amendment or amendments, numbered severally, and below
                any proposed amendment shall be printed the word "yes" in one line and in another
                line the word "no." He shall on said first Tuesday in October send to the sheriff of
                each County a number of said ballots, not less than three times the number of votes
                cast in said County at the last general election: and the Sheriff shall, Immediately
                after receiving said ballots, deliver to the Trustees of each Township in his County
                a number of said ballots not less than double the number of votes cast at said
                election in said Township. It shall be the duty of each Trustee to see that a number
                of said ballots, not less than double the number of votes cast at said election in
                each Precinct in his Township, be in the hands of the Inspector thereof at the
                opening of the polls. The Inspector shall, on request, deliver to each elector at
                the time of the election one of said ballots. The Secretary of State shall also
                procure and furnish on said first Tuesday in October, as other election papers are
                furnished, the blanks for the poll-lists; tally sheets and certificates required by
                this act. </p>

              <p>Sec, 3 Any qualified elector may vote at such election, for or against any or all
                proposed amendments, by depositing one of said ballots in the ballot-box. If he in-
                tends to vote for any amendment he shall leave under the same the word "yes" and
                erase the word "no" by drawing a line across it or otherwise. If he intends to vote
                against any amendment he shall leave under the same the word "no" and erase the word
                "yes," and the votes cast shall be counted accordingly. I', 'under any proposed
                amendment or amendments as printed on <pb n="103" xml:id="VAA8558-21-102"/> said
                ballots, the words "yes" and "no" shall both remain without erasure, or both be
                erased, then such ballot shall not be counted as a vote either for or against that
                amendment under which said words so remain, but no elector shall vote more than once
                at such an election.</p>

              <p> Sec. 4. The laws of this State governing gen-elections as to the organization,
                powers and duties of election Boards, and the return and canvassing of votes, shall
                be observed by the several Boards of Election in making return and canvass of the
                votes cast at the election herein provided for, so far as they may be applicable,
                modified, however, as to the contents and return of certificates to correspond with
                the requirements of this act.</p>

              <p> Sec. 5. The Board of Election of each Precinct shall count the votes for and
                against each proposed amendment separately, and also the whole number of electors
                who voted at the election, and certify all said numbers, specifying separately the
                number of votes cast for any proposed amendment, and the number cast against any,
                and the whole number of electors who voted at the election, over their signatures or
                the signatures of a majority of them to the Clerk of the Circuit Court in their
                County within two days after the election. The Clerk of each County shall, within
                four days after said election, ascertain from such certificates the total vote in
                his County for and against each proposed amendment separately, and also the whole
                number of electors who voted at the election and certify the same to the Secretary
                of State. The Secretary of State shall, as soon as possible after the election,
                determine from said certificates of the Clerks of the several Counties the total
                vote cast in the State for and against any proposed amendment separately and also
                the total number of electors who voted at the election, and certify the same to the
                Governor; and the Governor shall immediately issue and publish his proclamation
                declaring therein the number of votes cast in the State for and against any proposed
                amendment separately, and also the whole number of electors who voted at the
                election. And if it shall appear that the number of votes cast in the State for any
                one or more of proposed amendments was greater than the number of votes cast against
                the same amendment, and equal to the majority of all the electors who voted at the
                election then each such amendment shall be deemed and taken to have been ratified by
                the electors of the State, and become part of the Constitution, and shall be so
                declared by the Governor in his proclamation. But if it shall appear that any
                proposed amendment has received in its favor a number of votes less than a majority
                of all the electors who voted at the election, then each such amendment shall be
                deemed and taken to have been rejected by the electors of the State, and shall be so
                declared by the Governor in his proclamation. For the purpose of the ratification or
                rejection of any proposed amendment or amendments the number of electors who shall
                vote at the election herein provided for shall be conclusively taken and deemed to
                be the whole number of electors in the State. The certificate of the Secretary of
                State, herein provided for, and the proclamation of the Governor, based thereon,
                shall be final and conclusive evidence of the number of votes cast for and against
                each amendment, and of the whole number of electors who voted at the election, and
                of the ratification or rejection of each proposed amendment, as the case may be. In
                all proceedings had under this act any proposed amendment may be designated by
                number, except in the ballots.</p>

              <p>Sec. 6. Nothing in this act contained shall be construed to require the use of the
                ballots provided for in this act, to the exclusion of other written or printed
                ballots, and all ballots cast shall be counted and returned in accordance with the
                intention manifested on the face thereof.</p>

              <p>Sec. 7. Any officer whose duty it is, under this act, to make or sign any return or
                certificate of the number of votes cast for or against any proposed amendment or
                amendments or of the number of electors who voted at the election, who shall
                knowingly make or sign any false return or certificate of any such number, and any
                officer violating any of the provisions of this act, or failing to discharge any
                duty by this act imposed on him, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction
                thereof, shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $1,000, to which may be added
                imprisonment in the County Jail for any period not exceeding six months.</p>

              <p> Sec. 8. If any elector shall cast, or personally offer, or attempt to cast more
                than one ballot at such election, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on
                conviction thereof he shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $500, to which may be
                added imprisonment in the County Jail not exceeding six months. If any person shall
                vote, or offer to vote, on any amendment or amendments without being a qualified
                elector in the Precinct in which he so votes or offers to vote, he shall be liable
                to all the pains and penalties provided by law for the like offense at a general
                election.</p>

              <p> Sec. 9. It shall be the duty of the Governor, on the first Tuesday in September
                immediately preceeding such general election, to issue a proclamation notifying the
                electors of the State of the election therein provided for. It shall be the duty of
                the Secretary of State to cause said proclamation and this act to be printed for the
                purposes of following, and transmit to the Sheriff of each County, with the ballots
                and blanks herein before provided for, a sufficient number of such printed copies to
                enable such Sheriff to deliver four of the same to each Clerk, four to each Auditor,
                one to each Township Trustee for himself and one for each Inspector of Election in
                his Township, other than himself, which it shall be the duty of such Sheriff to do.
                It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to send the printed copies of this
                act, and the Governor's proclamation, and the ballots, poll-list, tally sheets and
                certificates which he is by this act required to send to the Sheriffs of the several
                Counties, by express to all Counties, with the County seat, of which there is
                communication in that manner from Indianapolis, and to the Sheriffs of other

            <p> Mr. BROWN moved to amend the bill by adding an additional section, providing for the
              removal of officers for cause, the Governor to fill the vacancy until the next meeting
              of the Legislature, and that the General Assembly shall elect the first incumbents
              immediately on the taking effect of this act. He said this section is taken from what
              is known as the Wilson bill [H. R. 42]</p>

            <p> These amendments were agreed to by yeas, 27; nays, 20.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN moved to amend by inserting a section requiring the Female Department of
              the Insane Asylum to be placed in charge of a competent female physician. He insisted
              that there should be this recognition given to the women of the State.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN opposed the amendment, as that question will properly come up for decision
              before the Trustees of that institution, and if they think it advisable, a female
              physician will be selected by them. He demanded the previous question.</p>

            <p> The demand was seconded by yeas, 26; nays, 28; and under the operation of the

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order for this hour-11 o'clock-being
              the consideration of the proposed Constitutional<pb n="106" xml:id="VAA8558-21-105"/>
              amendment resolution, and the majority and minority reports from the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> thereon, in the Committees of the Whole, and
              thereupon he gave place to the Chairman, Mr. Henry, who stated the question to be on
              the motion pending at the adjournment yesterday to concur in the majority report. </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE (continuing his speech, begun yesterday afternoon) regretted the
              consumption of so large an amount of time in his argument of this question, but it is
              to be presumed that members of the Senate are trying so to do their duty, and their
              duty is to decide this case according to the Constitution and the law. No party
              pledges were made in consideration of this defect, the amendments not being found in
              the Legislative journals, and the question whether or not this General Assembly is to
              consider the amendments was not sprung. A large number of this body not being members
              of the legal profession, it seems right to present fully the legal aspect of this
              case. He insisted wherever the means of identification are complied with that is all
              the law requires. The requirement that the amendment be entered on the records in
              directory only and not imperative. But even if imperative it has been sufficiently
              complied with. It has been said that two of the resolutions passed by the last General
              Assembly are concurrent and not joint resolutions. The title says they are joint
              resolutions, but the style indicates they are concurrent. In the Brevier Reports an
              examination showed [he had not examined the journals] that the same course was taken
              with them as with bills. They were read three times and passed by a yea and nay vote.
              And so it would seem they can properly be construed as Joint resolutions. If they are
              concurrent resolutions they are not properly before us, but if from the mode of
              procedure they can be considered as joint resolutions they have been properly
              authenticated and they properly before us. If in our duty to submit these amendments
              to the people They are before us and we have no right to stifle the popular voice upon
              a mere technical plea. He tried to discuss the question as free as possible from all
              political bias, and was extremely glad to find his convictions on the legal aspect of
              the case agreed with his convictions as a man. It is presumed all will try to pass
              upon this question as free as possible from party affiliations. If gentlemen on the
              other side feel themselves bound by the dictates of party let them remember a course
              that shall stifle the voice of the people unless it is imperatively demanded by the
              Constitution, will read upon the persons and the party attempting it.</p>

            <p>We are acting as a Court in this matter-a Court of exclusive jurisdiction-and a
              decision has heretofore been rendered in a precisely similar case. He bad gone over
              the record of proceedings in the Wabash and Erie Canal amendment question pretty fully
              and found that the amendment was referred to the <orgName>Judiciary
                Committee</orgName>, of which the present Senator from Jackson (Mr. Brown) was a
              member. The <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> reported favorably on the amendment
              and the General Assembly adopted it with a knowledge on the part of every member just
              what the law was. But the Senator from Jackson said the other day it was adopted
              without considering this point. That could hardly be excusable, after Governor Baker
              had called attention, to it in his message to that body. But the record shows the
              point was considered in the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, considered on the
              floor of the Senate and considered by the Senator from Jackson [Reread some remarks
              made by that Senator as printed in volume XIII. of the Brevier Legislative Reports, p.
              52.] So Senator from Jackson would indicate that if the original resolutions were
              dragged from the Secretary, of State's office and brought here, that would satisfy the
              necessary conditions of identification. The question is which Senator from. Jackson
              shall we follow the Senator from Jackson in regard to the Wabash and Erie Canal or the
              Senator from Jackson in regard to these Constitutional amendments? </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN (interposing): The Senator from Jackson was a very young man when he was a
              Senator on the Wabash and Erie canal. [Laughter ] And another infirmity the Senator
              from Jackson then suffered was that he was outside of the Democratic camp, and just
              then was among you fellows. [Renewed laughter.] </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE continued his remarks but a few moments longer. When he had concluded.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN the Committee rose, reported progress and asked leave to sit
              again at 2 o'clock.</p>

            <p>The report was concurred in by the Senate. </p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR called the Senate to order. The hour having arrived for the
              Senate to resume its sitting as in a <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>, he
              vacated the chair and requested the Chairman [Mr. Henry] to preside.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES had thought of expressing his views on the merits and demerits of the
              proposed amendment, but as the main point in this discussion has been made a legal
              one, he would detain the Senate but a short time in referring to the conclusions of
              the majority and minority reports under consideration. There is much unnecessary
              detail in the minority report. It will not be supposed anything is proved because much
              is said. The field of citing authorities has been well scanned. He regretted this
              legal obstacle stood in the way, because there is something always in a legal
              proposition that appeals so strongly to a lawyer that he can not resist its influence.
              But the legal obstacle stands in the way of a clear and fair presentation of the
              question concerning those amendments. </p>

            <p>The Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke] took a perilous route in his argument,
              endeavoring to divide Constitutional essentials and Constitutional non-essentials, and
              then subdividing the essentials and non-essentials, making a distinction too fine for
              a man of limited comprehension. There can be no reason for this attempted distinction.
              It doesn't address itself to the common sense or common right to undertake to go <pb
                n="107" xml:id="VAA8558-21-106"/> behind the plain letter of the Constitution, and
              where there has been an unpardonable omission on the part of the preceding General
              Assembly for a succeeding one to take it up and say; "It is a great party necessity or
              emergency; we are responsible, therefore we will take the risk. It is true the
              Constitution has not been complied with," but the necessities are very great, and we
              will goon as if the Constitution had been complied with." If the General Assembly two
              years ago desired to refer these amendments to this General Assembly, there must have
              been a proposition from same source by some member on the floor of the House or the
              Senate by which it would have been pro- posed to refer the amendments which had been
              agreed to to this General Assembly. But that was not done. It is admitted on all sides
              the was not done. So, as far as the records are concerned, we have none to go by-we
              have no record what- ever. </p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL said he was no lawyer, had no experience or ability to range the wide
              fields gleaned so fully and so ably by the lawyers from both sides; that he could only
              decide this question by the rule of practical common sense and by precedents, which he
              knew to exist in our own State and by the decisions to which others had called his
              attention. He was surprised to note the independence with which Senators had so often
              on this floor proclaimed themselves uninfluenced by others, and that they considered
              they need no advice and should in no way be governed by what others may do or have
              done. As for himself, he confessed that in his boyhood's days and first flush of
              manhood he had possibly felt some of that independence and strength which needed no
              advice and would brook none, but he had long since passed that age, and found that in
              all walks of life and in all that he had to do, he almost invariably was glad to go
              for advice to some precedent or some authority that he regarded as worthy to lean
              upon, and that he had never regarded it as reflecting upon his manhood to thus seek
              advice, and so in the validity of this question, in the opinion of Governor Baker,
              given after a careful examination, saying that he had no doubts as to the legality of
              the Wabash and Erie Canal amendments in the exact condition that these are, and added
              to this that the Assembly, after having their attention called to the the condition of
              the record, had concurred in the amendments with but one dissenting voice, and
              Governor Hendricks had approved them, declaring them duly passed and a part of the
              Constitution, without suggesting a question of doubt All found a precedent
              satisfactory to him, and gave him confidence to follow without hesitation or any
              feeling of having lost his dignity or his independence of manhood. He felt this all
              the more because the canal amendments were of vital importance, protecting in their
              scope millions of the State's money, and as there was no emergency calling for undue
              haste, he felt that the Governors and the Assembly setting the precedent had
              established a very formidable one, and one that he did not hesitate to follow. He
              occupied the floor about fifteen minutes, referring briefly to several points that had
              been made, and to the importance of the question under discussion.</p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN gave a history of the state of affairs prior to the consideration of the
              Wabash and Erie Canal amendment, and conceded Governor Baker then took the ground that
              the portion of the Constitution requiring the amendments thereto entered upon the
              journals of the two Houses was advisory. He repeated what he said the other day: To at
              the question was not raised or considered in the Legislature twelve years ago. What
              had been read this morning by the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Foulke) from the Brevier
              Legislative Reports, Volume xiii, as remarks of his on that occasion is entirely true,
              and it is also true, as there recorded. ' that he then charged upon the Republican
              party dereliction of duty. He said then, and would make no appology for it now, that
              there was in existence a joint resolution which was authenticated by the signatures of
              the presiding officers of the preceding body. The decision of the Supreme Court
              referred to on the floor bad just been published, and he then relied upon that
              decision because there was no discussion and no controversy in the Legislature about
              that question, for everybody desired this amendment to go into the Constitution, to
              prevent the possibility of any Legislature assuming this debt created by the bills of
              1846-47. When he said twelve years ago mat the signatures thereto authenticated
              thereto resolution, he made one of those grevious mistakes and grievous blunders that
              a boy of his age might have made, and he is not ashamed. When he has made a mistake,
              to stand before the Senate and the country and acknowledge it Mr. B. then proceeded to
              discuss the question before the Committee, declaring it to be the meaning of the
              Constitution that every word, line and syllable of every proposed amendment thereto
              shall be placed upon the journals of each House of the General Assembly, referring
              such amendments o the succeeding one; and until that is done no action can be taken by
              the succeeding General Assembly. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN replied to Mr. Brown's speech, insisting there is no Senator on that side
              who can answer the legal arguments made on this question by the Senator from Henry
              [Mr. Bundy], and the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke] This question has been made a
              political one on this floor by the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Johnson], who said the
              Republican party forced this measure in politics. The question of prohibition never
              would have been before the people in the last campaign had it not beau for the vote of
              the Senator from Jackson and five other Democrats on this floor. He continued for some
              time, recounting the course of the Democratic party in the last canvass, and concluded
              by asserting his strong belief as a lawyer and Senator, that the only question now
              before the Senate is one of jurisdiction, and being a jurisdictional question as far
              as the proposed amendments are concerned, it is a Court of the last resort. When
              Courts of Record are determining a question of jurisdiction upon the record the Court
              will always give the benefit of the doubt to the record. He took the equitable side of
              this question, and equity takes him him over on the side of the people. He never will
              allow his vote on a technical question to override the will of the people of Indiana.
              When he had concluded-</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. BELL the Committee rose, reported progress and asked leave to sit
              again to-morrow at 10:30 o'clock.</p>

            <p>The report was concurred in by the Senate. </p>

          <p> The session was opened with prayer by Elder David Walk, pastor of the Central
            Christian Church of this city. </p>

          <p>The SPEAKER directed a call of the House, which, being taken, discovered ninety-five
            members as present and answering to their names. </p>

          <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY made an ineffective motion to dispense with the reading of the Clerk's
            minutes of yesterday's proceedings. </p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">RELOCATION OF COUNTY SEATS.</head>

            <p> The SPEAKER announced the first thing in order to be the consideration of the
              subject pending at the adjournment yesterday, being Mr. Brazelton's bill [H. R. 91] to
              provide for the relocation of County seats, the question being on the motion to
              recommit it to the <orgName>Committee on County and Township Business</orgName>.</p>

            <pb n="108" xml:id="VAA8558-21-107"/>

            <p> Mr. BRAZELTON said: It was stated or insinuated by the gentleman from Marion (Mr.
              Wilson) on yesterday, that the mover of this bill appeared before the Committee when
              the same was considered. I confess that I did, as I had a right to do, and every
              member of this Committee will bear me out in saying that I did not in any manner
              urgently insist or antagonize their action in the least. I take it that this motion to
              recommit is simply a dilatory measure only. The gentleman from Marion said that the
              bill repealed certain law, and I answered that the bill does, but I understand that
              that law was enacted for the County which I have the honor to represent. As the law
              now stands, if every man, woman and child in the County desired to change the location
              of the County seat, they could not do it. Under the present provisions it would be
              removed three miles out into the woods. He continued at some length in opposition to
              the motion to recommit. </p>

            <p> Mr. ADAMS stated that he would not have said anything on this question had h not
              been called out by the remarks made by certain members yesterday while discussing the
              subject. He thought that if it was a fair and honest bill gentlemen ought not to
              object to its going back to the Committee, so that persons might appear before the
              Committee who represented the opposition to the bill. He said the bill was introduced
              on the 10th day of January, and on the 15th of January it was reported back from the
              Committee. I am told by gentlemen that before they knew that the bill was before the
              House it had come back from the Committee. I say that it is but fair and equitable
              that these men should be allowed to go before this Committee and present their side of
              the question.</p>

            <p> Mr. MOODY desired to know who should decide a question of relocation if 65 per cent.
              of the inhabitants of a County can not. This Committee has had the bill under
              consideration once, and it had better lie on the table than be recommitted. The House
              ought to act upon it now.</p>

            <p> Mr. JEWETT spoke in opposition to the motion to recommit. </p>

            <p> Mr. GORDON spoke in opposition to the bill and favored the motion to recommit. </p>

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN favored his motion to recommit. There is no provision in the bill to
              contest a selection should one be carried by fraud.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILSON also favored the motion to recommit.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, spoke in favor of recommittal and against the passage of the
              bill.</p>

            <p> The motion to recommit was rejected by yeas, <unclear reason="faded">[?]</unclear>8;
              nays, 61.</p>

            <p> The bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading.</p>

            <p> Then came a recess for dinner. </p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT moved that the order of the day be now taken up, the same being the
              several reports from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> as to whether or not
              the Constitutional Amendments are properly pending before the present General
              Assembly, and that the reports be referred to a <orgName>Committee of the Whole
                House</orgName>.</p>

            <p> It was so ordered and accordingly the House resolved itself into a
                <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>, Mr. Jewett being called to the chair.</p>

            <p> The several reports were then read.</p>

            <p> Mr. McMULLEN moved that the <orgName>Committee of the Whole House</orgName> concur
              in the majority report signed by Messrs. Williams, of Knox, Heffren, Wilson of Marion,
              and McMullen.</p>

            <p> Mr. PATTEN moved to amend by substituting the minority report signed by Messrs.
              Jewett and Patten.</p>

            <p> Mr. FRAZER moved an amendment to the amendment by substituting the report signed by
              Messrs. Adams, Stewart, Wiley, Wright and Frazer. </p>

            <p> Mr. PATTEN said: I do not feel physically able to attempt to discuss this question
              to-day. I can neither do myself nor the question justice. Therefore, I will have to be
              excused from attempting any argument of this question. I felt that I am in the right
              on this matter, and I suppose that the gentlemen on the other side of this question
              fell that they likewise are in the right. All that I can do is to present this matter
              for discussion. I have acted under the best dictation of my conscience, and if I am
              wrong my report ought not to prevail, and if I am right then it ought to prevail. I
              have tried to be governed by the proper mind and feeling in this matter. I believe
              from what little I have examined into the question that the Constitution has been
              complied with in every step. I believe this and I have so entered my conclusion in our
              report. To decide whether or not these amendments have been properly referred is not
              in the province of any Committee. That is a question for this House exclusively. I am
              in favor of submitting this to the House and taking a fair and square vote upon it.
              Let the members of this House say whether or not these amendments are pending, and
              there is no Court in the world to repeal their decision.</p>

            <p> Mr. FRAZER: Of the numerous questions which suggest themselves in the investigation
              of this question, nearly all can be readily settled by argument and without debate. It
              will be conceded by all-</p>

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN said:</p>

            <p> Mr. SPEAKER-In proceeding to discuss the question as to whether the Constitutional
              amendment, known as the prohibition amendment, is properly before this General
              Assembly, or I perhaps should say whether any such amendment <pb n="109"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-108"/> was properly passed by the Fifty-second General Assembly
              in accordance with the forms and directions of the Constitution, I shall not do so as
              a partisan or as an attorney. I, with the other members of this House, each took an
              oath to support the Constitution of Indiana, and I propose to do so to the best of my
              knowledge. This question may, in a certain sense, be and is partisan, but I shall
              direct my attention to the legal phase of this subject in this discussion. We are now,
              I believe, sitting as judges under the solemn sanction of an oath, and ought and I
              believe will decide as judges upon this question of law, for it is purely one of law
              and nothing else. My first impression was when I read that the proposed amendment had
              not been entered upon the journal of either this House or Senate, that it was perhaps
              a trick. A few days since I, in company with another member of this House, gave the
              subject the best examination we could, and I confers I became satisfied ^hat it was no
              trick. </p>

            <p>I will first call the attention of the House to Section 12, of Article 4, of the
              Constitution of Indiana. It is as follows: </p>

            <p>"Section 12. Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and publish the
              same. The yeas and nays, on any question, shall, at the request of any two members, be
              entered together with the number of the members demanding the same, on the journal;
              Provided, That on motion to adjourn, it shall require one-tenth or the members present
              to order the yeas and nays." </p>



            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">THUS WE SEE </head>

              <p>that upon resolutions, motions, references and all other matters that come before
                this House, although required to keep a journal, the yeas and nays were not entered
                thereon, together with the names of members, "unless two members demand it. We find
                by Section 18, Article 4, of our Constitution the following:</p>

              <p> "Section 18. Every bill shall be read by sections on three several days in each
                House, unless, in case of emergency two-thirds of the House where such bill may be
                depending shall; by a vote of yeas and nays, deem it expedient to dispense with this
                rule; but the reading of the bill by sections, on its final passage, shall in no
                case be dispensed with, and the vote on the passage of every bill and joint
                resolution shall betaken by yeas and nays."</p>

              <p>Neither this section nor the one first quoted requires the yeas and nays to be
                "entered" on the journal except demanded by two members. A vote on the passage of a
                bill by yeas and nays need not necessarily be placed upon the journal. There is
                nothing mandatory or directory requiring their entry upon the journal except at the
                "demand of two members," when they shall be so entered. It need not be done, so far
                as the Constitution is concerned, at all upon the passage of any bill or other
                matter. You may ask why. By the common law the presiding officer is presumed to know
                several things in connection with the business pertaining to the House over which he
                presides He is a sworn officer, and the law sup poses that every officer will do his
                duty. It is therefore presumed that he would allow no business transacted unless a
                quorum was present to act. It is presumed that he knows whether a resolution or
                motion has been adopted or rejected. It is also presumed that </p>

            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">UPON THE THIRD READING OF A BILL</head>

              <p> which puts it on its passage, that in this House fifty-one members have voted for
                it. Yet the names of members to verify this fact may not be entered upon the journal
                unless demanded by two members." It is presumed that the presiding officer will not
                sign a bill as having passed, unless all the requirements of the Constitution have
                been complied with. When he signs a bill the law presumes all the necessary and
                proper steps in the House over which he presides to have been legally taken.</p>

              <p>But suppose that in an action at law between John Doe and Richard Roe<unclear
                  reason="faded">[?]</unclear> one sets up that the law under which the plaintiff
                claims was not properly passed. To what then do we resort? This is the troublesome
                question, with Judges and lawyers. It is one, however, in which the authorities are
                largely on one side. Before proceeding to discuss this question let us see what the
                Constitution provides in regard to its own amendment. It is contained in a single
                article of two sections. It reads as follows: </p>
            </div>
            <!-- end section -->

            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">ARTICLE XVI.</head>
              <head rend="center">AMENDMENTS</head>

              <p> Section 1. Any amendment or amendments to this Constitution may be proposed in
                either branch of the General Assembly; and if the same shall be agreed to by a
                majority of the members elected to each of the two Houses, such proposed amendment
                or amendments shall, with the yeas and nays thereon, be entered on their journals
                and referred to the General Assembly to be chosen at the next general election; and,
                if in the General Assembly so next chosen, such proposed amendment or amendments
                shall be agreed to by a majority of all members elected to each House, then it shall
                be the duty of the General Assembly to submit such amendment or amendments to the
                electors of the State, and if a majority of said electors shall ratify the same,
                such amendment or amendments shall become a part of the Constitution.</p>

              <p> Sec. 2. If two or more amendments shall be submitted at the same time, they shall
                be submitted in such manner that the electors shall vote for or against each of such
                amendments separately; and while such an amendment or amendments which shall have
                been agreed upon by one General Assembly shall be awaiting the action of a succeding
                General Assembly, or of the electors, no additional amendment or amendments shall be
                proposed.</p>

              <p> No one will contend but that the first section is mandatory. It is a command to
                the General Assembly: "And if the same shall be agreed to by a majority of the
                members elected to each of the two Houses, such proposed amendment or amendments
                shall (a direct command), with the yeas and nays thereon, be entered on their
                journals and referred to the General Assembly to be chosen at the next general
                election." Both the House and Senate journals are mere blanks, so far as the
                amendments proposed is concerned, nor is there any reference of such proposed
                amendment to the next General Assembly. But this immediately raises the question of
                allowing the journals of each House to be used as evidence. </p>

                searched to find out the truth, Suppose an act is properly enrolled, duly signed, by
                the Speaker of this House and the President of the Senate and approved by the
                Governor, and filed, as the law directs, in the office of the Secretary of State, we
                all would say that it was the law of the land. But, suppose when the journal of this
                House came to be examined, only fifty members voted for it, as appears by the
                journal, would anyone say that the bill had become a law? Most assuredly not.</p>

              <p>In the recent Iowa case of Kochler and Lang vs. Lee, the Supreme Court of Iowa,
                used the following language upon the proposed amendment to the Constitution of that
                State, and which is identical with our own:</p>

              <p> "The question before us is to the validity of a Constitutional amendment, and we
                think there <pb n="110" xml:id="VAA8558-21-109"/> is a material distinction between
                the rules which must obtain in such case and when a statute is assailed as not
                having been Constitutionally enacted. The Constitution provides for its own
                amendment, and the manner in which this may be done is prescribed with
                particularity, and yet its provisions are simple and readily understood. An
                amendment may be 'proposed in either House of the General Assembly, and, if the same
                shall be agreed to by a majority of the members elected to each of the two Houses,
                the proposed amendment shall be entered on the journals, with the yeas and nays
                taken thereon.'"</p>

              <p>They quote from Cooler's Constitutional Limitations as follows:</p>

              <p>"In all that we have said on this subject we have assumed the Constitutional
                provisions to be mandatory. The fact Is this: That whatever Constitutional provision
                can be looked upon as directory merely is very likely to be treated by the
                Legislature as if it is devoid even of moral obligation, and to be therefore
                habitually disregarded. To say that a provision is directory seems with many persons
                to be equivalent to saying that it is not law at all. That this ought not to be so
                must be conceded. If it is not so we have abundant reason and good authority for
                saying. If, therefore, a Constitutional provision is to be in force at all it must
                be treated as mandatory, and if the Legislature habitually disregards it, it seems
                to us that there is all the more urgent necessity that the Courts should enforce it.
                And it also seems to us that there are few evils which can be inflicted by a strict
                adherence to the law so great as that which is done by the habitual disregard by any
                department of the Government of a plain requirement of that instrument from which it
                deliver authority, which ought, therefore, to be scrupulously observed and obeyed "
                [Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 2 ed. 140 ]</p>

              <p>and to be all of one political party, and that one not of my own kind, they proceed
                as follows:</p>

              <p>"We deem it sufficient to say that if there is any provision of the Constitution
                which should be disregarded as mandatory it is not where the Constitution provides
                for its own amendment otherwise than by means of a Convention called for that
                purpose. The powers of a Convention are of course, limited. The members thereof are
                the representatives of the people, called together for that purpose. The object of
                the provision can not be doubted or misunderstood. It is to preserve in the manner
                indicated the identical amendment proposed and in an authentic form, which, under
                the Constitution, is to come from the succeeding General Assembly. No better mode
                court have been adopted, when it is considered that, to be effective, the proposed
                amend men t must be agreed to by The succeeding General Assembly. This thought; is
                much strengthened by the consideration that the proposed amendment is only required
                to be entered on the journals of th first General Assembly which acts thereon. This
                distinction, to our minds, is significant, and enhances the importance of the
                Constitutional injunction that, the proposed amendment shall be entered on the
                journals of both Houses of the General Assembly which first agrees thereto. </p>

              <p> "It is immaterial, however, whether the Constitution provides the best method for
                the preservation and authenticity of proposed amendments or not, for the
                Constitutional mode must prevail, even if it be conceded some other would have been
                better.</p>

              <p>"It may be suggested that to enter or entering on the journal does not necessarily
                mean spreading the same at length thereon. This will be conceded, but that it may so
                mean must, we think, be conceded. [See Webster's Dictionary.] Various instances
                where the words "to enter or entered" occur in the statutes or the Constitution may
                no doubt be cited where they do not mean spread at length. But this is of much
                insignificance, for the object to be attained must be considered in determining the
                meaning of the word entered as used in the Constitution. The evident intention of
                the Constitution is that the proposed amendment shall be entered at length on the
                journal, or at least be so entered as to leave no reasonable doubt as to its
                provisions. This must be so, or the entering of the yeas and says can be as readily
                dispersed with as entering the resolution, and yet this is the Constitutional mode
                of ascertaining whether a majority of members elected to each House agreed to the
                amendment. [Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 2 ed., 141.1</p>

              <p>"When the object intended to be accomplished is considered, we think there is no
                doubt that it is the design and intent of the Constitution that a proposed amendment
                there should be so entered on the journals that it can be known by an examination of
                the journals precisely what it is that has been agreed on by each House of the
                General Assembly which first acts thereon to the end that the succeeding General
                Assembly may certainly know what its predecessor did. It seems to us that a simple
                entering on the journal of the title or object of a proposed amendment does not
                accomplish the intent of the Constitution, and the thought that this must be so is
                much strengthened when regard is had to all the provisions of the Constitution. That
                instrument provides that upon the final passage of the bill the yeas and nays must
                be taken and the same entered upon the journal. This necessitates the entering on
                the journal of the title page or substance of the bill to be voted n. This being so
                it no more than this was intended in relation to a Constitutional amendment, the
                provision as to entering on the journal is unnecessary and meaningless. There is no
                provision requiring a bill to be entered on the journal, but the Constitution does
                require that a proposed amendment thereto 'shall be entered' on the journals 'with
                the yeas and nays.' This must mean that the amendment shall be spread at length
                thereon, and the yeas and nays set out in the journal in full or at length. No
                distinction between the two can possibly be drawn. Amendments were proposed to the
                Constitution in the Eleventh General Assembly, some of which were agreed to, but all
                were spread at length on the journals. The amendment afterward ratified by the
                electors striking out the word 'white' where it occurred in the Constitution was
                among the amendments proposed at that session. These amendments were spread at
                length upon the journals of both Houses. Here we have a legislative construction of
                the Constitution which should not and can not be ignored. </p>

              <p>"It will be observed that the Constitution does not provide in what manner the
                amendment shall be proposed. Whether it shall be done by a bill or joint resolution
                seems to have been left to the discretion of the General Assembly to determine; but,
                in whatever way proposed, when agreed to this provided it shall be entered on the
                journal " </p>

              <p>It does seem to me that this decision is decisive of the case, and that </p>

              <p> are not now nor can not be before this General Assembly. Some may say that Section
                25 of Article 4, which reads as follows:</p>

              <p>"Sec. 25. A majority of all the members elected to each House shall be necessary to
                pass every bill or joint resolution, and all bills and all joint resolutions so
                passed shall be signed by the presiding officers of the respective Houses."</p>

              <p> Whether this supposed proposed amendment was by joint resolution, by concurrent
                resolution or by a resolution or motion, could <pb n="111" xml:id="VAA8558-21-110"/>
                make no difference. The amendment must "be entered, set out at full length,
                re-recorded upon the journal with the yeas and nays thereon, if a majority of each
                House vote for it, and then the proposed amendment is "referred" to the next General
                Assembly elected at the next general election. The journals must show such a
                reference, or else the whole matter becomes null and void and of no effect in law.
                This was not done by the last General Assembly nor by either House thereof. There is
                no authority given in Article 16 for any entering or signing by the Speaker of the
                House, or President of the Senate, or approval by the Governor, and filing in the
                office of Secretary of State. It must be "entered upon the journals of each House,
                together with the yeas and nays thereon, and then referred to the next General
                Assembly" for action. The next General Assembly looks nowhere but to the journals

              <p>for the proposed amendment. On this point, the Supreme Court of Iowa says: </p>

              <p>"Now suppose a member of either House had, while it was in session, really proposed
                the amendment in question in the form it was agreed to by the electors and it had
                been entered at length on the journal and agreed to, and the amendment so entered
                bad been correctly copied and properly transmitted to the other House, entered at
                length on its journal, and agreed to and published, as provided by the Constitution
                and law, and the subsequent General Assembly had agreed thereto as required by the
                Constitution, and the same submitted to the electors, as was done, could it be said,
                it was not Constitutionally adopted because it was not enrolled, signed by the
                presiding officers of the two Houses, and approved by the Governor? If it can be so
                said, why or for what reason? Suppose the Governor had vetoed the joint resolution
                and returned it with his objections to the House in which it originated, and, upon
                being put on its passage, it had failed to receive a two-thirds majority In one or
                both Houses as provided in Article 3, Section 16, of the Constitution would this
                have been fatal to the amendment? No one will so contend. It was not essential,
                therefore, that the Governor should have approved the joint resolution; nor is there
                a statute which by implication requires that a Joint Resolution proposing to amend
                the Constitution shall be signed by the presiding officers of the two Houses. Such a
                signing therefore is not essential, and may be dispensed with. There is no provision
                of the Constitution or statute which requires it shall be enrolled. But there is a
                Constitutional injunction to say the least that it shall be entered on the journals.
                In a Constitutional sense the journals constitute and are the primary evidence, and
                the enrolling and signing, as above stated, at best are only secondary evidence,
                which may and can only be considered when the primary evidence has been lost or
                destroyed." </p>

              <p>Is not this conclusive of the question? and can any lawyer who sits here as a Judge
                come to any other conclusion ?</p>

              <p>A few words as to the decision of our own Supreme Court in Evans vs. Brown. 30
                Indiana page. That case was in all respects different from this. That question was
                as to the validity of an act passed by the Legislature. It was duly signed by the
                Speaker of the House, President of the Senate, and approved by the Governor, and
                duly filed in the office of the Secretary of State. The journal of the House showed
                a quorum present at the last roll-call before the passage of the act. Forty-two
                members, I believe, resigned in the afternoon and handed their resignations to
                Governor Baker. He did not notify the House unto next day f their resignation; in
                the meantime the bill had been passed. There was nothing to show that a quorum was
                not present when the bill passed, and the presumption of law was in favor of its
                legality. The Court presumed the officers performed their duty irrespective of the
                Constitution. But the </p>

              <p> is against that decision. The dicta of the learned Judge who rendered the opinion
                and for whose sound and discriminating judgment and accurate understaning of the law
                I have long entertained the highest respect, is dangerous and revolutionary.</p>

              <p>I have no doubt, was he to re-examine the case, much that is mere dicta, would be
                omitted. </p>

              <p>No section of the Constitution, no paragraph of the same, requires a bill to be
                "entered on the journals of each House together with the yeas and nays thereon "
                before it shall become a law, and as I have said, the yeas and nays are not
                commanded to be entered upon the journals, only as demanded by two members, save and
                except where the instrument provides for its own amendment. The distinction is
                marked plain between the two.</p>

              <p>I will here cite a few authorities bearing upon the question of the journals being
                used as evidence, and I will again quote fully from the Iowa decision to which I
                have already alluded: </p>

              <p>"A brief examination of some of the authorities may, however, be of advantage when
                we come to consider the beaming of the provisions of the Constitution and the
                statutes of this State on the question under consideration. The leading and better
                reasoned of the cases which hold the enrolled bill was Constitutionally passed by
                the General Assmebly, or the contents of the bill, are: The People vs. Devlin, 33 N.
                Y.; Sherman vs. Story, 30 Cal., 254; Pabord vs. Young, 32 N.J., 29; Pacific Railroad
                Company vs. the Governor, 23 Mo., 353; Evans, Auditor of State, vs. Brown, 30 Ind.,
                514.</p>

              <p> "These cases are based on substantially the same reasons, which are stated in the
                New York case as follows: 'The journals are not made evidence by the Constitution;
                they are not made so by the statutes; they were never made so at common law.'</p>

              <p> "In the New Jersey case it is said: 'They [the journals] are not required to be
                tested in any way whatever. There is required not a single guarantee as to their
                accuracy or truth. No one need vouch for them, and it is not enjoined that they
                should be either approved, copied or recorded.'" </p>

              <p> "In addition to the foregoing counsel for the appellant have cited the State of
                Nevada vs. Swift, 10 Nev., 176; Eld. vs. Gorham 20 Conn., 7; Green vs. Weller, 32
                Miss., 650; Division of Howard County, 15 Kan. 394; Annapolis vs. Howard, 32 Md.,
                471; Clara vs. The State, 5 Iowa, 509; and Duncombe vs. Prindle, 12 lb. 1.</p>

              <p>"All that was determined in relation to the question under consideration in the two
                last named cases was that, where there is a conflict between the printed act or
                statute and the enrolled act filed in the office of the Secretary of State, the
                latter is the ultimate proof of the true expression of the legislative will. Whether
                the journals were competent evidence or their effect was considered in neither case.
                On the other hand, omitting reference to the earlier New York, Missouri and Indiana

              <p> "But courts tread on very dangerous ground when they venture to apply rules which
                distinguish directory and mandatory statutes to the provisions of the Constitution.
                Constitutions do not usually undertake to prescribe mere rules of proceeding, except
                when such rules are looked upon as essential to the thing to be done; and they must
                then be regarded as limitations upon the power to be exercised. It is the province
                of an instrument of this solid and permanent character to establish these
                fundamental maxims and fix those unvarying rules by which all Departments of the
                Government must at all times shape their conduct; and if it descences to prescribing
                mere rules of order in unessential matters, it is lowering the proper dignity of
                such an instrument and usurping the proper province of ordinary legislation. We are
                not, therefore, to expect to find in a Constitution provisions which the people, in
                adopting it, have no regard as of high importance and worthy to be embraced in an
                instrument which for a time, at least, is to control alike the Government and the
                governed, and to form a standard by which is to be measured the power which can be
                exercised as well by the delegates as by the sovereign people themselves. If
                directions are given respecting the times and modes of proceeding in which such a
                power should be exercised, there is at least a strong presumption that the people
                designed it should be exercised in that time and mode only; and we impute to the
                people a want of due appreciation of the purpose and proper province of such an
                instrument, when we infer that such directions are given to any other end,
                especially when, as has already been said, it is but fair to presume that the people
                in their Constitution have expressed themselves in careful and measured terms,
                corresponding with the immense importance of the power delegated, and with a view to
                leave as little as possible to implication." </p>

              <p> of this House, but I will refer to few of the many cases with which our law
                reports abound.</p>

              <p> In People vs. Sterne, 35 Ill., 12, the validity of an act was called in question
                upon the grounds that the journals were wholly silent in regard to the bill; the law
                was held to be a nullity. The Constitution required the proceedings to be entered on
                the journals, and it had not been done.</p>

              <p> In Collier vs. Friesson, 24 Alabama, 108, Goldthwaite, Judge, in speaking for the
                Court said: "We entertain no doubt that to change the Constitution in any other mode
                than by a convention, every requisition which is demanded by the instrument itself
                must be observed, and omission of any one is fatal to the amendment. The
                Constitution is the supreme and paramount law. The mode by which amendments are to
                be made under it is clearly defined. It has been said that certain acts are to be
                done, certain requisitions are to be observed before a change can be effected, but
                to what purpose are these acts required, or their regulations enjoined, if the
                Legislature or any other department oft the Government can dispense with them? To do
                so would violate the instrument which they are sworn to support, and every principle
                of public law and sound Constitutional policy requires hte Court to pronounce
                against every amendment which is shown not to have been made in accordance with the
                rules prescribed by the fundamental law." </p>

              <p> This body must judge for itself whether there are any amendments pro nosed to the
                organic law "awaiting its action," and must therefore resort to that organic law to
                see if its provisions have been obeyed in preparing the proposed amendments. If they
                have not been obeyed, the whole is null and void. The journals must show that the
                same amendment was proposed and voted on in each House of the General Assembly, and
                that said proposed amendment received </p>

              <p>in each House, and that the same identical proposed amendment passed each House by
                a majority of all, and that the same, together with the yeas and nays, were recorded
                upon the journals of both Houses find that they were referred to this General
                Assembly. </p>

              <p>Will some member take the House journal of 1881 and show me the supposed proposed
                amendment? Will he show it to me on the Senate journal? Will he show me where the
                amendment proposed, together with the yeas and nays thereon, was referred to this
                General Assembly? It can not be done. They are not there.</p>

              <p> The words "shall be entered" is a direct and positive command, and is a mandatory
                order that can not be evaded. I care not what other legislators or other
                Legislatures have done, this question was not then raised; this is its first
                appearance, and we must deal with it as the supreme law commands and in no other
                way. One may say that it is directory. If so, whom does it direct? It directs us who
                have sworn before our God to support and obey it. Its direction is a command to our
                hearts, our consciences and to our judgments. We dare not disobey its positive
                instructions or its positive directions. </p>

              <p>I have spoken of this in a legal point of view. It, Is nor for me to discuss in
                this argument the question of prohibition. Other times will do for that. I appeal to
                every member on this floor to lay aside partisan feeling and judge of this matter as
                men who sit upon the Bench deciding questions of law. Let not questions of
                expediency or of policy creep in to distract your mind from the legal question. Rise
                above party utterance and party bigotry, above party policy and party trickery, and
                solve this problem as becomes honest legislators and we shall do but our duty. </p>

              <p>Mr. Speaker, I have expressed my views upon this great question, great in its
                inception, great in its growth and great at its maturity. It is a question which
                arouses passion, incites envy, beget jealousies and rivalries, distracts
                neighborhoods and communities. It is a Pandora's box of evils, and even were it a
                thousand fold worse than it is, and the requirements of the Constitution had been
                followed, I should have <pb n="113" xml:id="VAA8558-21-112"/> hesitated before
                voting against a proper submission of it at a general election. As it is I do not
                consider any question before us on any amendment, said to be "referred" to this
                General Assembly by the last one, and so shall cast my vote I am now, as I always
                have been, opposed to prohibition, because I believe the principle wrong and
                unjust.</p>

              <p>Mr. HUSTON said: We have had this matter discussed from a legal standpoint, but I
                propose to discuss it from the standpoint of a citizen of Indiana. It is not for
                lawyers alone to decide whether or not this question is properly entered, but the
                people of the State will take this matter in their own hands and decide. Why was
                this amendment introduced? It was because 46,000 voters of the State requested it
                that it was introduced. It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that this matter has been
                fully discussed. The press throughout the State, for the last three or four weeks,
                has been teeming with the considerition of these resolutions. I do not suppose that
                any argument could change one vote. I think that every member has decided how he
                will vote. I say, however, that this is not a party question, and that it was not
                introduced as a party question.</p>

              <p> On motion, the Committee rose, reported progress and asked leave to sit again.</p>

              <p> The report was concurred in by the House and then the House adjourned. </p>

            <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order for mis hour-10:30 o'clock-being
              the consideration of the resolution and Committee reports thereon concerning the
              status of the proposed prohibition amendment to the Constitution, by the Senate as in
                <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>.</p>

            <p>The Senate thereupon resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>
              [Mr. Henry in the Chair] and proceeded with the discussion.</p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Delaware, said: I do not propose to make an extended legal argument as
              to whether the amendments are properly before us or not; that has been done by others.
              Nor do I propose in this discussion to make an exhaustive research among the laws and
              decisions of Iowa and Kansas, or any other States, to learn what we should do in the
              amendment of our Constitution. Nor do I propose to ask foreign authorities to
              determine for us whether the amendments are properly before this Legislature or not.
              We are not governed by me laws and customs of those States They settle their
              Constitutional questions in accordance with their awn rules and precedents. We should
              do the same. Their Constitutions and requirements for amendments are different from
              ours, and those constructions that would be applicable and appropriate to them would
              not be to us. We can get all the information that is necessary in the settlement of
              this vexed question by applying to our Court decisions and Legislative records.
              Although our Supreme Court has never rendered an opinion directly defining what is
              necessary in a Constitutional record, yet its decision in 30 Indiana and other cases,
              by implication, gives to the pending amendments all she record that is essential for
              them to have. There is not a decision of a Court or a law anywhere in our State that
              would invalidate them. There is not an amendment to the Constitution that has not the
              same record, declared deficient and fatal in the present amendments by Democratic
              Senators, and yet that they are all a legal part of the Constitution has never been
              questioned. Our Supreme Court has never been applied to by importunate creditors, who
              imagined they had been wronged by the adoption of these various amendments, to declare
              them void. The State has moved quietly along in her simple grandeur for thirty years,
              wholly unconscious of this legislative storm that threatens to dismantle her I ask
              Democratic Senators to pause and consider well the step they are taking, for bad
              precedents are fixed curses. In addition to the decision of the Supreme Court, we have
              the journals of the two Houses, both attesting to the the passage of the joint
              resolution. In addition to that we have it in its enrolled form, signed by the
              officers of the two Houses and filed in the office of the Secretary of State, the
              depository of the laws of the State, by the Governor It does seem to me, from the
              above facts, which have always been regarded as sufficient, that the object of the
              Constitution in having the proceedings spread upon the journals is fully met. </p>

            <p>Mr. MAY preferred to vote against the amendments on their passage, thus reflecting
              the views of his people. But it happens a question of jurisdiction has arisen-a legal
              proposition that must be solved by legal rules and legal practice. He could not come
              to the conclusion that these amendments are properly before this General Assembly. No
              lawyer will say we should go out- side of the Constitution [Article 16, Sections 1 and
                <pb n="115" xml:id="VAA8558-21-114"/> 2] to ascertain the only way in which
              amendments to that instrument can be considered by the General Assembly. It is as
              plain to a man of common sense as the noon-day sun. Much has been said about outside
              authorities, but he defied any one to show any decision of any Court in Indiana on the
              two sections of the article referred to. Then if no authority of the Supreme Court cm
              be found construing those sections, what next should be done? It is the custom of
              lawyers to go to sister States for next best authority. It is not necessary to go far
              to find a decision exactly on this point-there is a recent one in the State of Iowa
              which covers the whole point. </p>

            <p>Mr. DUNCAN regarded this as a question of purely Constitutional law, and can not and
              should not be made a proper subject of party caucus. No caucus can bind his judgment
              and conscience up in a subject of Constitutional law. The Senator from Wayne (Mr.
              Foulke) dropped into a political threat unworthy the dignified legal argument he made.
              The Constitution is paramount to the Legislature, and its acts must be controlled by
              that instrument. The journals of the two Houses are made the Constitutional depository
              for proposed amendments to the Constitution clearly contemplating if a proposed
              amendment fail that only a brief entry need be made, but if agreed to it must be
              entered with the yeas and nays thereon and referred to the next General Assembly. The
              rule of construction of stymies should also apply here. The ratification of the
              amendment now under consideration would prove a nullity and be overthrown by the
              Courts. Viewing it as a partisan, its submission at the general election next year
              would prove beneficial to the party with which he acted: but being sworn to support
              the sixteenth article as well as the entire instrument, he could not conscientiously
              favor the minority report. He read from manuscript, and when he concluded-</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. BELL the Committee rose, reported progress and asked leave to sit
              again at l:45 o'clock. </p>

            <p>The Senate concurred in the report of the Committee. </p>

            <p>Mr. SAYRE believed this to be the first time in the history of the Democracy of
              Indiana when they have been driven to Republican Iowa for succor, and the only time
              when Republicans are compelled to cite almost entirely Democratic authority and
              Democratic precedents in favor of the adoption of the minority report. He was
              understood to say that in construing the Constitution, it is not always to be done
              according to the letter. Every lawyer who reads the Constitution for himself does so
              by the aid of certain rules of construction, because of the infirmity of human nature
              and our language, which become to him part and parcel of the Constitution itself. The
              spirit of the instrument itself is to be determined by many circumstances. In this
              case, if the word "entered" does not mean to spread at length upon the journal, then
              it is the duty of every Senator, if he can find in the dictionary or in the common
              acceptation of the meaning of the word, any meaning that will permit another action
              for the purpose of accomplishing this result, it is his sworn duty lo give it that
              meaning and let the progress of these amendments go on. Another rule which ought to be
              applied in determining questions of this character is to look at precedents. The
              Wabash and Erie Canal precedent is one that ought to be binding upon the consciences
              and oaths of members of this General Assembly. Referring to the plea of strict
              constructionists, he declared that no journals of any General Assembly have ever yet
              been published according to the strict construction of the Constitutional provision,
              that "each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings and publish the same."</p>

            <p>Mr VAN VORHIS said: I should not have troubled this Committee with my views had I not
              believed it robe a duty The burden imposed by my convictions of duty is not a Lght
              one, and the road it compels me to travel is not likely to lead to preferment. It is
              not always easy to sink every personal consideration, and in the face of
              misconception, misrepresentation and personal abuse and in opposition to the wishes of
              many party and personal friends be guided alone by convictions of right. The most
              difficult thing to answer is the sneer of those who effect contempt for anything like
              convictions, and who desiring to banish all moral questions from the political arena,
              do not trouble themselves to inquire whether even ordinary moral conduct remains. So
              far as I know, with one exception I urn, alone in my party on this floor in the
              position I have taken on this question. But, sir, if my late colleague [Mr. Chapman]
              had been permitted to remain with us, I know where he would have stood with a courage
              that followed duty in the face of fire and flame and leaden storms into the very jaws
              of death. He would not have been dismayed by party clamor, but would have stood for
              what he believed to be right though he stood alone. Among the last words he addressed
              to the public upon this subject were these: </p>

            <p>"Every member is entitled to exercise the divine attribute of conscience, and has a
              right, and it is his duty, not to follow any instructions from his constituents which,
              in his judgment, require him to disregard the Constitution."</p>

            <p>Is there any man on this floor who in sober thoughtfulness, dare face his own
              conscience and say he was not right? The meaning of the word instruct, as taken from
              Webster, is "to communicate knowledge to, to teach; to form by precept; to educate; to
              inform " The considerations mentioned (referring to arguments preceding) and this
              meaning of the word ought to be sufficient, to convince any thoughtful man that no
              such thing as "authoritative instructions," "mandates issued," was ever dreamed of by
              the Convention when Section 76 of the Bill of Rights was adopted.</p>

            <p>The fact is, we stand face to face with a duty imposed upon us by the Constitution,
              and individual member must, from necessity, decide for himself the bounds of that
              duty. There is no other tribunal to which he can apply except his own judgment. The
              highest and only instructions of which I have any knowledge is the Constitution; and
              that Constitution, according to the convictions of my best judgment, makes it my duty
              to decide according to the best light I have the questions before us. </p>

            <p>I have received no other instructions, and if I had they could not absolve me from my
              duty to obey the Constitution. </p>

            <p>This is my conclusion, and I shall act in accordance with it when called upon to vote
              upon the question contained in these reports, or any one or all the proposed
              amendments if the judgment of this Committee and the Senate shall see that they are
              now properly before the this General Assembly. </p>

            <p>In discussing this resolution I desire to say that I do so as one most earnestly
              interested in the temperance cause. I protest against any argument that assumes that
              opposition in this resolution means opposition to temperance reform.</p>

            <p>I know, sir there are persons who, believing no way to exist by which temperance
              reform can be brought about except the method proposed in this resolution, do not seem
              to have toleration sufficient to en able them to conceive how any man can be opposed,
              to it and be sincere, and they are <pb n="116" xml:id="VAA8558-21-115"/> ready at once
              to denounce anyone who doubts the practical wisdom of this proposed amendment as
              dishonest. And the man who has the misfortune to fall under the ban of their
              condemnation may expect to have his reputation assailed, no matter what it may have
              been before. He will have offensive names applied to him and it will be hinted, if it
              is not proudly asserted, that his opposition is due to the fact that he is himself a
              slave to the drink habit.</p>

            <p> The Senator from Vigo and myself are the only members of the Republican side of the
              Senate who voted against this resolution in the last Senate. I do not know how it has
              been with the Senator, but I have had some very unpleasant things said to me and about
              me on account of that vote and subsequent expressions of my views, by a few people who
              somehow have not been able to realize that it is within the bounds of possibility that
              their ideas of the proper method of furthering the interests of temperance reform may
              not correct.</p>

            <p> There are some people who, from the very poverty of their ideas, must answer an
              argument by misrepresentation, personal abuse or slander, or say nothing at all. Such
              individuals are prone to attach themselves to any moral reform that has attracted
              public attention. They try, by unusual zeal, to put themselves in the lead. They are
              to be known by the vehemence with which they denounce any one who differs from them in
              regard to methods; and in this they never distinguish between friend and foe.</p>

            <p> They are zealous, but not "according to knowledge;" sincere, but mistake sincerity
              for wisdom; honest, maybe, but if so belonging to that class of whom Tupper says: </p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. JEWETT the House then resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of
                the Whole</orgName> (Mr. Jewett in the Chair), and resumed the consideration of the
              three reports from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> on the question as to
              whether the proposed Constitutional amendments were properly referred to this General
              Assembly. </p>

            <p>Mr. STEWART said he did not intend to detain the House at any length by discussing
              the question under consideration. As a member of the Committee it will be expected
              that I say something on the question. It has been under discussion by members on this
              floor and by the people of the State for many months. As Representatives we are each
              to discharge our duty in this matter in the light in which we may discern the question
              of the legality of the pending amendments and believing as I do that every member of
              this House has made up bis mind on the question, and that the conviction Is firmly
              fixed, I do not feel called upon to debate the question at length. In my opinion, if
              the Senate had on yesterday reached a final vote and the House had done the same the
              result would not have been any different from what it will be when the final vote is
              taken. I can better serve my constituents by voting correctly on this question than by
              consuming the valuable time of the House in useless debate. It is a question, however,
              that each member must settle for himself, and I will patiently hear any member who
              feels called upon to express himself in regard to the legality of the pending
              amendments. The people are much more interested in how we shall vote than they are in
              what we shall say before we vote. That certain amendments to the Constitution were
              proposed and received a majority of the votes of members elected to each of the two
              Houses of the last General Assembly; of this there is no doubt, and that an exact copy
              of these amendments can be procured there is no doubt. I think the proper entery has
              been made on the journal. The object of entering the resolutions on the journal in
              that they may be identified. There is no pretense such that the identical resolution
              can be offered to the General Assembly. The public is as well informed of the identity
              of these resolutions as though they had been entered in on the journals with every "i"
              dotted and every "t" crossed. It is not dangerous to submit any question to the
              people. In this matter we enact no law, we simply prepare the way for the legal voters
              of the State to determine whether or not they desire certain amendments to the
              Constitution. I believe, as a lawyer, that the amendments can be legally submitted to
              the people, and of right ought to be so submitted. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY said: This is a deliberative body. It is not a caucus nor a political
              Convention It exercises the highest power and occupies the most responsible position
              that it is possible to confer upon man. It is one of the results of a great experiment
              that was begun upon this continent over a century ago, under circumstances that
              astonished the civilized world. We stand here to-day as a great inquest upon every
              fundamental element which carried into practice gave us this Government. We have no
              governments in this country except the law. We have no law except that made under
              prescribed forms. The first prescribed form is the Constitution, and our Constitution
              is the result of the deliberative judgment of the representatives of the people
              assembled in Convention over fifty years ago. Thirty years ago a Convention was called
              and gave us our present Constitution. The first obligation taken at the bar of this
              House by every member thereto is to support the Constitution. This support means more
              than tacit assent thereto. It means more than mere <pb n="117" xml:id="VAA8558-21-116"
              /> obedience. It implies sacred duty. And all attempts to avoid or evade any of its
              provisions should be condemned. The Democratic party, in its last Convention, declared
              in favor of the submission of the proposed amendments in accordance with the provision
              of the Constitution for its owe amendment. One of these provisions is that the
              proposed amendment shall be entered upon the journals of the two Houses. I do not
              propose to inquire at any great length into the reasons for this provision They are
              manifest as precaution against any mistake and fraud. Bun it is enough for me that
              there is such a requirement in the constitution which I have taken, in common with
              other members of the House, an oath to support. Has this requirement of the
              Constitution been complied with? Is is found upon examination that none of the
              proposed amendments have been entered on the journals of either House. There is a
              well-known and recognized distinction in the proceedings all Judicial, Legislative and
              deliberative bodies between filing, noting and entering. </p>

            <p>The Committee rose, reported progress and asked leave to sit again at 2 o'clock.</p>

            <p>The report was concurred in by the House. </p>

            <p>The House took a recess for dinner.</p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>The House reassembled at 2 o'clock, and immediately resolved itself into a
                <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName> [Mr. Jewett in the chair].</p>

            <p> Mr. MOODY (continuing his speech) said: The present Constitution requires that "if
              such proposed amendment be agreed to, it shall be entered upon the journal." Looking
              over the journals, the proposed amendments are not to be found there. No entry of them
              is to be found. The fact that they are not to be found there entered is prima facie
              evidence that they were not agreed to. The only evidence of their passage provided
              for-namely, their entry on the journal-is not found. Mr. Moody continued at some
              length, citing authorities, reading from the Constitution, etc.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILEY said: I have no desire in the decision of this question other than to do
              my duty under the Constitution as I understand it and voice the will of the people,
              whose servant I am. The question under consideration is not free from doubt. If it
              were free from doubt we would not be discussing it. It seems to me that my duty is
              marked out very plain. I would be the last person who would undertake to amend or
              change the original law of the land did I believe that the essential steps were not
              constitutionally taken. In a Government like ours the people are the arbiters of all
              power. I am glad that I live in a country where the people can speak and the voice of
              the people shall be the sovereign law. The question is: Are there any amendments which
              were proposed in the last General Assembly and presented to this General Assembly for
              our consideration? I will admit that different tribunals in different States have made
              different decisions on questions similar to the one we are now discussing. The case in
              Iowa which that Supreme Court recently decided, was not similar to that in Indiana.
              The journals of the two Houses of the Iowa Legislature do not show that the amendments
              passed the two Houses of one General Assembly, and hence the Courts held that the next
              General Assembly could not assume jurisdiction over the same. If that was the case in
              Indiana, it would be very different with us. But the journals of the two Houses of the
              Fifty-second General Assembly show that the amendments did not pass the two Houses two
              years ago. This was not the case in Iowa, and hence the Court held that the subsequent
              Legislature could not take jurisdiction of the question. The journal is only to keep a
              record of the action of the House. No gentleman will attempt to say that all the
              proceedings must be spread at length upon the journals. There is another fact. Bills
              and resolutions must be numbered; no two bills or resolutions can have the same
              number. I want to say to the gentlemen here to-day that every bill and resolution
              passed two years ago can be traced by any member of this HOuse, and there is no doubt
              about it. I find by referring to the journal that four joint resolutions were passed
              by the last General Assembly. In the Senate there were two, and in the House I find
              that on page 1,016 of the journal the gentleman from Fayette [Mr. Huston] introduced
              House joint resolution number seven. I find that by tracing it through the journal
              that it was properly acted upon by the House, and that the Clerk informed the Senate
              of the passage of the resolution. I find by reference to the Senate journal it was
              reported to the Senate, and that it passed that body, receiving a majority of the
              votes of the members; that it was returned to this House, where it received a majority
              of the votes of the members of this House on its final passage, and that the same was
              properly signed by the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate. I turn to
              the published acts of the Assembly of 1881, and I find there certain laws and certain
              joint resolutions that were agreed to by that General Assembly and among them is House
              joint resolution number seven. M. W. continued at some length.</p>

            <p> Mr. Speaker BYNUM said: I trust that the members of this House will pardon me for
              violating those rules which under proper consideration might have required me to
              remain silent. I do not know that I would have violated those rules had it not been
              that the House resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>, there
              by giving me an opportunity to enter upon the discussion of this question. I do not
              know that I shall throw any light upon this question. It has been discussed in its
              various phases until it has been worn threadbare. It is claimed that these amendments
              were properly pressed and properly referred to this General Assembly. I can say with
              the gentleman from Benton, Mr. Wiley, that there are amendments for and against this
              proposition. Now, I apprehend that it makes no difference whether an amendment is
              proposed by a joint resolution, a concurrent resolution or in some other manner. I
              care not what you call it, whether you call it a bill, joint resolution or what not,
              it must come under the provisions of the Constitution, Article 16, Sections 1 and 2. </p>

            <p> What led to the formation of the Constitution of 1852? Under the Constitution of
              1816 there was no clause providing for its own amendment. And members well know that
              this provision was the most important that was proposed in that Convention. Several
              propositions were proposed, but it was decided that this was the safest manner
              proposed for the amendment of the Constitution. The father of that provision was
              Robert Dale Owe[n?] who was one of the most energetic and active members of the
              Convention. I am not here to dispute the right of the people to change their form of
              government, but I am here to say the people of a sovereign State have no right to
              change their organic law except in the manner laid down in the Constitution. The
              question is simply narrowed down as to how the provisions of the Constitution are
              construed. Gentlemen do not claim that they found the resolution itself on the
              journal, but they found a description of a resolution corresponding in number to the
              resolution No. 7 . The word "entered" means to go into. We have heard that this
              question has been passed upon by two Governors; that it was passed upon in the case of
              the Wabash and Erie Canal, and we all respect the decisions of these Governors, but
              their decisions are of little weight in comparison with the decisions of the Supreme
              Court of two States. Their decisions are not binding upon this Legislature. In order
              to fin d decisions that are binding we should go <pb n="118" xml:id="VAA8558-21-117"/>
              to the decisions of the Supreme Courts of our country. The Constitution requires
              amendments proposed to it to be entered upon the journals of each House, and it
              requires no lawyer, it requires no professor, to understand what that plain and simple
              provision means. Gentlemen, after admitting that the letter of the Constitution has
              not been complied with, contend that it has been complied with in spirit. It is not in
              the power of any Legislature to provide any other means to amend their Constitution
              than the means provided in the Constitution itself. Our Constitution is our
              Government; outside of the Constitution we have no Government. Gentlemen say they have
              traced this prohibitory amendment resolution through the several stages of legislation
              to its final passage, but can any one take the journals of the two Houses and tell
              what is embodied in that resolution? No one will attempt to do it. Mr. B. read from
              the Constitution and from numerous judicial decisions. When he had concluded-</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. Shively, the Committee rose, reported progress, and asked leave to

                    <salute>Hon. Marvin Campbell, Senator, Indianapolis:</salute>
                  </opener>

                  <p> D<hi rend="sc">EAR SIR</hi>-We had supposed when Mr. Winterbotham published
                    his notice of contest of Major Calkins' election as Representative to Congress
                    from this District that we should have the opportunity to prove before Congress
                    the falsity of his charges against us. But as he has abandoned that contest and
                    contented himself with denouncing us before the body of which you are a member,
                    we meet him there.</p>

                  <p>Please state to the Senate for us that any and all charges that we have
                    terrorized, or bulldozed, as the phrase is, or intimidated any of our workmen
                    into voting for or against anybody at any election. National, State or
                    municipal, are malignant falsehoods. In this denial we include all statements
                    that we have threatened dismissal from our works to any one on account of his
                    political course; that we hate paid any one in any way for his vote, or that we
                    have prevented the free exercise of the suffrage of any of our twenty-two
                    hundred employes.</p>

                  <p> We will add that, like American citizens generally, our views on National and
                    State questions have been freely and frankly expressed, and will continue to be
                    so expressed-a right, we suppose, our falsifier claims for himself-but the
                    charge he makes against us of intimidating our workmen, or any other citizens,
                    to compel them to vote as we do, is a wicked and groundless calumny and
                    insulting to the freemen who work for us and vote as independently as we do.</p>

                  <p> We ask therefore, that a Select Committee of five fair-minded and impartial
                    Senators be appointed by your presiding officer, the Lieutenant Governor, a
                    majority of whom shall be Democrats, to visit our works, and we pledge that they
                    shall be given the largest liberty to probe this matter to the fullest extent. </p>

            <p> Mr. CAMPBELL said: I presume that this petition will properly be referred to the
                <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName>, and as this Committee has both the
              requisites asked for-that is, a Democratic majority, and is composed throughout of men
              whom I believe to be fair-minded-I certainly will be glad to have it go to them, and
              the investigation made by them If I may be allowed the privilege but; for a moment, I
              urge that the Senate do as the petitioners have offered to do-that is, allow, upon the
              part of the Committee, "the largest liberty to probe this matter to the fullest
              extent" and want to urge upon the Committee that they make the investigation prompt,
              and searching, and thorough I ask this in behalf of the Messrs. Studebaker and Oliver,
              and also in the name of justice. By a memorial from Mr. Winterbotham interpreted by
              the Senator from Jackson, standing in his seat upon this floor to refer directly to
              the Studebaker Wagon Works and the Oliver Chilled Plow Works, these men now stand
              charged before this body with as gross a crime as can be perpetrated by any American
              citizen, that of Interfering with the free ex<pb n="120" xml:id="VAA8558-21-119"
              />ercise, and depriving other citizens of the right o f the sacred elective franchise.
              This is said to have been done not by armed force, but a subtle and more potent
              influence-threatened poverty and want-an enemy before whose threatening men to whom
              armed force would have no terror, will bow in servility because of love for family. It
              is not trivial matter to stand before the great State of Indiana, charged in its
              newspaper columns and upon the record and the floors of its legislative halls such
              monstrous crimes as these. If the charges are true, the perpetrators should be branded
              by the seal of an investigation and ostracised from the society of loyal men. If the
              charges so widely and so boldly are made false, what punishment is severe enough and
              what words of execration strong enough to measure the contempt due any man, or men,
              whose malice would seek to injure so broadly and so deeply by such dangerous untruths.
              As to whether the charges be true or false I would not consider it proper and do not
              desire now to offer a single argument or state a fact that might prejudice the
              Committee. A few days ago, it will be remembered, that I rose from my seat and asked
              to be allowed to answer the charges made by the Senator from Jackson against these
              petitioners, but contrary to every rule of courtesy I was denied the privilege. Now
              the doors of these manufactories are thrown wide open and you can seek the facts
              yourselves, and while I will gladly aid the Committee in any way they may desire, I
              have no wish to prejudice them. If it should be true that the recollection of the
              cowering form of the Senator from Jackson, cringing under the parliamentary table and
              calling upon his associates to surround it and protect him from the truths which I
              asked to sate, seems to the Committees to be a logically eloquent confession of the
              falsity of the charges, that is a circumstantial prejudice for which I am in no sense
              responsible. If it should be found by the investigation that these petitioners have
              been grossly wronged and foully misrepresented for the purpose of calling attention
              from other crimes of other men, I hope it will be so reported, and the real criminal
              and falsifier be named. If it should be found that the elective franchise was at the
              last election in the Thirteenth District influenced and corrupted by every means which
              genius could devise and money command, I hope such facts will be fully reported, and
              by whom and in what manner. If it should be shown that the workmen of manufacturing
              establishments were compelled to band themselves together, and go to the polls under
              the protection of each other to avoid the assaults and coercion of hired agents, I
              want that fact reported and by whom these agents were hired, and what kind of work
              they did. </p>

            <p> If it should be shown that after the election hundreds of dollars were paid or
              offered as the purchase price of false affidavits, I want that fact reported, and by
              whom and when all the facts are shown honestly, candidly and thoroughly, I want to sit
              here with the Senators upon this floor, forgetting that we are Democrats and
              Republicans, forgetting for the time that we are friends to aught else but our great
              Commonwealth, and remembering that the elective franchise is our great bulwark of
              safety, and must be shielded from every weakening influence, whether it be armed foe,
              autocratic employer or monied demagogue, and in the light of truth and love of right
              devise the best means for the protection of all and against all. </p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN stated the character of the information he had received in support of the
              statement he made on the floor some time ago, to be that the proprietors of these
              manufacturing establishments had collected their employes together in groups or bands
              of from ten to thirty and had marched them to the polls to vote such tickets as their
              bosses provided for them. He had seen and read a large package of such affidavits. It
              had been a matter stated in the public press throughout the State, and the Senator
              from St. Joseph [Mr. Campbell] will not deny that the gates of these establishments
              were shut to any Democratic Committee or to any Democratic conveyance to everybody
              except Republican agents, but the conveyances of these establishments were famished in
              charge of those men. He doubted if the Senator will deny that for he had seen it sworn
              to more than twenty times. He did not believe that there was a particle of doubt but
              that fraud and crime enough could be traced to Mr. Calkins or agents to show his
              election was procured by bribery and fraud. Even that would not seat Mr. Winterbotham,
              who would have to run the race over again, who was too old to engage in such a contest
              again, and because abandoning the contest is now hunted down by poltroons with not
              one-tenth the brains of that good old citizen. He hoped the <orgName>Committee on
                Elections</orgName> will be clothed with full power to make investigation into the
              conduct of these establishment, which may prove a worse advertisement to their
              business than anything that has hitherto been said. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr SPANN the motion to refer to the Committee on Elections was amended
              by empowering the Committee to send for persons and papers necessary to a full
              investigation of the matter.</p>

            <p>The motion to refer, as amended, was agreed to.</p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR took the chair and announced the special order to be the
              consideration of the resolution and reports from the <orgName>Judiciary
                Committee</orgName> [see pages 49, 76, 98 and 105 of the Brevier Reports] by the
              Senate as in <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>.</p>

            <p> Thereupon the Senate resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName> [Mr. Henry in the chair] the question being on th emotion to adopt
              the majority report.</p>

            <p> Mr. RISTINE contended that the enrolled resolution is the best evidence of what was
              done by the last General Assembly, and being such, furnishes all, and more than an
              entry on the journals could supply. In 1872 the Legislature found an amendment to the
              Constitution in the same condition as the present, except there was no political bias
              or prejudice to warp the judgment, and under such circumstances the amendment was
              passed by the vote of every member of each House, save one. The action then taken upon
              this legal question when it was new in this State, and when it received close
              attention, was the same as that adopted by the Supreme Court of Kansas and in accord
              with the long list of authorities which have been cited. That amendment was ratified
              by the people and is to-day a part of our Constitution, and by no one has it ever been
              called into question. What higher authority can there be than this?-the method which
              has heretofore obtained in amending the Constitution.</p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN should vote for the minority report for the reason if the joint resolution
              No. 7 is not before the Senate properly, it ought to be. He knew that two years ago it
              was reported from the House to the Senate; that it passed this Senate by 26 votes, and
              that it is now upon the statute books. He should not, by his vote, allow the neglect
              of employes of the Senate, ignorantly or intentionally, to deprive his constituency of
              that which they want. He should vote for the minority report for the reason that 3,000
              or 4,000 voters of his District have petitioned for an amendment to the Constitution
              that shall prohibit the manufacture or sale of ardent spirits as a beverage. The place
              of a representative of the people is a very sacred trust. This is a representative
              Government, and representing 12,000 votes he held it makes no difference what his
              ideas or his desires of a law or proposition are, if his people desired a law it is
              his duty to vote for it. He is a Democrat and believes in the great Democratic
              principle that the representative should vote the will of his constituency for those
              measure which bring the greatest good to the greatest number, and that is another
              reason why he should vote for this amendment and if an opportunity offers he would
              vote to submit to the people for ratification at the next general election. </p>

            <p> Mr. McCLURE was very sorry that these proposed amendments are not found correctly
              spread upon the journals of the two Houses according to the requirements of the
              Constitution. Though standing to-day as he did two years ago in the other branch of
              the General Assembly, opposed to these Constitutional amendments, he had listened with
              interested to the arguments of Senators, and had been greatly edified by the legal
              disquisitions. The question upon which the decision of this subject hinges is on the
              rendition or definition of the word "shall" in the Constitution. In our simplicity in
              the use of the English language, when we who have heretofore engaged in legislation,
              employed or used the word "shall" in the laws, we consider that term imperative,
              obligatory, etc., etc. Endeavoring to sit as a Juror, having a part in the decision of
              this question, his present convictions are that giving a true construction to the
              Constitution, these amendments are not properly before the Legislature, and though
              open to conviction even to the last words said on this subject, he expected to support
              the majority report of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. </p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY'S excuse for saying anything upon this question was its importance,
              attracting as it does most earnest attention from all parts of the State, a question
              fraught with great interest not only upon the immediate point involved, but upon the
              effect it will have hereafter in this State, upon what shall constitute a sufficient
              transaction as to the mode and manner of submitting Constitutional amendments. He
              intended to give his views in a few words. The Constitutional provision of Article 15,
              Sections 1 and 2 is directory and not mandatory. The only other provision of the kind
              in the Constitution is where it requires when a bill is vetoed that the objections of
              the Governor shall be entered at large upon the journals. There is not much of a
              difference between the two, but the difference is significant. The same question being
              discussed now was presented to the Legislature in 1872. That was no fool Legislature.
              An examination of the journals and the Brevier Reports will show the question was
              fully, fairly and candidly discussed and decided according to law: and it is scarcely
              worth while to discuss that proposition much longer. From all over the State of
              Indiana there have come up petitions from over 42,900 voters asking that these
              amendments be submitted to a vote of the people, and not only that but that they shall
              be submitted at a special election. </p>

            <p> Mr. McINTOSH said at the time he was nominated to represent the Counties of Greene
              and Davies in the Senate he promised, at the request of Democratic friends, that he
              would vote to agree to the Constitutional amendments. He repelled the insinuation that
              an effort has been made by Democratic Senators, either in or out of caucus, to control
              the Democratic vote in the Senate. As far as the legal question is concerned, the
              lawyers on both sides of the Senate stand as they do upon the main question-a singular
              commentary upon the judgment and conscience of Senators. Every Senator who believes
              this amendment is not legally before this Legislature didn't want the amendment
              passed, and every Senator who says, by supporting the minority report, that he
              believes this proposition is before the Legislature is in favor of the passage of the
              Constitutional amendments. He proposed to give the doubt in favor of the people upon
              this proposition. He read from the Brevier Reports, volume 20, what his able and
              honorable predecessor said upon this very proposition two years ago, and he should
              follow him. </p>

            <p> Mr. BELL said: There is a plain duty before us to be performed. How shall we do it?
              The Constitution of the State of Indiana defines our power-it defines our duty. By
              virtue of that instrument we are here, and by virtue of that instrument alone. We have
              neither a legal nor moral right to disregard its plain provisions. I want to say in
              the outset that I am glad I belong to that portion of the people and to that school of
              politicians who believe in a strict construction of all Constitutional provisions. In
              this sort of construction and in this position alone is safety. By <pb n="122"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-121"/> following this path, in my humble judgment, alone can we
              preserve and perpetuate the rights and liberties of the people. I am not here to
              dispute but that the people have the right as well as the power, to shape and mould
              and form their organic law almost as they please. They have with reference to all
              matters that rightfully concern Government. When they meet in a Constitutional
              Convention they provide in terms for its own amendment-the manner in which that
              Constitution might and should be amended. And whenever we step aside from the plain
              path thus marked out, and moment we begin to infringe on the rights of the people,
              which they have reserved to themselves. Let me read again this Constitutional
              provision, although familiar to all of you. Let us consider whether there be any room
              for construction. If there be no ambiguity, then construction has no duty to perform.
              Let us see. [Mr. B reads from the Constitution.] If I am able to understand the
              English language there is no ambiguity about this. The language is plain and easily
              understood. It is related of Benjamin Franklin that when on a visit to Paris he was
              invited to attend a meeting of the Academy of Sciences, when there was learned
              discussion going on among the savans-why, when you take a pail of water and put in a
              live fish the weight of the pail of water with the fish in it was no wise increased.
              It occurred to Franklin it might be well to weigh the pail of water both before and
              after the fish was put in. He did so and found the weight was increased just what the
              fish would weigh. So we had better apply in this case a plain rule first, before we go
              any further. </p>

            <p> There have been some strange positions taken here by lawyers-startling positions to
              me because destructive of all those principles which underlie Constitutional
              government I regard all Constitutional provisions in the nature of all limitations and
              restrictions, limiting and not conferring enlarged powers. I submit to lawyers if that
              be not the correct rule; if that is not the theory of the Constitutional government?
              Then I have said if there be no room for construction there is no office for
              construction to perform. Will you allow me to call attention to authority on that
              subject. Authorities in this line seem strangely to have escaped the command of my
              brethren on the other side. An author, known and revered wherever the common law
              system is enforced and whereever the English language is spoken or read, a profound
              jurist, a learned lawyer and a pure man, one whose words have great weight in every
              tribunal where they are quoted; a life-long Republican, though not a partisan; one
              whose views and judgment can not be said to be warped by politics or prejudice. I
              refer to Judge Cooley, of Michigan, at whose feet I have sat and drank from the
              never-failing fountain of learning that flowed from his lips and mind. I read from
              Cooley' Constitutional Limitations, page 68. And I want to call especial attention of
              some of my Democratic brethren to this, who seem to think that because of pledges
              given when this question was not before them and their constituency, they may
              disregard some questions as important <sic>(?)</sic> as the Constitution itself. [Mr.
              B. read from page 68]</p>

            <p> Now, what does our Constitution say? It says proposed amendments shall be entered on
              the journals of the two Houses, and the yeas and nays shall be entered, and they shall
              be referred to a succeeding General Assembly. Is there room for construction here? Can
              there be any? Let me read from another eminent writer on Constitutional law. I read
              from Segwick on Constitutions, 377. Also first Peters, 46, 64 Reports of the Supreme
              Court of the United States. As I have said Constitutional provisions are restricting
              and limiting. We must regard a Constitution as having been framed in careful and
              measured terms and guarded words. I am going to talk after awhile about statutes
              mandatory and the rules that govern their construction, but I will show that such a
              rule will not apply to the construction of a Constitution. The reason is apparent.
              Statutes are enacted carelessly and without a close regard to the language that is
              used in them. Let me read from what Cooley says on the subject. [Mr. B. read] Now, it
              is not for us to inquire what one of the provisions in the Constitution is essential
              or what one is important, or what is more essential or more important than another. It
              is enough for us to know that power which was above, behind and beyond us introduced a
              provision in the Constitution. We have no power to say whether it be for the best or
              the worst, it is for us to obey. Our Constitution says amendments proposed to it shall
              be entered with the yeas and nays upon the journals, and shall be referred to the next
              General Assembly. These are conditions precedent. It is true the Senator from Madison
              [Mr. Henry] says this is not true-that they are not conditions precedent, but I want
              to say no lawyer will stake his reputation unmixed with politics on such a statement
              as this; and no lawyer ought to make it mixed with politics without having his cheek
              mantled with the blush of shame. I have no right to charge the Senator with
              insincerity, but I don't think he meant what he said himself-he is too good a lawyer
              for that. The whole thing in a nut-shell is whether we have authority to pass upon
              these amendments. Before we act upon them at all the precedent steps must be taken;
              and the question is: Have they been taken? I heard the Senator from Henry [Mr. Bundy]
              say that this provision of the Constitution was merely directory and not mandatory.
              But what sort of authority did he back it up with? The Senator found, where a Court
              held somewhere, upon a statute which provided a Commissioner "shall" do certain acts,
              that that word was directory and not mandatory. </p>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY (interposing): I found that three of the States of this Union having a
              Constitution prescribing that all laws "shall" be in a certain form, the word was held
              to be directory.</p>

            <p> Mr. BELL (resuming): I am coming to that in a moment, but I want to show how the
              Senator attempted to throw dust in the eyes of those attempting to consider these
              things. What lawyer does not know that with construction of statutes of a remedial
              nature and character the Courts sometimes, in order to give effect to an act already
              done under that statute, will hold the word "shall" to be directory, and not
              mandatory; but I want to say, as a lawyer, that when I have made this statement I have
              stated the only case in which a Court was ever justified in doing that thing, and even
              Courts that have done that, have been severely criticized by Courts of the highest
              standing in the country. But some Courts in construing statutes have gone as far, when
              an act is already past, as to hold that the word "shall" is directory and not
              mandatory, and in no other case where either a Court or Legislature was ever justified
              in holding that the word "shall," when used in reference to acts done under the
              Constitution, should or could be held to be directory merely. Even in statutes where
              the public are interested, the word "may" is invariable construed as "shall" by the
              Courts. The rules is, "may" may be construed as synonymous with shall, etc. [Mr. B
              reads.] This is the rule, and yet Senators-grave and reverend Senators, learned
              Senators in the law-get up and have us apply a construction of a provision of the
              organic law, with the same sort of rules and reasonings that are applied in the
              construction of remedial statutes about road viewers, and such trivial cases. Lawyers
              influenced by politics smarting under the party lash, eager to get some party
              advantage, will come and make such statements as <pb n="123" xml:id="VAA8558-21-122"
              />this. It is astonishing. It goes far to cause me to lose confidence, not only in the
              members of my profession, but in some degree in the profession itself. In support of
              my proposition that a different rule applies 10 the construction of Constitutional
              provisions from that of statutes I read from Cooley on Constitutional law, pp 94 and
              95-a sort; of legal point which I recommend to my brethren on the other side of the
              Senate. [Mr. B. reads.] So. I say, when the people in their Constitution undertake to
              say they will obligate a portion of their power to amend the Constitution and
              undertake to point out a method to proceed to do that thing, they put in that
              Constitution what they regard as essential nothing more nothing less; and it is not
              for us to determine which w &lt;s essential and which was not. [Mr. B. reads.] Now I
              don't know what more could be added to that view that is the view that is in accord
              with the theory of Constitutional government, and in accord with the dictates of
              common sense. No exercise of common sense will lead to any other conclusion than when
              the Constitution reads "shall" it means "shall," it does not mean "may " When it lays
              down a method by which amendments shall be proposed and adopted, it means that is the
              only method. It ought not to need a man learned in the law to construe it-it is so
              plain that he who runs should be able to read it. </p>

            <p> We are asked to solve the doubt in favor of the proposition that these amendments
              are now before us, and that this provision was directory and not mandatory; and I
              heard a strange statement fall from the lips of the learned Senator from Wayne (Mr.
              Foulke) when he said it was the province of a wise Judge to extend his jurisdiction.
              It has always been the province of a tyrant to extend his jurisdiction, and it has
              always been a fight of the people to prevent that son of thing from the days of
              Runnymede down to this time; and for a man, I know to be familiar with the legal as
              well as with the general history of the country, It was somewhat shocking; to my mind.
              And I heard the Senator from Henry [Mr. Bundy] say if there was a doubt we ought to
              solve the doubt in favor of the proposed amendments and the regularity of the
              proceedings. These gentlemen have read the books too much not to know that is not the
              rule to apply here. That is a rule to apply to Courts when it comes to construe
              statutes, And where if the statute is not clearly unconstitutional the Court will not
              hold it unconstitutional. Why is that? But when we come to pass upon these amendments,
              whether or not the Constitution has been complied with, we are bound by legal rules to
              solve the doubt the other way, and if there be any doubt about the regularity of the
              proceedings, the rule is we should solve the doubt against it. I am not making the
              bare statement as other Senators did, without authority, I will read again from
              Cooley, page 66 The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Smith] said let us throw aside our
              convictions a little while, and solve the doubt that way. I will not be found throwing
              aside my convictions. [Mr. B. reads.] It is the duty of every Senator, if he has the
              least doubt, to solve it as against the proceeding and favor those who uphold the
              Constitution which he has sworn to support. It has become common to sneer at some of
              the gravest things-Constitutional things. During and since the War they were swept out
              of the way with a sneer by the Republicans, and under the guise of the law of
              necessity, many Constitutional provisions; laws were violated, and we have learned to
              disregard those solemn Constitutional limitations, i by the enforcement of which only
              ' can human liberty and Constitutional freedom too be preserved.! I haven't much
              patience with it. Let me call your attention to what this author says about the danger
              of this kind of construction. I will devote myself a little while to some legal
              propositions and then attempt to pay my respects to some other positions taken by
              gentlemen on the other side. [Mr. B. Reads] I commend these words of sound sense to
              members of the Committee. The Senator from Wayne, [Mr. Foulke] gave us several
              illustrations I which to my mind are just as fallacious. He said I we Constitution
              provides in an amendment recently adopted that the Legislature shall enact a law
              providing for registration. Had he looked into the authorities he would see that the
              language used is directory. That it should not be disregarded is patent and plain.</p>

            <p>The Senator from Henry [Mr. Bundy] and the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke] said it
              was sufficient if the essential requirements of the Constitution had been complied
              with. Who is to determine that? The Constitution says these amendments shall be
              entered-spread upon the journals-with the yeas and nays thereon. Is it for the Senator
              from Wayne or Henry or Madison to say what is essential or what is not? Why can't you
              dispense spreading the yeas and nays on the journals? By what authority does the
              Senator from Wayne say, one is essential and the other is not? He says if is more
              important, the Legislature shall agree to the amendments than that they shall nave
              been entered on the journals. I don't know upon what meat he feeds that he can stand
              up here and say what is more or less important in a Constitutional requirement. I know
              no rule by which I am to determine whether the one is more or less important than the
              other. It is enough for me to know that I find the provision there. The Senator from
              Wayne says you can take the journals and the enrolled resolution and find the proposed
              amendment was and is; and he went so far as to say you might resort to secondary
              evidence. I must differ with the Senator there. He said that if a leaf had bee a torn
              from the journals you could resort to secondary evidence. That may be true; but let us
              suppose the primary evidence was gone-that it never had been entered there. It does
              not follow you can go to secondary evidence If that be true, you can call some man in
              who kepi tally with its pencil and marked who voted for and against the measure, is
              the logic of the argument of the Senator from Wayne. I say you can do no such thing.
              The Constitution has provided the kind of evidence that will establish the fact that
              an amendment was proposed in the preceding Legislature, If it can not be found in the
              journals, you have no right to go elsewhere. If you go elsewhere, you may introduce
              parole evidence; you can't determine where to stop if you leave the moorings of the
              Constitution. Let us look at the reason for requiring these things to be entered on
              the journals. Attention has been called very fully to that feature, that the
              amendments to the Constitution need not be proposed even by joint resolutions. As a
              matter of fact, two that are said to be pending now were proposed by concurrent
              resolution. There is no method of authenticating concurrent resolution, unless it be
              entered upon the journals. There has some stress been laid upon the fact that joint,
              resolutions are authenticated by the signatures of the presiding officers of the two
              Houses. Only one of them I believe, is a joint resolution. The other two are
              concurrent, and there can be no doubt but that the framers of the Constitution
              intended that these proposed amendments should be spread at length upon the journals,
              in order that they might be thus preserved: not only that the succeeding General
              Assembly might know just what had passed, but that the people themselves might know
              the exact tones of the proposed amendments. The law provided before the passage of the
              present Constitution, as it provides now, tor the publication of the journals and the
              deposit of a certain number of them in each County, so that such amendments as were
              entered on the journals could be brought to the notice of <pb n="124"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-123"/> the people themselves. It was not intended that the people
              should resort to the office of the Secretary of State to ascertain what was contained
              in proposed amendments. A list of authorities were noted on the other side in a vain
              attempt to answer the argument of the Senator from Marion [Mr Van Vorhis.] Three
              classes have been introduced-one class relating to The question of construction
              merely; another class relating to the distinction in the provision of the Constitution
              relative to titles of acts. The title is no part of an act. And another class relating
              to the authentication of bills. Our Constitution provides that bills are to be
              authenticated by the signatures of the presiding officers; and that alone our Courts
              might well hold is sufficient. That is as far as the Courts should or would go to look
              as to whether a bill is genuine or not. The ayes and nays in the passage of a bill are
              not required to be spread upon the journals. They are required to by called in certain
              cases, but not to be spread at length upon the journals. In Kansas it should be
              observed there were two methods of identification provided for by the the Kansas
              Constitution. The Court might well hold there is one method had been pursued that was
              sufficient; the other need not be. In our Constitution we have no method prescribed
              except the one under discussion; namely; that the Amendments shall be spread upon the
              records of each House. The people must authenticate it themselves. Senators say a mere
              clerk of the Legislature might defeat the will of the people. No, sir. Can the stream
              rise above the fountain? Whose journal is it? Is it the Clerk's journal or the journal
              of the Assembly? It is our journal. It is unfair to attempt to throw this
              responsibility upon our clerks. For us to say that a clerk can defeat our will or the
              will of the people by failing to make up a journal correctly, is to say that it is not
              our Journal but the Clerk's journal. We are contending for the application of a rule
              which will place it out of the power of a clerk to defeat the will of the people. We
              do not read our record every morning. We ought to have it read in our hearing every
              morning, or else the Committee, to which has been delegated that authority, ought to
              learn what is in it and see that it records all that takes place.</p>

            <p> The changing of a word might change the whole meaning of a Constitutional amendment,
              therefore the framers of the Constitution provided that these proposed amendments
              should be entered on the journals of the two Houses-I believe at large. We all know a
              mere concurrent resolution might be substituted-another one for the one that passed. I
              submit to the Senator from Clinton [Mr. Marvin] that if the Constitution requires
              proposed amendments thereto shall be entered upon the journals of the two Houses and
              it has not been done since the Constitutional provision has not been complied with I
              want, him to say to me how he can, in view of these facts, vote for the minority
              report. </p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN: I am not a lawyer. The Constitution does not use the word "spread," it is
              the word "entered." Now the number of the House resolution, No. 7, with the yeas and
              nays on its passage are entered on the Journals. I know I voted on the resolution,
              but, by neglect, careless or intentional of the clerks of the Senate, it is not there,
              but I don't intend that shall deprive me and my constituents of the right to vote on
              those amendments.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL: Then the Senator is going to take the bit in his mouth?</p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN: Yes. sir, I am. [Laughter ]</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL: That may be satisfactory to the Senator, but not to me.</p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN: It is between my conscience, my God and myself.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL (resuming): Then my friend wants this amendment to pass this way improperly
              passed. Everyone honestly desiring such amendments in the Constitution ought to want
              to have it done so regularly and so properly that there can be no mistake about if. I
              want to make a prediction. I predict if this thing goes on in its present shape, be
              agreed to by the General Assembly, be submitted and be ratified by a majority of the
              people, then the Senator will find it will be overturned by any honest Court which
              comes to pass upon it. Then we will be without any amendments or any law at all
              regulating the liquor traffic. I ask the Senator to make a mark there. </p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN (interposing): Then I want the responsibility to lie where it should.</p>

            <p> Mr. BELL; (resuming): That won't answer. I don't see how the Senator can justify his
              conscience and his reputation for sincerity that way. That will be a poor excuse. It
              will hardly compensate for the injury that will follow. If the Senator wanes to
              engraft a prohibitory amendment upon the Constitution he ought to do it regularity.
              One or two years should not be of much consequence, if he is in earnest. </p>

            <p>Much has been said about the right of the people to vote upon this question-about
              submission. I have heard some the other side some talk about the right of the people
              to have this thing submitted. They might as well resolve mat they are in favor of
              having four and four added together to make eight. Everybody is in favor of
              submission. Everybody has to be. The Constitution provides for submission, but it
              provides that certain things shall first be done before submission. Of course any one
              who is loyal to the Constitution after an amendment shall be properly presented,
              properly agreed to, properly entered on the records and properly referred to the next
              General Assembly, and by that body agreed to and submitted to the people for their
              ratification or rejection, then it follows as night follows day that there shall be
              submission. I want to know of some of our Democratic friends who have been
              contemplating voting for submission, if the don"t have to agree to amendments first.
              How can they justify their consciences? Agreement comes first. It is our duty to
              submit amendments after they are agreed to; but unless agreed to there can be no such
              thing as submission.</p>

            <p> A good deal has been said about what is Democratic upon this subject. I want to call
              attention of Democrats briefly to the history of this subject. Let us go back more
              than a quarter of a century in political history and see the position the Democratic
              party held then. [Mr. B. read from the Democratic platforms adopted in 1856, 1866,
              1868, 1870, 1874, 1876, and 1882] That is what the Democratic doctrine has been and
              what Democratic doctrine is.</p>

            <p> I forgot to mention one thing-the position the Senator from Wayne took, that if any
              of these amendments were joint resolutions they were properly before us, but if
              concurrent resolutions they are not. Oh, most lame and impotent conclusion! One is a
              joint resolution-all the rest are concurrent.</p>

            <p> There is another matter that escaped my memory. That is, when the present amendment
              proposition clause was offered in the Constitutional Convention originally, it
              provided that all proposed amendments to the Constitution should be published for a
              given length of time in the newspapers of the State, and this provision proposed by
              Robert Dale Owen substituted the entering upon the journals of the two Houses in lieu
              of the pending provision for publication in the newspapers, showing conclusively that
              by the substitution of the one for the other that it was the purpose and intent of the
              framers of the Constitution, by causing these propositions to amend the Constitution
              to be entered on the journals-to be spread upon the journals-to thereby provide a
              means of publication to the people to inform them of the nature and character of the
              pending amendments. That is another light which will aid us in the construction of
              this clause. </p>

            <pb n="125" xml:id="VAA8558-21-124"/>

            <p>We have witnessed some strange sights in the discussion f this question. The Senator
              from Rush [Mr. Spann] made a dangerous argument in support of the view that these
              amendments are now pending, and especially the position in which the Senator put
              himself He could not be provoked into saying upon the floor of the Senate what,
              opinion he entertained upon this subject. </p>

            <p>The Senator from Wabash [Mr. Sayre] is honest, but he don't understand the tricky of
              the heathen Chinee. [Laughter], I say to him that his own party will help to vote
              these amendments down. The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Smith] won't dare, I think, get
              up and say that he favors prohibition. If he did say it I know enough about his
              constituency to venture the assertion that there are not two Republicans out of ten of
              them who favor prohibition as a matter of principle.</p>

            <p>I am a true temperance man, and I am not ashamed of any of my positions upon the
              subject; but for one, in some respects, I am ashamed of my own political organization
              upon this question. In my humble judgment had the Democratic party taken a position in
              accordance with its teachings and traditions at the beginning of the campaign, which
              it finally took before the election, in my judgment the party would have Carried
              Indiana by over 25,000 majority. There is no need of this political cowardice. It
              finds no place in my composition-I don't like it amongst my friends or foes. The
              Democratic party, grand as it is, true as it is and has been to the principles of
              liberty and human rights has occasionally been led away from its mooring to worship
              false gods, aid every time its curses have returned to damn us. We will not retain the
              fruits of our success unless we cut from principle boldly and without cowardice. I
              would like to read what Cooley says about allowing popular influence to control. </p>

            <p>I am opposed to this amendment in all its stages. I am opposed to it, as I am opposed
              to all sumptuary legislation. I don't believe it is within the province of a
              government to to regulate what a man shall eat, what he shall drink or wherewithal he
              shall be clothed. I don't believe men can be made good by legislation. If they could I
              would draft a bill this way: Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State or
              Indiana, That all men shall be good, true and virtuous, and we would have done with
              all law. But you can't make people good by legislation. No law can be enforced that is
              not backed up and indorsed by public opinion. We have now a temperance law fifty years
              in advance of us, and it was passed by a Democratic General Assembly. The Democratic
              party is the only party which has ever put on the statute books enactments which were
              really in advance on the temperance question. They have all come from and through the
              Democratic party. And if you will enforce our present law upon the subject of the
              liquor traffic you will have taken a step fifty years in advance in the way of
              temperance. There will be no drunkenness if the present law is enforced. It prohibits
              the selling of intoxicating liquors to an intoxicated person or to a person in the
              habit of becoming intoxicated. It prohibits the selling to minors. But it is not
              enforced. Our temperance law is not enforced anywhere in this country. And why is it
              not enforced? Because public sentiment has not backed it up and enforced it. Enforce
              the law you have and you will take a long step in advance. And these temperance
              politicians want to put in the Constitution one that will have still less popular
              indorsement. It would make frauds of our people-they will simply evade the law. All
              human experience has taught this. I don't mean that I am not in favor of astringent
              law in reference to intoxicating liquors I think drunkenness is a crime that ought to
              be punished. I think we must take humanity as we find it. The Senator from Jackson
              [Mr. Brown] the other day described what would be the method of obtaining drinks under
              this proposed prohibitory amendment. I was amused at bis recital, but wondered that
              the Senator did not refer to the number of Government saloon keepers this amendment
              would provide for. You would find it would be more profitable to be a Government
              saloon keeper than to be the owner of a National Bank. This amendment would not
              prohibit, it would put the liquor traffic into the hands of a favored few. This thing
              is a mere sentiment. If the people want to prohibit this is not the kind of an
              amendment that will do it.</p>

            <p>These are a few of my reasons for opposing this scheme. I am sincere in this, and the
              great body of my party, I believe, are sincere. Some of them have been led away by
              this fallacy and fraud. It is cheating ourselves to talk about submission in the
              abstract, because it comes after agreement; it must come after agreement and in no
              other way. I am in favor of killing this thing at the start. Killing it not scotching
              it. I am opposed to it in all its shapes and forms. Our Republican friends would like
              to see this matter defeated by us. They would like, if it is not defeated, to have the
              proposition for submission at a general election defeated, and then not have the
              amendments come before the people at all. Why, the Senator from Rush [Mr. Spann] I
              believe he would consent to most anything.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN (interrupting): I am in favor of anything to beat the Democratic party.
              [Laughter ] </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL (resuming): That's it. That is the size of it. It is simply a ruse-an
              attempt to get political advantage. They know it is a fraud, a delusion and a snare.
              And if my friend thought there was any danger of the prohibition amendment passing
              there is no man who would work harder to defeat it than he. I venture the assertion
              there are not six Republican Senators who will rise and say they are in favor of
              prohibition as an abstract proposition. I doubt if there are three. They don't favor
              it as a party or as a principle. They want to mislead somebody. It is not everything
              the people have a right to have submitted to them, they haven't said so in the
              Constitution. They have said certain propositions receiving the agreement of two
              succeeding General Assemblies shall be submitted for their ratification or rejection,
              I don't think everything should be submitted. Suppose I were to propose an amendment
              that some bright morning all property should be divided up equally. I think that would
              be popular. I believe I would be in favor of that proposition, for I would come out
              ahead. I think that amendment would be carried. But who would say such an amendment
              should be submitted? Or that we would have the right to submit ii? That is an extreme
              case, but putting an extreme case illustrates a principle. So I say about this
              amendment. It involves a principle that is odious and repugnant to our form of
              government, and to all the teachings of the Democratic party. I was opposed to it two
              years ago, and I am opposed to it now; I am opposed to it in all its stages. And the
              people now are opposed to it. You mark that now. The party that couples itself with
              this amendment is going to defeat as it ought to. </p>

            <p>The Senator from Madison [ Mr. Henry] says we want the Dutch vote. If he means the
              German liberal vote, I want to say, yes, we do want it. We want the vote of every man
              who believe in individual freedom and justice, and I don't care whether he be German,
              Irish, Swede, or of what nationality, we need him in the ranks of the Democratic
              party, and expect to so conduct ourselves as to keep him there. </p>

            <p> Coming back to the discussion of the amendment before us, I submit that the
              Constitution has provided all the means and the only means by which it can be amended.
              Those means have not been complied with in this case, and until they are we have no
              jurisdiction over this <pb n="126" xml:id="VAA8558-21-125"/> question. There are many
              phases of this question I have not spoken of. But we have no jurisdiction of this
              question; whatever it is not properly before us, and the right thing to do is to say
              so in so many words Whatever my opinion might be I think, as a legal proposition, if
              we undertake to exercise jurisdiction in this case we shall do violence to the
              Constitution and the oaths we have taken to support it. If this question were divested
              of politics there would be no two opinions among lawyers or honest men. The English
              language is plain. It has been used in the Constitutional provision. It means
              amendments proposed to the Constitution shall be adopted in a certain way or not at
              all. There is no use to attempt to deceive ourselves or be trying to get around it. I
              hope the majority report will be adopted. </p>

            <p>The majority report was concurred in upon a division-affirmative 23: negative, 21. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. BELL the Committee rose and through its Chairman reported this
              action to the Senate. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN moved that the Senate concur in the report of the <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName>.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas, 25; nays, 23, as follows: </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD, when his name was called, said: Upon this question I am paired with the
              Senator from Noble [Mr. Hostetter.] I don't know how he would vote upon this purely
              legal question, but judging from his request I suppose it is my duty to refrain from
              voting, which I do.</p>

            <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded. So the Senate concurred in the report
              of the majority of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and lay that motion on the table. </p>

            <p>Mr. GORDON moved that the House now go into a <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName> for the further consideration of the several reports from the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> in regard to the pending Constitutional
              amendments.</p>

            <p>The motion was carried, and Mr. Jewett took the chair.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, said: Being the author of the resolution which resulted in
              the several reports from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, now before us for
              consideration, I will not enter upon as elaborate a review of the subject, as I had
              intended, for the reason that so many members have and will take part in the debate
              that each of the points will be fully presented and thoroughly canvassed, and my
              attempting to touch them all would be trespassing upon the good nature of the House.
              Prior to the close of the polls last November, I was the candidate of a political
              party and its representative. When the result of that election was declared, I became
              the representative, not of one political party or of the other, but the Representative
              of the whole people of my District in the General Assembly. In my obligation to
              support the Constitution, that obligation included every article and section thereof.
              There was no mental reservation in that obligation in the case of Article 16 of the
              instrument in question. This instrument is no mere temporary agreement entered into
              to-day to be revoked to morrow. It is ordained by the voice of the people, and the
              voice of the people is the voice of God. My County has 6,000 voters. I received a
              petition praying for the submission of the amendments signed by less than 100 voters.
              I personally know these men who signed it. They are honest, law-abiding citizens. Many
              of my personal friends, who would scorn to do a wrong thing, and had they understood
              that they, by signing that paper, were asking me to forget my oath and commit moral
              perjury, they would under no circumstances have signed it. Understand me, I do not
              mean to say that other gentlemen who see fit to vote for the Jewett or Frazer report
              will commit perjury, but I do say it would be perjury for me to do so, for the reason
              that I believe in doing so I would not be supporting the Constitution. </p>

            <p>If I could I would like to vote for submission. If the prohibition amendment was in
              proper condition to be submitted I would be glad to submit It. Mr. Williams continued
              at some length.</p>

            <p>Mr SHIVELY said: If I should have consulted my physical condition to-day I am sure I
              would have remained silent. I take it, Mr. Chairman, that th subject for discussion is
              a narrow one-a plain one indeed. The whole question hinges upon the construction we
              pine upon twelve words in the Constitution. Gentlemen have contended here that these
              amendments are invalid because of the failure of the Clerk two years ago to enter them
              upon the journal. The gentleman from Marion (Mr. Bynam) held that the word "enter"
              meant but one thing and that was that they should be entered in full. I have
              endeavored in the little time I have given to this subject to find, if I could, what
              is the legal definition of the word 'enter." [Mr. Shively here read legal authority,
              showing that the word had a double signification, and that it did not necessarily mean
              to spread at large.] Gentlemen have referred to the Iowa decision. It has been
              referred to often by almost every member on the opposite side of this House. But I
              undertake to say that the Constitution itself settles this question, and let us not go
              abroad for light upon it, [Here Mr. Shiveley read certain portions of the
              Constitution.] When the framers of the Constitution meant that anything should be
              entered at large, they said so, leaving no room for doubt. I undertake to say that
              this reading puts at rest forever the rightful construction of this language. If they
              meant it should be spread at large, why did they not say so? Gentlemen have spoken of
              the wisdom and learning of the Constitutional framers and I join with them in such
              praise. I undertake to say that they understood the meaning of the word "entry," and
              that when they meant it should be entered at large they carefully expressed it so I
              would call attention to the decision of the Supreme Court of Kansas, and the gentlemen
              on the other side have been very quiet about that decision. [Mr. Shiveley spoke at
              some length, citing authorities, etc.</p>

            <p>Mr. PRICE said: I desire to make a few remarks to show plainly to the legal voters of
              my County why I vote as I shall on the reports under consideration. The Constitution
              should be supreme and above every party tie. The members on the other side of the
              House come pledged by their State platform to agree to the amendments <pb n="127"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-126"/> and submit them to the electors of the State at a special
              election I would not do the friends of the amendments the injustice of voting to
              submit said amendments to the people, believing that if ratified by the people the
              Supreme Court would have to declare them null and void, 'and thereby leave us in a
              similar condition like Iowa. The main question is Are these amendments before this
              body strictly in accord with the provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution
              shall be my guide in voting in the reports now pending. The people, so far as I am
              informed, do not desire to have the amendments submitted to them if there Is any doubt
              of the legality of their condition.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Kosciusko, said: I do not believe that the framers of the Constitution
              used words of doubtful meaning. I believe that when they made that fifteenth article
              of the Constitution they studied every word that entered into it. It has been claimed
              here by gentlemen this afternoon that this is simply a political question, and that
              prohibition is a child of Republican birth, and that It has not off its swaddling
              clothes. But I want them to show me n full-grown man of Democratic origin. They chum
              the consistent position upon this proposition. It is said that consistency is a jewel,
              but I do not admit that it is a jewel in this instance. The Republican party never
              crosses a stream until it comes to it. But we find the Democratic party now
              constructing pontoons to cross a silt-lip, before it has crime to it. In reference to
              the Wabash and Erie Canal amendment the gentleman from Knox (Mr Williams) said it was
              all right though it was not Constitutionally passed, simply because the people
              indorsed it. What kind of logic is that? The gentleman on the other side know that if
              they submit these amendments they will lose one faction of their party, and if they do
              not submit them they will lose another faction. </p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON said: In the outset I had decided not to say a word. I admit that some
              gentlemen have made very able arguments on this question, arguments that would have
              sounded very well before a Court. I have said to myself what a benighted body this
              Legislature would have be without any Constitutional lawyer in it. In my opinion a
              model Legislature would be a Legislature without a lawyer in it. I acknowledge that
              there have been very able discussions on both sides of this question. The only
              question before us is whether this provision of the Constitution is mandatory or
              directory. You roust go back then to the decisions of the Court to see for yourself
              whether or not this question is mandatory or directory. Is it strange mat these
              gentlemen who have registered their oath in heaven are all men that are against the
              legality of the Constitutional amendments? In my opinion if there had been no Iowa
              decision, there would have been no reference of this matter to the <orgName>Judiciary
                Committee</orgName>, and we would have adjourned without knowing that we have here
              many Constitutional lawyers I am sorry that the gentlemen who just preceded me (Mr.
              Wilson, of Kosciusko) got a little tinge of politics in his arguments. I am sorry that
              he took that course I am a Democrat from principle. I am against prohibition from
              principle; but it required quite a trial in my mind whether I would decide for
              principle or for suffering humanity. Is it not better of this body should err at all
              that it should be on the side of suffering humanity? </p>

            <p>I have always been taught that if you could find me a case, as a precedent in your
              own State, it was worth a dozen in any other. I believe that if it had been a
              convenient resolution it would have been necessary to have spread it at large upon the
              journals, because a concurrent resolution is not signed by the presiding officers of
              the two Houses. The amendment to the Constitution passed two years ago was a joint
              resolution. It was signed by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House,
              and filed in the office of the Secretary of State, when that was done it was all that
              was necessary to bring it before this House. The Supreme Court of Indiana decided that
              if the amendments are signed by the Speaker of the House and the President of the
              Senate the Court does not examine the record to see whether or not all the steps were
              taken. The gentlemen on the opposite side of this question avoid this decision. They
              go to Iowa for a decision, and that not a unanimous decision. They also avoid the
              Kansas decision which in my judgment is the best of all. </p>

            <p>MR. SUTTON-I regard the question now before the House of sufficient importance to
              command its most serious consideration. We are to decide by our votes a simple
              proposition, and yet, notwithstanding, it is in itself unpretentious, it involves
              principle which confers upon it such weight and seriousness that to ascertain the
              right and maintain it when found, demands the exercise of qualities of head and heart,
              which vitalize conscience, strengthen judgment, adorn the representative and extort
              approval.</p>

            <p> Fortunately the question now before the House is, in so far as the Constitution is
              concerned, placed above partisanism. The Constitution knows no party-under its broad
              shield all parties find protection. The real question before the House is, Shall the
              Constitution be obeyed? </p>

            <p> Sir, It is the Constitution that brings us here; it is that instrument that clothes
              this body with power to enact and repeal laws. We are in our representative capacity
              creatures of the Constitution, nor can any voice be heard in this hall, nor any vote
              be recorded upon any matter within the entire range of legislation, until the
              representative has taken an oath to obey the Constitution, I for one am glad that it
              provides for its own defense. It is the fundamental law, the foundation upon which the
              Governmental superstructure is built. It is a Constution of the people, by the people
              and for the people. Like all Constitution, it has one grand purpose in view,
              stability. Conscitutions are wisely conservative: as a general proposition, they are
              the result of research, of patient though, cool deliberation, and compromise. They
              state fundamental truths, map out lines of policy within which the people who live
              under them and are protected by them may exercise all their inalienable rights,
              maintain their independence and urge forward all their enterprises of progress and
              prosperity.</p>

            <p> Constitutions wisely provide for their own amendments or abrogation. If a new
              Constitution is to be framed the old Constitution distinctly declares what shall be </p>

            <p> To amend a Constitution is, to all intents and purposes, to the extent that the
              amendment adds to or takes from the instrument, making a new Constitution-creating a
              fundamental law upon which other laws of indefinite sweep, for good or evil, may be
              based. Admitting this proposition, and I challenge contradiction, what is the position
              of the amendments upon which the last Legislature deliberated?</p>

            <p>For myself I have no desire to evade the question nor belittle its serious
              significance. I am not unmindful that it has awakened widespread concern and that
              gentlemen of accredited erudition have arrived at antagonistic conclusions. But it has
              been my business, as a representative of a constituency, loyal to the Constitution, to
              ascertain what it demands when amendments are proposed. Permit me to read so much of
              Section I of Article 16 of the Constitution as bears directly upon the question under
              discussion: "Any amendment or amendments to this Constitution may be proposed in
              either branch of the General Assembly, and if the same shall be agreed to by a
              majority of the members elected to <pb n="128" xml:id="VAA8558-21-127"/> each of the
              two Houses, such shall, with the yeas and nays thereon, be entered on their journals,
              and referred to the General Assembly to be chosen at the next general election."</p>

            <p> Mr. Chairman, it is not my prerogative to arraign the last General Assembly. It may
              have performed its duties as best it could with the ability it possessed, but in so
              far as it dealt the Constitutional amendments upon which it deliberated, and doubtless
              voted, it committed one mistake, provided it was the intention to refer said
              amendments to this-the next General Assembly. It was a sin of omission for which this
              House can furnish no atonement. The Constitution commanded the last General Assembly,
              if it agreed to certain amendments to the Constitution, that it should, "with the yeas
              and nays thereon, be entered on their journals." This was not done. There is no such
              record-no commanding testimony. The journals of the last General Assembly are
              defective. Hearsay-rumor-common report-oral testimony does not answer the
              Constitutional requirement. </p>

            <p>The last General Assembly disregarded the command. The letter and the spirit of the
              Constitution were cloven down together.</p>

            <p> Sir, I am not a student of subterfuge, nor the votary of chicanery. It is no part of
              my duty to obscure the mistakes of the last General Assembly, nor declare by my vote
              that a glaring departure from an explicit mandate of the Constitution is of no
              consequence. I prefer to obey the Constitution, and take all the consequences of
              compliance with its mandatory provisions, Choosing the Constitution for my authority,
              my defense and guide, I have no hesitancy in declaring that the Constitutional
              amendments, which were doubtless acted upon by the last General Assembly, are not
              before this House and can not be Constitutionally brought before this body. Why?
              Because the Constitutional injunction, by virtue of which the amendments could be
              referred to this body, was disregarded. </p>

            <p> I hold that the Constitution can not be unconstitutionally amended. I maintain that
              in such matters the partisan ought to take a back seat, and that patriotism should
              come to the front. Here loyalty to the Constitution should be enthroned. Here the
              great truth that the Constitution is the supreme law, should be recognized in all its
              majesty and power. Here, instead of seeking to dwarf its authority, there should be
              displayed on all sides a purpose to magnify its influence, if this is done, if
              gentleman can be persuaded to listen to the simple declarations of the Constitution,
              there can be little doubt as to results. When the Constitution says certain things
              shall be done, what member of this House will be willing to go upon the record by his
              vote, declaring that they need not be done? </p>

            <p> I am aware that much has been said about giving the people a chance to vote upon the
              amendments. Sir, if I were to indulge in boasting, it should be my chief glory to
              declare that in all things I am one of the people. </p>

            <p>not of corporations nor cabals, money and monopoly, but of the people, and when I
              plead for the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, I am, with whatever ability I
              can command, championing the cause of the people. Strike down the Constitution, weaken
              it in any of its provisions, and you not only mar its symmetry but you dwarf its
              protecting power. All the rights and privileges of the people center in the
              Constitution in standing by the Constitution, entering my earnest protest against any
              infraction of its decrees, I am in the broadest and highest conception of the term.
              the friend of the people. When the people of Indiana learn, as they will learn, that
              the last General Assembly disobeyed the Constitution they will be in no mood to
              approve of such dereliction of duty. The people demand, when their Constitution is
              amended, that it shall be done constitutionally. They want no unconstitutional laws.
              Nor do they demand unconstitutional amendments. While the people of Indiana are a
              matter of fact people they are intelligent, discriminating and conservative. It is no
              compliment to Indiana to intimate, here or elsewhere, that her people rather than
              wait, would prefer to see the Constitution violated. Such a stigma is undeserved.
              Loyalty to the Constitution is one of the resplendent virtues of our people, and
              should this General Assembly, by its vote, defy its power, the people of Indiana, with
              a sterner voice than has hitherto marked their indignation, will rectify the wrong. </p>

            <p> Mr. Chairman, I see in this amendment question but one course to pursue, and I
              felicitate myself, that in deciding to take that course, I am sustained by the
              Constitution, by my convictions and judgment, and I am equally gratified to say that
              the more I have examined the subject the more firmly I am intrenched in the conclusion
              that the amendments which were before the last General Assembly have not been
              Constitutionally referred to this body for future action, and I am persuaded that no
              benefits can accrue to the State by a violation of its fundamental law. I do not
              pretend to be endowed with any special gift of prescience, but to my perceptions only
              embarrassments complications and vexations can result from deliberate violations of
              the Constitutions. Here, in our capacity of law makers, no example </p>

            <p> to law should be tolerated. If this General Assembly shall say by its vote that a
              plain declaration of the Constitution can be set aside, what hope have we that the
              laws which we enact shall be treated with greater respect and reverence? A statute is
              of less consequence than the Constitution. If law makers can ibid an excuse for
              violating the Constitution, which they are sworn to obey, what guarantee remains that
              the people, whose servants we are, will not treat with like disdain the laws we enact? </p>

            <p> There comes to us, sir, on every wind that blows complaints of a growing disregard
              of law. We are told that Judges are corrupt and that Jurors are bribed. I could,
              without drawing largely on my memory, introduce instances of judicial debauchery well
              calculated to humiliate any one possessed of a high sense of honor and faith in the
              capabilities and possibilities of human nature. Nor do these shameful recitals include
              only Courts and Juries-they embrace Legislatures and Congress, and are so terribly
              authenticated that their demoralizing influence is felt far and wide. Is it not well,
              therefore, for this General Assembly to ask wherefore this depravity, this
              far-reaching contamination of the very fountains of public thought? </p>

            <head rend="center">THE ANSWER IS AT HAND.</head>

            <p>Disregard of law, disregard of obligations, treating with contempt Constitutions and
              oaths, seeking to obscure rather than emblazon defects and departures from the
              straight and narrow way of duty, listening to clamor rather than conscience and
              Constitutions, and instead of mending ways doing that which expedites disintegration
              and danger I speak for myself on this floor. I am not opposed to amending the
              Constitution Indiana, though the Constitution as it is, in my opinion, meets all the
              requirements which, wisdom and prudence can demand. But, if it is to be amended, I for
              one stand here to declare that in so far as I can influence action it shall be
              Constitutionally amended. I will strike no blow at any of its requirements and
              commands. My fealty to the Constitution shall not be satisfied by adhering to certain
              provisions, while that as of little or no value other provisions which stand in my
              way. I shall cast no vote designed to obscure the fatal mistakes of the last General
              Assembly. <pb n="129" xml:id="VAA8558-21-128"/> It disregarded the Constitution, and
              by its acts it must stand or fall. I am interested in the record this General Assembly
              shall make, and when the gavel falls for the last time, and this House is dismissed
              from its labors, I hope, whatever else may he said of it, that every page of its
              record may be emblazoned with votes, yea or nay-that above all and over all shall
              testify that it was true to the Constitution. </p>

            <p>Mr. Chairman, In conclusion I plead for thoughtful, prudent, conservative and
              cautious action. Let not sensational and partisan clamor direct our votes. Having
              faith in the Constitution of our State and in the wisdom of those who made it, I can
              not for an instant be led to believe that it is necessary to violate it in order to
              perpetuate its existence. If our opponents have raised a tempest it then becomes our
              duty to direct the storm so that justice may be done To all and the rights of the
              people be preserved and their liberties protected under the Constitution.</p>

            <p>Mr. ANTRIM, was of the opinion that there was no irregularity in the proceedings of
              the last Legislature on the question of the Constitutional amendments. While He
              believed that every article of the Constitution should be strictly complied with, he
              did not think it was necessary to add any provision to the Constitution and then
              insist on compliance therewith. He did not think the word "enter" was a strange one to
              Courts and lawyers, citing examples from the statuses and other sources to show that
              the word didn't necessarily mean to spread at large; that in many cases it would be
              impossible to give the word such an interpretation. </p>

            <p>Mr. STERRITT said: Whatever my personal desire may be regarding any of the amendments
              I deem it my first duty to known avid do what is required of me by the Constitution.
              That the amendments are Constitutional before this Assembly can not be doubted by
              carefully considering the journal of the Fifty-second General Assembly and Article 16
              of the Constitution, and believing that, he should so vote, thus doing his duty under
              the Constitution to his people. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, moved that the Committee rise report progress, and ask leave
              to sit again to morrow at 9 a. m.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to, and accordingly the Committee reported to the House this
              action.</p>

            <p>The report was concurred in.</p>

            <head rend="center">THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.</head>

            <p> Mr. JOHNSON offered a joint resolution, proposing an amendment to Section 1, Article
              16, of the Constitution, as follows: </p>

            <p>"Any amendment or amendments to this may be proposed in either branch of the General
              Assembly, and if the same shall be agreed to by two-thirds of all the members elect to
              each of the two Houses, such proposed amendment or amendments shall, with the yeas and
              nays thereon, be entered and spread at full length on their journals and referred to
              the General Assembly to be chosen at the next general election; and if in the General
              Assembly so next chosen such proposed amendment or amendments shall be agreed to by
              two-thirds of all the members elect to each House, then it shall be the duty of the
              General Assembly to submit such amendment or amendments to the electors of the State
              at the next general election, and if a majority of such electors shall ratify the
              same, such amendment or amendments shall become a part of this Constitution." </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN: Of course we all know that there were some amendments proposed to the
              Constitution before the Legislature two years ago, and that the Senate yesterday
              adopted a report declaring they are not pending before the Senate; but until the House
              of Representatives make some disposition of them they are still awaiting the action of
              the General Assembly; and he made the point of order that no amendments should be
              proposed to the Constitution until the question as to whether any such amendments are
              pending entirely disposed of. He read Section 2, Article 16, of the Constitution. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Do you think we are not to vote upon their final passage
              until others are disposed of? </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN: No. The Constitution says, 'shall not be proposed." That, goes to the
              introduction of the amendments themselves.</p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Under the rule of the Senate this would be the first reading
              of the resolution. It would now go to a Committee, come back, be read the second time,
              and ordered engrossed for a third reading on a subsequent day. </p>

            <p>Mr BUNDY: The point made by the Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown] is that this is not
              in order because there are other proposed, amendments pending.</p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I wish the Senator would withdraw his joint resolution
              without requiring the chair to make a decision on this matter. </p>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON: As there seems to be a doubt, and as the validity of the amendment
              itself may be questionable, I beg leave of the Senate to withdraw the resolution.</p>

            <p> SEVERAL SENATORS: "Consent!" 'Consent!" </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Leave is given. </p>

            <p> The following described bills were introduced, read the first time, and severally
              referred to appropriate Committees, unless otherwise stated: </p>

            <p>By Mr BROWN [S. 179] to amend Section 8 of the act of June 7, 1852, concerning the
              election and duties of the Clerks of Circuit and Supreme <pb n="131"

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">ROADS AND HIGHWAYS.</head>

            <p> Mr. BENZ called up the special order, being his bill [ <ref
                target="#SB_1883_01_04_006">S. 6</ref>] for the election and appointment of
              Supervisors of Highways [see pages 28,78 and 98 pf the Brevier Reports.] The question
              being on a substitution for the bill. [See page 98.]</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD believed there was no piece of legislature enacted by the last
              Legislature that was so execrated as the road law. All parties are untied in Southern
              Indiana in demanding that the system of Road Supervisor shall be repealed and that we
              go back to the old system that the people understood. Senators now desire to tempt us
              with amendments. In Section 8, line 3, of the substitute, no one in exempted from
              working on the road over twenty-one years of age. Every industry is applying here for
              ceded legislation, and with the Senate give relief to all but the farming interest.
              The old law is well settled, has been satisfactory, is construed by the Courts, and
              the and the desire for the old law is universal in Southern Indiana, as compared with
              the new. He trusted all substitutes and amendments will be voted down and the demand
              for the old road law acceded to </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE heard from all parts of his County the clamor give us back the old law.
              The people knew exactly the operations of the old law. Then it is said the Trustees
              are improper persons to take charge of the roads. </p>

            <p>Mr CAMPBELL was satisfied this road bill is of as great importance as any measure
              that will come before the body. He moved a recommittal with instructions to report
              next Monday at 2 o'clock in order to give members time to more fully understand the
              merits of the propositions before the Senate. </p>

            <p>On motion of Mr. VOYLES the motion to recommit was laid on the table. </p>

            <p>Mr. McINTOSH traveled over his two Counties in the late canvass and was satisfied
              there were not in favor of the repeal of the present and the re-enactment of the old
              law. A certain odium attached to every man who had a place in the Legislature when the
              present law was passed. The author says this substitute is very like the old law. If
              it is like the old law let the Senator from Crawford [Mr. Benz] have the credit of it
              and have his bill passed.</p>

            <p>Mr. McCLURE: If he felt instructed on one subject more man another it is to help
              restore the old law for the one working of roads, which has given so much
              satisfaction, and with which they have been so long familiar. Therefore he should vote
              for the bill of the Senator from Crawford [Mr. Benz] on its final passage.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL thought the lack of provision for furnishing money for work during the first
              year of the law more than any other feature brought odium upon it. It has many
              provisions which are improvements over the old law. Under the old law it was almost
              impossible to have good roads in his section. Although funds have been had under the
              new law but one year, there is quite an improvement in the roads in his County. The
              old law was defective in many respects. The substitute will probably do away with the
              particularly objectionable features of the present law. Two years ago he said if it
              were adopted and did not work well he would vote for its amendment when opportunity
              offered, and he was ready to redeem that promise now. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES opposed the eliding substitute. If there be any amendments desired they
              should be made to the original bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. KEISER was not here to make a speech for home consumption. If farmers look to
              their own interests they will spend more on roads than on anything else but their own
              farms. It has been claimed that the cry is universal for the old Supervisor law. While
              there is dissatisfaction with the present law, he had yet to hear the first man who
              wants to go back to the old system under the old law. The people want a law which will
              give better roads than under the old law. He could not see where the great cry arises
              against the pending substitute. It makes some man responsible for the roads of the
              Township. Suppose it does cost a little more to have good roads, they ought to be had.
              Under the old law there certainly must have been a great waste of money. In his County
              every year they were credited with putting $11,000 on the roads. Under the old law
              hundreds of dollars were acredited for taxes and not hour's work done therefor. There
              ought to be a provision in every road law to prevent this. Abuses under the old road
              law have had a great deal to do with its inefficiency. He hoped the substitute [Mr.
              Henry's] would be adopted in place of the original bill and then amended. </p>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGASS cited a, main objection to the present law viz., that the work is not
              well or properly distributed throughout the Township. He objected to a superintendency
              of the roads by the Township Trustee, as proposed in the pending substitution. That
              would interfere with the present gravel road law. He also objected to the power of
              removal by Trustees of Supervisors. On this subject the same objections lie to the
              present law. And there is a demand that the present law be amended or repealed there
              is no <sic>pro-provision</sic> in the present law that requires an equitable
              expenditure f road moneys. The old road law has been satisfactory in the past. He saw
              nothing in the substitute that, would remedy the defects of the present law. He
              favored senate bill <ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_006">No. 6</ref> as introduced.</p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY replied to objections to his substitute. He believed with a few changes it
              is a systematic bill. He knew of no reason why a man above fifty years of age should
              not pay a road tax according to the value of the land owned by him. Under this bill
              the per capita tax and commutation is applied by the Supervisor in his own road
              district; and the bill <ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_006">No. 6</ref> does not provide
              the same things. The two differ in this more than in any other one point. The section
              authorizing removal of Supervisors is a desirable feature.</p>

            <p> Mr. LOCKRIDGE, seeing a lack of understanding of this important matter, moved to
              postpone the further consideration till Monday next at 2 o'clock. </p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to-yeas, 24; nays, 25-the Lieutenant Governor giving the
              casting vote.</p>

            <p>And then came a recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

              <p> EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS. Mr. BUNDY called up a special order, being the
                consideration of the question of confirming or rejecting the appointments of the
                Governor for Superintendent and Trustees of the Benevolent <pb n="132"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-21-131"/> Institutions of the State. [See Brevier Reports,pages
                76, 77, 92 and 93.</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN said, if the Senate should confirm these appointments now, and his bill
                [S. 1] for the reorganization of the Benevolent Institutions pass, of course it
                would render nugatory the official life of the appointees. The regular and sensible
                way is to let these appointees stand until the fate of this bill is seen. If the
                bill should be adopted the conduct of some Senators touching the confirmation of
                these appointments will be modified. </p>

              <p> Mr. BUNDY, while willing to allow reasonable time for the Senate and the
                  <orgName>Committee on Executive Appointments</orgName> to consider this matter,
                was of the opinion that the Senate should not sit and wait for the operation of a
                bill the future of which unknown. While admitting there is no vacancy now, and no
                immediate emergency for the confirmation of these appointments, as a matter of
                courtesy to the Executive officer of the State, there should be some action taken on
                his appointments. If there are any charges against these men, or anything that could
                properly be urged as a reason why they should not be confirmed, he would favor
                delaying the confirmation a sufficient length of time to have a full and fair
                investigation, but was opposed to further delay simply to wait action on a bill the
                fate of which is doubtful. These appointments ought to be confirmed by the Senate
                without delay. </p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN moved to recommit the Governor's message to the <orgName>Committee on
                  Executive Appointments</orgName>, with instructions to report at the expiration of
                ten days.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY: Doesn't the time of the present incumbents expire on the first of
                February?</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN: Their term of office expires on the 1st day of February, but there will
                be no vacancy because the law requires incumbents to hold until their successors are
                chosen. He modified his motion so as to require the Committee to report next
                Monday.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY could see no good reason for deferring action on these appointments. He
                favored immediate action. That would not prevent any action on Senate bill No. 1. </p>

          <p> The session was opened with prayer by Representative Frazer, of Rush County. </p>

          <p>The Clerk's minutes of yesterday's proceedings were being read, when-</p>

          <p>On motion of Mr. STEWART, the further reading of the journal was dispensed with. </p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.</head>

            <p>On motion of Mr. HEFFREN, the House resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName>, Mr. Jewett in the Chair, for the further consideration of the
              proposed Constitutional amendments.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, thought that the members should divert themselves of party
              prejudices, and approach this question with a judicial turn of mind. Every man who
              entertains any doubt in his mind of the legality of the pending of the amendments must
              give the Constitution the benefit of the doubt. Section 1 of Article 16, provides that
              a proposed amendment must be entered upon the journal. It seems as though certain
              members have read the Constitution leaving this section out. This section is to the
              Constitution what Sampson's <unclear reason="faded">ha[?]</unclear> was to his
              strength. Do the words "shall enter" mean you may, if you desire? There is no word in
              the English language, taken in its directory and usual meaning, so imperative as the
              word "shall." When the Constitution says that the yeas and nays shall be entered upon
              the journal, does it mean that you <pb n="133" xml:id="VAA8558-21-132"/>may enter them
              or you may not? If the Constitutions is, as the gentlemen claim, simply directory in
              the case of these amendments, then it is simply directory in the case of keeping a
              journal. This provision is mandatory and you can not get around it. Not even the
              substance of these amendments has been entered upon the journal I say to those
              gentlemen who claim that if the Constitution meant to spread at large it would have
              said so, and that if the Constitution meant to enter in substance it would have said
              so.</p>

            <p> Mr. SHAFFER said: I do not know that I should say anything on this question which is
              now before you. You have had this question discussed by some of the distinguished
              lawyers of this State and they have confined themselves very closely to the
              Constitution. Now, gentlemen, I am no lawyer, but I want to present the ideas I
              entertain on this question. I say to you, gentlemen, that when I made my canvass I was
              opposed to prohibition, but in favor of submission at a special election, which I
              believe is right and proper. I will so record my vote. I am a Democrat and have been a
              Democrat for fifty years. I do hope that they will give the people the amendments and
              let them pass their judgment upon them. I believe that the course that some Democrats
              in the Senate and some Democrats in the House are pursuing will defeat them two years
              from now. The great proportion of the people in my County declare that the amendments
              should be submitted to the people; the ladies especially in the Democratic houses
              desire that they should be submitted. These are the reasons why I, as a Democrat,
              believe that the amendments should be submitted. These amendments were discussed in
              the Legislature two years ago. They have been in the minds of the people for the last
              two years. The people are interested in the amendments and desire to have them passed
              and submitted.</p>

            <p> Mr. DEEM regarded the objection to a considering the Constitutional amendments as
              entirely technical. If they have not been properly referred to this body then all the
              excitement and enthusiasm of the stupendous political struggle of last year was a
              gigantic farce and fraud. The alleged irregularity turns upon the word entered. The
              Clerk of the House made no mistake in this question when he made up the journal of
              last session, and his acts are sustained by a proper interpretation of the English
              language, and are endorsed by established precedent and the highest judicial
              authority. What more would the gentleman demand?</p>

            <p> Mr. DAVIS voted against these proposed Constitutional amendments two years ago,
              believing then, as now, that it was never intended to advance the true interests of
              temperance reform. This question ought not be kept in suspense simply for its
              influence of future campaigns. He desired action on this question now, leaving the
              ultimate decision as to the Constitutionality to the Supreme Court.</p>

            <p> Mr. GORDON said: I regret that Democratic members of the House have seen fit to take
              their position upon the ground, or upon the view that the decision of this question
              will affect the Democratic party. I have not allowed myself to look at the question of
              how it will affect the Democratic party in the future. I have tried to see how it will
              in the near or distant future affect the Constitution. I regret to hear a man say that
              if it requires you to violate your oath, why violate your oath. I am of the opinion
              that these amendments are not now pending before this Assembly. Every report before
              this House agreed to one thing, and what is that? It is that the provisions of the
              Constitution have not been strictly complied with. We are told that these amendments
              are sufficiently identified. Let us see if this is the case. The Constitution says
              that these amendments shall be entered upon the journal. This is for the purpose of
              identification by the next Legislature. Do the enrolled resolutions in the office of
              the Secretary of State prove anything? Are they competent to identify these
              resolutions? I say they are not. They amount to nothing, for the reason that they are
              not the kind of evidence the Constitution requires. If this Legislature may disregard
              one provision of the Constitution, may not another Legislature disregard another
              provision, and so on until no single provision will be of binding force?</p>

            <p> Mr. MELLETT said: It seems to me that any discussion of this question is more in the
              nature of an obituary than anything else. The importance of the question has been
              alluded to by every gentleman who has undertaken to discuss it. It is a well-known
              fact to us all that for two years it has been the question above all others which has
              been talked about by the people of Indiana. It is of vital importance to the people of
              this State-to the people now living in the State and those who are to come after them.
              It is not necessary nor is it right that the merits of these amendments should be
              discussed now. It is simply whether they shall be further submitted to the people,
              from whence they originated, for further action thereon. I am one of the members who
              believe that these amendments are properly pending before this General Assembly for
              action thereon I believe with the gentleman from Clarke [Mr. Gibson] that it is not
              right, that it is not just, to destroy them at the present time. If true, as a
              gentlemen have suggested, that the organic law of any people, of any Nation, should be
              supreme, it ought to be such as could not be changed or torn down upon any mere freak,
              pretext or pretence. But while this is true, it is not less dangerous to disregard the
              fact that the power is given to the people to change this Constitution. The question
              for us now to determine, the question for us to decide in this House, regardless of
              what may have been done anywhere else in regard to the amendments were agreed to and
              adopted under the circumstances under which they were that they were doomed to die. I
              believe that the judgment was passed upon them long before the meeting of this
              Assembly. These amendments are fatally entangled in a party web. Mr. Mellett, after
              some further remarks, yielded the floor to</p>

            <p> Mr. Copeland, who moved that the Committee arise, report progress and ask leave to
              sit again at 2 o'clock.</p>

            <p> The motion was agreed to, and, accordingly, the Chairman [Mr. Jewett] reported as
              the Committee directed, and the report was concurred in by the House.</p>

            <p> Then came a recess until 2 o'clock. </p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT, from the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, introduced the
              general appropriation bill for 1883, 1884, and 1885, which was read the first time and
              passed to the second reading.</p>

            <p> Mr. Smith moved that the House resolve itself into a <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName> for the further consideration of the reports from the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> on the Constitutional amendments.</p>

            <p> The motion was agreed to, and accordingly the House resolved itself into a
                <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>, Mr. Jewett in the Chair.</p>

            <p> Mr. MELLETT resumed the discussion of the question where he left off at the noon
              recess. At the conclusion of Mr. Mellett's remarks-</p>

            <p> Mr. GIBSON moved that the Committee recommend that the House take a vote on the
              adoption of the reports on next Tuesday at 10 a. m.</p>

            <p> The motion was agreed to.</p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH of Tippecanoe, said: I have no desire to set myself right before my
              constituents. I have confidence in them and I am sure that they have confidence in me.
              To speak of the Consti<pb n="134" xml:id="VAA8558-21-133"/>tutionality of the
              Constitutional amendments is a misnomer. Whenever the people pass favorably upon an
              amendment it becomes a part of the Constitution. It has been decided that the people
              in their sovereign power could cure any little irregularity that might be found in the
              various stages that the amendments pass through before their submission to the people.
              It is the province of the Courts to speak the law, and it is the province of the
              Legislature to make laws. I shall stand by the rights of the people to make and frame
              and amend the organic law of the country. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOCK discussed the question from a legal standpoint. It is not a question of
              whether prohibition is right or wrong, nor whether the Republican or Democratic party
              is right or wrong. Any person really in favor of prohibition should not desire the
              question submitted to the people if it can not be done Constitutionally. A great deal
              has been said about what is directory and what is mandatory, but Section 1, Article 16
              of the Constitution points out the particular way in which that instrument may be
              amended. For himself he would say that no amendments to the Constitution are before
              this General Assembly. Were we to pass them and the people ratify them, a decision of
              the Supreme Court would set them aside </p>

            <p>Mr. ADAMS regarded this discussion as having taken a wide range. He held legislative
              construction of such a question to be paramount to any judicial decision on the
              subject. You can tell just as well that amendments were passed two years ago as you
              can tell what las were passed then. No clerical error can or ought to defeat the will
              of the people. </p>

            <p>Mr. WRIGHT believed the contents of the joint resolution proposing amendments to the
              Constitution should be considered, and then did it receive the required vote in the
              General Assembly. The directory or mandatory questions do not come into the
              discussion. To enter upon the journal does not mean spreading at large on the
              journals. If the framers of the Constitution meant enter in full, why did they not say
              "enter at large?" Can any one tell why the legal and executive construction of this
              question should be overthrown? Who dare say such precedents are likely to work harm to
              the people of Indiana? If these amendments are stifled the people will consider it a
              shame. They are fairly before the General Assembly, and he should, so vote. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY insisted we are here to carry out the will of those we represent. The
              people of the State are demanding that this child shall not be stifled in its infancy.
              Will gentlemen, because of a mere technicality, say they shall not have a voice on
              this question? Constitutional and legal questions can not be settled by a strict party
              vote. The people should have the right to say whether these proposed amendments shall
              become a part of the Constitution or not. The one question pending is will we submit
              them or not. When he had concluded-</p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, moved that the Committee rise, report progress and ask leave
              to bit again to morrow morning.</p>

            <p> The motion was agreed to Accordingly-</p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT, Chairman thereof, reported as directed by the <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName>, recommending that the House take a vote on the reports from the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> at 10 o'clock next Tuesday, and That the
                <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName> have leave to sit again to-morrow
              morning.</p>

            <p>The House concurred in the report.</p>

            <p> And then came an adjournment until 10 o'clock to-morrow under the rules. </p>

              up to the State line, any turnpike in this State within two miles, may construct a
              road to connect with the road in the other State. An instance in his own County

            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill passed, and moved to lay the
              motion to reconsider on the table. The latter motion was agreed to by yeas, 28; nays,
              19. </p>

            <p>Pending the roll call- </p>

            <p>Mr SPANN, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said; There is an
              important section in this bill put there by an amendment offered by myself, and
              because of that amendment I had made up my mind to vote for the bill, that amendment
              tailing away a great part of the objectionable features the bill otherwise would have.
              But I voted against my own amendment and that bill because there was placed upon the
              Senate a gag rule [the previous question]. Simply because toe members of the other
              side have the brute force-a majority-they stopped my mouth and that of other Senators
              on this side- And I voted against the bill because I am opposed to having the previous
              question put as a gag to discussion upon any bill, and especially anything that
              affects the people as this bill does. I admire the generosity of the Senior from
              Jackson [Mr. Brown], who sits in his chair and did not move the previous question, but
              that it was left for the Senator from Lawrence [Mr. Willard], who has been made the
              tool of the Senator from Jackson to apply the gag rule and move the previous question.
              I vote "no"</p>

            <p> Mr. WILLARD, when his name was called said: I vote "yea" for the reason that this is
              a political question, and I so give notice to the other side of the House that I am
              the tool of no man, but as a member of the Democratic party on this floor I do not
              propose that when a political question has been agreed upon by the Democratic party to
              stand upon the floor and have the other side waste day after day in discussing measure
              whenever a vote is taken, and for that reason I made the motion for the previous
              question, and I stand by it. I made the same motion four years ago on another bill on
              this question which passed through the other House. I stood by that action then and
              was returned to this Senate by the unanimous vote of my constituents-Democrats,
              Republicans and Greenbackers. I believe that it is a right of the majority upon the
              floor to control its own action without factious opposition from the minority. For
              that reason I vote "yea."</p>

            <p> Mr. YANCEY, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: I am another
              member on this floor sent here by Republicans, Democrats and Greenbackers. The
              reputation of the Democracy proves true-the members of that party are afraid of free
              and open and fair discussion of any question that affects the vital Interests of the
              people of the State. We have bad ample evidence of that fact from. the beginning of
              this session of the General Assembly. The Republicans and Greenbackers were subjects
              of mis<pb n="136" xml:id="VAA8558-21-135"/>placed confidence when they sent the
              Senator from Lawrence [Mr. Williard] here to put a gag rule on the Senate when
              considering laws for the benefit of the State. It is so narrow and it is so unfair in
              every sense. This bill is an invasion of the rights of the people, and it is political
              from beginning to end. It is a means by which to put men in office who, is they had
              just dues, would be banished from the United States. [Laughter,] I vote "no." </p>

            <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>

            <p>So the motion to reconsider was laid on the table. </p>

            <p>Mr. Smith of Jay's bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_089">S. 89</ref>] to amend
              Section 4,501 of the Revised Statutes of 1881, was read the third time. </p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH explained that because there is some doubt about the term of schools, this
              bill is introduced by request, to prevent any litigation. There is no very great

            <p> Mr. HENRY opposed the bill. A teacher unfit, whose license only run a week, might
              complete a term for which employed, though it run a year. If a teacher can not renew
              his license there is no need for his being allowed to complete the term. </p>

            <p>Mr. Ristine's bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_022">S. 22</ref>] to amend Section
              5,097 of the code of 1881, being read the third time. See page 39 of the Brevier
              Reports-</p>

            <p> Mr. RISTINE insisted this act has been a great advantage to Counties. This bill
              proposes to allow a tax of 1 1/2 per cent. for the repair and construction of good
              roads. The present law is a dead letter in many Counties for the want of more
              funds.</p>

            <p> Mr. MARVIN'S constituents objected. Under the present law over $9,000,000 in bonds
              can be issued by County Commissioners. There should be a limit to this thing. He
              opposed putting $20,000 more of this kind of burden on his constituency.</p>

            <p> Mr. GRAHAM also objected to this proposed increase of tax for road construction
              purposes. The roads constructed under the law of 1877 are most of them worn out.
              Unless there be a fund to keep gravel roads in repair there had better be no gravel
              roads at all. One hundred thousand dollars is sufficient for any County to use for
              such a purpose. The curse of to-day in Indiana is special taxes. It makes tax
              outrageous an burdensome. And there is great danger of the Counties being made
              primarily liable for the expense of such improvement. There is no good reason for
              increasing the liabilities of Counties one-half. Another objection is the County
              Commissioners have the right to locate these new roads.</p>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGAS asked careful consideration of this bill. It is justice to limit by per
              centum the right to issue these construction bonds. Hence this bill ought to pass;
              there is justice in the proposition. It is the highest prerogative of people to
              encounter their own real estate in order to secure good road facilities. </p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY also hoped the bill would pass, it being an equitable provision. Two years
              ago there was not a mile of free gravel roads in the County of Madison, while now
              there are roads complete and in process of construction to the amount of $90,000. So
              there can be no more built without an increase of taxation. There is nothing in the
              argument about increasing indebtedness. </p>

            <p> Mr. MAGEE opposed the bill. The result would be some portions have bad, while other
              portions of the County have good roads. Probably no county in the State has better
              material for roads than Cass County. Another bad result would be that in five or six
              years the County finds herself indebted to a large amount, and worn-out roads. As a
              legal proposition the County can be held responsible for these bonds in many
              instances. The plan is not a fair and equitable one. It is better to proceed carefully
              and cautiously in this matter. If the people want gravel roads and have the right kind
              of spirit, they will form corporations and build the said roads under the laws of the
              State. </p>

            <p> Mr. RISTINE replied to objections: The bill requires no County to build a single
              road or to increase its indebtedness. The Courts have already passed upon the main
              features of this law. </p>

            <p>The bill finally passed the Senate by yeas, 31; nays, 12.</p>

            <p>Then came a recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

                1,467 of the code of 1881 being read the third time-</p>

              <p>Mr DUNCAN explained the bill confined changes of venue before Justices to one from
                the Justice and one from the Township. Under the present law in criminal cases as
                many changes may be taken as the parties see fit to swear to, which often becomes a
                means of defense with a view to wear out the prosecution without giving a chance for
                trial.</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN saw no necessity for this bill, understanding there is a decision which
                declares that but one change of venue from a Justice is allowable.</p>

              <p> Mr. FOULKE also favored the bill, but doubted whether it would accomplish the

              <p> T The Senate resumed the consideration of Mr. Voyles' bill [S. 91] to change the
                name of the House of Refuge pending at the adjournment yesterday afternoon, the
                question being on Mr. Voyles'amendment to make as Trustees, Lewis Jordan, Levi
                Barnett and Hamet M. Helms </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN moved to amend the amendment by inserting the name of Finley Bigger, of
                Rush County, in place of Hamet M. Helms for the reason that his gentleman is a
                Democrat pure and undefiled. If we have to accept the inevitable, as we must, he
                desired to see this name inserted. If Democrats displace Republicans he wanted to
                get a good, honest Democrat in at least one position.</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN conceded the gentleman named was worthy and competent, but all have to
                take their chances.</p>

              <p> The amendment to the amendment was rejected by yeas, 22; nays, 25.</p>

              <p> The amendment [Mr. Voyles'] was agreed to by yeas, 26; nays, 19.</p>

              <p> Pending the roll-call-</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote said: The law as
                it now stands gives the Governor of the State the power to appoint these Trustees,
                while this bill leaves that power in the hands of the Governor only when there shall
                be a vacancy after the bill shall have passed and become a law. I shall vote against
                this amendment fixing the three names in the blank, for the reason I can not
                understand, and wish the Senator from Washington, or any other Senator, would tell
                me the reason or necess<pb n="137" xml:id="VAA8558-21-136"/>sity for ousting any
                person or changing the Trustees of that Institution. If there has been any
                inefficiency, incapacity or dishonesty, or any charges made against the Trustees,
                and there is a necessity for a change, let it be stated. This Institution,
                reformatory in character, should have a first place in the hearts of every citizen. </p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN made the point of order that the Senator is not giving reasons
                explanatory of his vote, but discussion the merits of the bill.</p>

              <p>The Presiding officer [Mr. Bundy in the Chair] would not undertake to decide. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN (resuming]: I am trying to explain that I am willing to vote for this
                amendment if the Senator will show me it is not a damnable outrage, or if he will
                show me there is a necessity. I say there is no necessity except a political
                necessity. Therefore, I vote "no."</p>

              <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded. So the names were inserted. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to amend. Apart from its political character, which he deplored,
                the bill contains some excellent provisions. The provisions of the present law
                allowing parents to send their incorrigible children to the House of Refuge is open
                to abuse. One of his amendments proposes to change the bill to the present law,
                making warrants for Trustees' pay paid on the order of the Governor [without casting
                any reflection on the Superintendent, but because the principle is right.] In
                Section 3, line 2, he moved to amend by making the subordinates appointed by the
                Governor on recommendation of the Superintendent, as the present law provides. The
                other amendment adds to Section 11 a proviso, saving commitment from being void for
                want of strict compliance with the form prescribed. The last amendment is to require
                a record to be kept of the boy after discharge, in the words recommended by the
                Trustees of said House of Refuge in their last report. He suggested other
                amendments, but made no motion in reference to these suggestions. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES did not think any of these pro posed amendments were either necessary or
                essential. </p>

              <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Bundy in the Chair] stated the question to be on the
                first amendment the money to be drawn on the warrant of the Governor for pay of
                Trustees. </p>

              <p>Mr, BROWN opposed this first amendment.</p>

              <p>Mr. BELL: The warrant can not be drawn for more than the law allows, and as a
                matter of convenience it should remain as in the bill. </p>

              <p>The first amendment was rejected by yeas, 14; nays 32.</p>

              <p>The second amendment adding the words "not to exceed the number approved by the
                Governor" as in the present law-referring to the number of subordinates-was also
                rejected by yeas, 15; nays, 4.</p>

              <p> The third amendment adding to the eleventh section the words "Provided that no
                commitment shall be void for failure to comply with this provision," was agreed
                to.</p>

              <p>The last amendment, requested by the Board of Trustees, requiring a record of the
                conduct of boys after leaving the Institution to be kept, coming up-</p>

              <p>Mr. BELL thought the less record kept of a boy after he gets out the better it will
                be for the boy in after years.</p>

              <p>Mr. HILLIGASS also thought each a record might come up to plague the boy in after
                life.</p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE withdrew the amendment.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN moved to amend so that this bill shall not take effect till after the
                terms of present Trustees expire. He offered this amendment to learn what was the
                reason of this proposed change </p>

              <p>Mr. BENZ: Because there is a Republican over there, and we want to kick him out.
                [Laughter ] </p>

              <p>Mr SPANN considered this a frank and honest confession. Two of the Democratic
                Trustees' terms expire in November. Why then do Senators want to turn out one of
                their number? Has there been any dishonesty discovered? Why is it? He hoped
                gentlemen would be as frank in answering as the Senator from Crawford [Mr.
                Benz].</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN said this was carrying out a great Democratic principle-rotation in
                office-a short official life for each individual-the public offices to be
                distributed so as to give the largest number of persons official engagement. He
                demanded the previous question.</p>

              <p>The demand was seconded by the Senate-yeas, 27; nays. 15.</p>

              <p>Under the operations of the previous question the amendment was rejected by yeas,
                18; nays, 2[6?]; and the bill was ordered engrossed for the third reacting. </p>

              <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH from the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName> submitted a
                report, setting forth that Wm. L. Rude. of Morganstown, Morgan County, has failed to
                obey a summons issued by said Committee requiring him to appear and testify before
                said Committee in the contested case of Johnson versus Overstreet [the sitting
                Senate ] bringing with him certain papers, in said subpoena specially named;
                wherefore the Committee, upon the consent motion and request of both parties and
                their respective attorney ask that an attachment be ordered to be issued and served
                upon said witness, that his attendance may be enforced and testimony procured by the
                Committee and said papers be produced.</p>

              <p>Mr. BELL said the return shows a personal service, but there is said to be some
                sort of an excuse for the witness not appearing. The Committee propose to instruct
                the Doorkeeper if certain, papers be in the witness' hand and are produced and there
                be a real necessity for the witness to remain away, to so permit. There is no desire

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN moved that the House resolve itself in to a <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName> on the state of the Commonwealth, for the further consideration of
              the status of the proposed Constitutional amendments, acted upon by the last General
              Assembly.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to, and accordingly the House resolved itself into a Committee
              (Mr. Jewett in the Chair), the question being on concurrence in the Patten and Jewett
              minority report from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. [See pp. 79, 108,
              113,116,118 of the Brevier report ]</p>

            <p>Mr. BEST thought that in the further discussion of the question before the Committee,
              it would be almost impossible for any member to offer anything new. The ground had
              been fully covered. He entered into a lengthy argument citing <pb n="138"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-137"/> authorities and precedents to show that all the changes
              and amendments to our National and State Constitution have been declared
              unconstitutional by great Constitutional lawyers, but in the end they have had to
              confess that they were in the wrong, and were compelled to acquiesce in the voice of
              The people. Mr. Best cited as example the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth
              amendments to the National Constitution were held to be unconstitutional by many great
              men and a great party, until notified by the people, and since that time they have
              been a part of the Constitution, and no one has questioned the fact The people have
              demanded that these amendments shall be submitted to them, and the Republican party
              has always been willing to allow the people to speak their voice on this question. No
              gentleman on this floor should allow his Judgment to be biased by any decision of the
              Supreme Court. The framers of the Constitution knew the meaning of the word "enter,"
              and did not use it when they meant "spread at large." </p>

            <p>Mr. HANSON thought that in the discussion of he question much time had been
              unnecessarily consumed in a vain effort to envelop the real issue before the House in
              a tissue of misleading statements calculated to draw the attention from the main
              question. This is not the first time in our brief history when a great party has
              attempted to stifle the voice of the people and prevent their will from crystallising
              into the organic law by the 'stop thief" cry of violating the Constitution. Has any
              one attempted to have any amendment inserted in the Constitution without the
              concurrence of the people at a popular election? I regard the provision that the
              amendments with the yeas and nays shall b^ entered on the Journals as mandatory. It
              means what it says. And I only insist that gentlemen on the opposite side who have
              insisted so strenuously upon a literal construction of the Constitution, shall he
              compelled to swallow the same medicine they hive prescribed for us. Believing, as I
              do, that both the letter and spirit of the Constitution have been complied with, and
              that these amendments are now properly before the General Assembly to be acted on as
              the Constitution requires, I deem it my highest duty as well as pleasure to cast my
              vote in such manner as to carry from these hails to the people, in whose voice and
              will reside the ultimate and exclusive right to create or change the fundamental law
              of our State, the amendment proposed by our last General Assembly to be finally passed
              upon by a popular vote. </p>

            <p>On motion, the Committee arose and reported progress, and asked to sit again: at 2
              o'clock. The report was concurred in by the House. </p>

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN moved that the House now proceed with the business on the Speaker's
              table.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to. </p>

            <p>Senate Joint Resolution No. 1 was taken up, read the first time, and, on motion by
              Mr. Jewett, referred to the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>. </p>

            <p>The bill [S. 1] for a reorganization of the Benevolent Institutions was taken up,
              read the first time and passed to the second reading. </p>


            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS </head>

              <p> On motion, the House resolved itself into <orgName>Committee of the
                  Whole</orgName> [Mr. Jewett in the Chair] for the further consideration of the
                present status of the proposed Constitutional amendments.</p>

              <p>Mr HOWLAND did sot desire to make any lengthy remarks on the question. He thought
                we have had entirely too much said already, and believed that not a vote would, be
                changed if this discussion was to be continued until the end of the session. He
                thought that the framers of the Constitution so constructed it and made it so plain
                that any one could understand its meaning; that the amendments must be entered on
                the journal in full with the yeas and nays thereon, there can be no doubt. Every
                member who voted for that Constitution voted for it with that understanding. He
                believed that it was so construed thirty years ago, and he so construed it now.</p>

              <p> Mr. CAMPBELL had been sitting here as a Juror to decide a case which, in his
                opinion, should not have occupied the time of the House one hour. On the assembling
                of this House every member thereof was furnished a copy of the journal of the
                proceedings of the House of the last General Assembly. In that journal every man can
                find sufficient evidence to satisfy any reasonable man that the House of the last
                General Assembly received petitions from a respectable number of legal voters of the
                State, asking that certain amendments to the Constitution be passed upon by that
                body and submitted to the people; and we can find in that journal, in my mind,
                reasonable evidence that that House, in good faith, complied with the request of the
                people; that the amendments were properly passed by that Legislature, were signed by
                the presiding officers of the two Houses, and were filed in the office of the State
                Librarian and a certified copy of the same filed in the office of the Secretary of
                State, he did not believe any member on the floor doubts. In the fall of these facts
                it is surprising that any member of this House, who was a member of the last General
                Assembly, should oppose the proposition that those amendments are properly before
                this House. Mr Owen, in the Constitutional Convention,said, "We do not propose that
                the organic law shall be in the power, of the Legislature" What are we doing now but
                taking the organic law of the State in our hands? We were sent here with an
                understanding that those amendments were pending, and that we were to vote for or
                against them according to our own sentiment and the sentiment of the people who sent
                us here. </p>

              <p>Mr. KNOWLES had always been in favor of short prayers and short services at
                funerals. He considered the amendments legally before the House for its action
                thereon.</p>

              <p>Mr. HOLLER said: Were I capable of discussing this question from a legal
                standpoint, I should consider it useless to do so at this stage of the discussion. I
                desire that my position upon this important question shall be known. We are to-day
                discussing the legality of a question which, if it was adopted by the Senate and
                this House, would strike down one of the greatest evils existing in our Nation. Sir,
                as Representatives of the citizens of the great State of Indiana, I believe it is
                our duty to support every legal measure that, will have a tendency to elevate our
                fellow-man. For this reason I stand here to-day in favor of submitting these
                amendments to the people. I know that there are many Democrats in the County of St
                Joseph who are desirous that these amendments shall be submitted to the people.</p>

              <p>Mr. PETERS said: The question before this Legislature for the last four days has
                been, are there any Constitutional amendments legally pending before this General
                Assembly for its action thereon? The Senate has already decided that there are no
                such amendments legally before us, and I think it decided wisely. I take it that the
                Constitution means what it says In the section providing for its own amendment. If
                the framers of the Constitution had thought that the entering of the title to
                amendment would be sufficient evidence to identify such amendment after two years
                had passed, they would have said so, or they would not have said that the
                amendments, with the yeas and nays thereon, shall be entered w the journal. We will
                admit for the sake of argument that the word "enter" is susceptible of a definition
                that would admit an amendment by its title, and will gentlemen who hold this view
                turn with me to <pb n="139" xml:id="VAA8558-21-138"/> the journal and see whether or
                not this has been complied with? I take it that if this is the case amendments would
                go through the same course that bills or acts would go through. They would be read
                and numbered and placed on the journal in that manner, and they would be spoken of
                or referred to the Committee by that name and number. If they were amended in any
                way as to affect their title, they would be referred to and placed on the journal by
                their amended title. If gentlemen will examine the House journal they will find that
                House joint resolution No. 7 was amended by striking out certain words in tie title,
                and it, is afterward referred to under the old title so having passed the Senate.
                Now, gentlemen, is this the same resolution that passed the House in the first
                place?</p>

              <p>Mr. THOMAS believed that certain amendments to the Constitution were proposed two
                years ago, and so far as he could see, those proposed amendments were now legally
                pending before this House for its action thereon. He thought that as they were acted
                upon by the last Legislature they necessarily came before this General Assembly for
                its occurrence or rejection. He believed that every man in the State understood that
                the said amendments have been pending for he last year, and he would vote to submit
                the amendments to the people. </p>

              <p>Mr. FLEECE came here to represent the people of Hendricks County, a County in which
                there has not been a saloon for twenty years. He stood pledged to his people and to
                God to vote to submit these amendments. It is every one's duty to keep his pledges.
                No political party has a right to bind the conscience of any man on the question of
                the Constitutional amendments. </p>

              <p>Mr. HENDERSON believed the proposed Constitutional amendments were honestly and
                fairly before this General Assembly. The people not only of this but of other States
                are anxiously awaiting to see what kind of medicine this General Assembly will
                administer and the result of the administration. So far powerful sedatives and
                poisonous doses have been given upon the one side in the way of technicalities and
                formalities, and upon the other side good and wholesome food mingled with the pure
                and sparkling waters that have a tendency to invigorate and make them strong; and
                to-day, though dead in the Senate, we find they still live in the House and have
                power, backed up by the people of the great State of Indiana in their sovereign
                capacity. If the very letter of the Constitution must be complied with, it would cut
                off almost any possible chance for an amendment to the Constitution; therefore a
                liberal construction must be had to carry out the spirit and intention of that
                instrument. If we do not give the people the rights guaranteed to them by that
                Constitution, we take an advanced step toward centralization and revolution, which,
                if not checkmated by the people, may result in the destruction of this, the grandest
                and most noble Republic of all the Nations of the world. </p>

              <p> Mr. McMULLEN said: The discussion of the question before the Committee has taken a
                wide range. He was here to defend the Constitution as it is, which we must all do
                until it is changed. He liked the Constitution because it is the Democratic law of
                this great Commonwealth. Our government is a Democratic-Republic forms neither
                purely Democratic nor purely Republican; but the fundamental law of our State-the
                Constitution-has more Democracy in it than any other, being even endorsed by the
                direct, vote of the people. </p>

              <p>In the Constitution, Article 16. we have the will of the people clearly and fully
                expressed. They have said in no uncertain language what their will is. They have
                said their will is, when the Constitution is to be amended you shall amend it thus
                and so, and by the report which we seek to have this Committee recommend to the
                House for adoption, we say the people will, must and shall be obeyed; that if their
                fundamental law is to be amended, it shall be amended as they direct though the
                heavens fall. When the people sent you here to represent them they sent you here to
                represent them under, by and according to the Constitution. They have said you shall
                amend the Constitution thus and so, and you say they did not mean that we will do it
                another way. In effect you say they did not mean what they said and do that to all
                in the name of the people. No tyrant ever oppressed his people but what he did it in
                the name of liberty. You talk long and loud and cry out for the rights of the people
                and at the same time are trampling under foot the will of the people expressed to
                you by the highest and most sacred way known to a free people, viz. by their written
                Constitutional law. He believed these amendments are not properly before this
                General Assembly, and therefore would vote against their submission. </p>

              <p> Mr. HEFFREN moved that the Committee rise, report progress and ask leave to sit
                again next Tuesday at 10 o'clock. </p>

              <p> The motion was agreed to, and-</p>

              <p> The House concurred in the report of the Committee.</p>

              <p> And then the House adjourned until to-morrow. </p>

            <p>The following described bills were introduced, read the first time and severally
              referred to appropriate Committees, unless otherwise stated:</p>

            <p> By Mr. BUNDY [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_192">S. 192</ref>] to legalize the
              incorporation of the town of Cadiz, in Henry County, and the acts of all officers
              thereof, which was read the first time, and, on his further motion, under a
              dispensation of the Constitutional provision, pressed to its third reading, and passed
              by yeas, 43; nays, 2. </p>

            <p> By Mr. VAN VORHIS [S. 193] to amend Section 1 of the act of January 9, 1852,
              concerning the qualification of Justices-Section 1,418 of the Codes of
              1881-authorizing but three in each Township and one for each incorporated town or city
              in addition thereto. He thought this bill would affect none other than this city and
              this Township. There are now seven or eight or nine Justices and hanger on hunting up
              litigation. This bill simply reduces the number for cities from two to one. The
              present law allows two to each incorporated city. He moved its reference to the
                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> with instructions to report to-morrow on this
              bill.</p>

            <p> The motion was agreed to.</p>

            <p> By Mr. CAMPBELL a bill [S. 194] to amend Section 34 of the Common School law-being
              Section 4,425 of the Revised Statutes of 1881. [Applicants for teachers' license shall
              pay the County Superintendent fifty cents as a County Institute fund.]</p>

            <p> By Mr. BENZ [S. 195] to amend an act authorizing aid to plank, gravel and other
              roads, being Sections 4,045 and 4,053 inclusive of the Revised Statutes of 1881. [Not
              exceeding 2 per centum of taxables, and makes action on the part of the County
              Commissioners peremptory to the extent of ordering an election whenever a petition
              from twenty-five taxpayers is filed with the Board. The bill also provides that

            <p> On motion of Mr. WHITE, his bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_074">S. 74</ref>] to
              authorize any Hydraulic of Manufacturing Company to erect a dam across the St. Joseph
              River, in Elkhart County, was, under a dispensation of the rules, yeas 49, nays 3,
              read the second time by title only, considered as engrossed, read the third time and
              passed by yeas, 46; nays, 1.</p>

            <p> Mr. WHITE, explaining: It is purely a local matter, affecting only the town of
              Elkhart, and its provisions will interfere with no rights, and will not cause any
              overflow of land, and not infringe on the rights of Manufacturing Companies. </p>

            <p> By Mr. BELL [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_196">S. 196</ref>] to amend Sections 9. 38,
              47 and 76 of the act dividing the State into Judicial Circuits, of March 6, 1873.
              [Franklin, Fayette and Union Counties to constitute the Thirty seventh Circuit. It
              also affects Decatur and Rush Counties.]</p>

            <p>By Mr. MAGEE [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_197">S. 197</ref>] to amend the act
              dividing the State into Judicial Circuits of March 6, ' 1878. [Affecting the
              Thirty-ninth Circuit-White and Carroll Counties] He said it was simply adding one week
              to each term of the White County Courts, in favor of which he presented a petition
              signed by attorneys and County officers of White County. He moved to suspend the
              Constitutional rule that the bill be pressed to its final vote now. </p>

            <p>Mr. YOUCHE opposed the motion. The bill ought to be considered by the
                <orgName>Committee on Organization of Courts</orgName>. </p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to yeas, 38; nays, 7. The bill was read the second time by
              title only, considered as engrossed, and being read the third time. </p>

            <pb n="141" xml:id="VAA8558-21-140"/>

            <p>Mr. YOUCHE said: The people should have all Court facilities required, and would not
              oppose this bill did he not fear it would do injustice to surrounding Counties. He
              deprecated the pressing of bills to the final vote as soon as introduced and without
              consideration by a Committee.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE did not think this bill would injuriously affect adjoining Circuits. It is
              intended to give relief to White County. There was a bill prepared and is in
              possession of a Senator to create an additional Circuit out of Starke and Pulaski
              Counties which, together, do not produce fifty cases of litigation annually, in order
              that some Republican have a place on the bench provided for him.</p>

            <p> Mr. YOUCHE: Does not the Senator know that Starke and Pulaski are reliably
              Democratic, by from 500 to 700 majority?</p>

            <p> Mr. MAGEE: Unfortunately, I do not. They sometimes wobble.</p>

            <p> Mr. KEISER knew the County of White needs more time, and the reference of this bill
              to a Committee would not be of any use because it can net be improved.</p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL thought this bill should be considered by a Committee before the final
              vote on it. </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE made an ineffectual motion to postpone this further consideration of this
              bill till 10 o'clock to-morrow. </p>

            <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas, 30; nays, 14.</p>

              <p>Pending the roll call-</p>

              <p> Mr. McINTOSH, when his name was called, said, I would like to explain. Senators
                will remember that about four days after the passage of a resolution authorizing the
                appointment of five additional assistants to the Doorkeeper offered a resolution
                requiring the discharge of all not authorized by law. A great portion, probably
                one-half, of my Democratic colleagues voted to lay my resolution on the table, and
                most of my Republican friends voted with them, and my Democratic friends seemed well
                pleased to have the Republicans vote with them. I thought, and still think that
                fifty Senators require no more Doorkeepers than 100 members in the other House, and
                I have been all the time in favor of going back to the number limited by the
                statutes, and as it seems that can't be done in no other way-a desperate case
                requires desperate means-I vote "aye."</p>

              <p> The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>

              <p> And so the resolution was adopted.</p>

              <p> Mr. DUNCAN moved to reconsider the vote just taken and lay the motion to
                reconsider on the table.</p>

              <p> The latter motion was agreed to by yeas, 24; nays, 23.</p>

              <p> Mr. DUNCAN offered a resolution that Richard Huncheon be declared Doorkeeper of
                the Senate.</p>

              <p> Mr. MARVIN raised the point of order that the resolution is not in order.</p>

              <p> Mr. DUNCAN said the resolution just adopted required a selection now.</p>

              <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the point of order not well taken.</p>

              <p> Mr. MARVIN made the point of order a Doorkeeper can not be elected by a
                resolution.</p>

              <p> Mr. HILLIGASS moved to amend the resolution by substituting the name of Captain
                Charles A. Edmonds, the Assistant Doorkeeper. He said, from the commencement of the
                session, it was understood there has been some objection to the Doorkeeper. Being a
                new member he has known but little of the past customs of the Senate or the employes
                necessary for the body. But action has been taken. We are now without a Doorkeeper,
                and in offering this amendment he came before the Senate representing in that motion
                a worthy man and a soldier a gentleman who comes with an empty sleeve, having lost
                an arm in defense of his country; and he proposed to put the Republican side of the
                Senate on their mettle as to the adoption of the amendment. He demanded the previous
                question.</p>

              <p> The Senate seconded the demand, and under the operation thereof the amendment was
                agreed to by yeas, 25; nays, 21, as follows:</p>

              <p> And so Mr. Edmonds was elected as Doorkeeper of the Senate.</p>

              <p> The resolution, as amended, was adopted without a division.</p>

              <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR requested the Senator from Brown [Mr. Duncan] to step in
                one of the Court rooms and bring in one of the Judges-the first one you can
                find.</p>

              <p> Judge Norton: If the Criminal Court, soon appearing, Mr. Edmonds was sworn into
                office. [Applause.] </p>

              <p>Mr. Foulke offered a concurrent resolution recommending Senators and requesting

              <p> Mr. FOULKE offered a resolution requiring the <orgName>Committee on
                  Elections</orgName> to return the bills <ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_077">S.
                  77</ref>, 82 and 83 concerning registration to-morrow morning.</p>

              <p>Mr. BELL and Mr. SAYRE, members of the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName>,
                protested against the passage of the resolution.</p>

              <p> Mr. FOULKE thought the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName> had so much to do
                these bills had better be returned and considered by another Committee.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN knew of no Committee which has <pb n="142" xml:id="VAA8558-21-141"/> done
                so much work as the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName>, and did not consider

              <head rend="center">FEMALE SUFFRAGE. </head>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE offered a joint resolution [S. -] proposing to Section 2, Article 2, of
                the Constitution an amendment abolishing all Qualification of voters on account of
                sex.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN raised the point of order that while there is an amendment pending either
                before the Legislature or the people the Constitution provides no other proposition
                shall be made. Any member can make a proposition, but not while pending amendments
                are undisposed of.</p>

              <p> Mr. FOULKE referred to the decision of the Senate that there are no Constitutional
                amendments pending, which is res adjudicata as far as this House is concerned.</p>

              <p>Mr. BELL referred to the fact that the Senate composes but one-third in number of
                the General Assembly, and that Constitutional amendments are pending in the other
                branch of the Legislature.</p>

              <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS considered the action of the other House has nothing to do with the
                action of this body in that matter.</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN insisted that it takes the Senate and House of Representatives to
                constitute the General Assembly. He read Article 16, Section 1, of the Constitution,
                then Section 2 of the same article. Then both branches must declare the action of
                the General Assembly. The Constitutional amendments are presumably awaiting the
                action of the General Assembly until both Houses decide otherwise. So long as the
                question of their reference is undisposed of they are awaiting the action of the
                General Assembly. The Senate has adopted a report from the <orgName>Judiciary
                  Committee</orgName> which says these amendments are not awaiting the action of the
                General Assembly. That may be true or not. That report is not binding upon the
                Senate by any means. He was surprised that some of the advocates of those measures
                have not forced the Senate to a vote upon them. They still are here and will be here
                until both branches of the Legislature declare otherwise. </p>

              <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I want to hear the Senator from Madison [Mr. Henry] and
                the Senator from Wabash [Mr. Sayre] on this point.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY was surprised at the position taken by the Senator from Jackson [Mr.
                Brown]. We had the question referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>,
                and that Committee reported that there were no Constitutional amendments pending.
                This Senate agreed to the proposition, and it is settled by the journals of this
                body that there are no amendments pending or referred to this Legislature from the
                last. How are you going to get around it?</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN (interposing): Suppose the House of Representatives should agreed to
                these amendments. If it does they will come here, won't they? And suppose myself and
                four or five other Senators on this side change our minds and vote with you
                gentlemen on the other side (who have been so anxious to agree to them) and carry
                them, would they not be valid?</p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY (resuming): They would not be valid. This Senate has by deliberate
                action, after four days' discussion, solemly said, and it is a matter of record,
                that they are not taken before us; and the Senator from Jackson will not take the
                position that any action of the Senate submitting them to the people would be legal,
                even were they ratified by the people. It is foolish to say the action of the other
                House can affect the action of this House on this question. The point of order is
                not well taken because the Senate has no official notice of what the House has
                done.</p>

              <p> Mr. SAYRE thought the action of the Senate in this matter is final and binding for
                the remainder of the session. Suppose the House of Representatives never make a
                report to the Senate about Constitutional amendments, are we thereby to be precluded
                from taking action on any amendments to the Constitution that may be proposed? The
                point of order, evidentally, is not well taken.</p>

              <p> Mr. FOULKE: According to the position of the Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown] we
                can not submit to the people the present proposed amendments to the Constitution
                because they are not pending before us, and we can not introduce any new amendments
                because the present amendments are pending before us. Those two statements can not
                stand together. The adjudication of the Senate is binding on the Senate during the
                session as to any like matter that may subsequently arise. The majority report of
                the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> says there are no amendments awaiting the
                action of this General Assembly. If that be so, there can be nothing awaiting either
                branch of the Legislature. The decision that there are none before the Senate is
                binding upon the Senate, and if there are none before the Senate there can be none
                before the House. And because there are no other amendments pending, it is proper
                that my resolution should be introduced. According to the doctrine the Senator from
                Jackson advocated upon this floor in the discussion the other day, no amendments are
                pending before either branch. He claimed the defects were fatal, and the Senate so
                decided. If that decision is right I have the right to introduce this resolution. If
                the decision the Senate made the other day is wrong, it is still a law to itself,
                and we have the right to introduce any other amendments.</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN (interposing): Can it be said that the General Assembly of the State of
                Indiana has decided that these amendments are not pending until the House of
                Representatives has concurred with the decision of the Senate?</p>

              <p> Mr. FOULKE (resuming): Possibly not, but it can be said that the Senate has
                decided they are not pending before either House.</p>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I have my mind made up, but I do not want to decide the
                point. If the Senate wants to hear my opinion I will give it. [Several Senators-"Go
                on." "Let us have it."] I think the amendments are pending before the General
                Assembly, and the Constitution says you can not introduce additional amendments, if
                any are pending. You can not introduce these in the House to-day. If you have the
                right to introduce them here you have the right in the House. If the House passes
                them and the Senate agrees, I think they would be before the people. Of course it is
                a question I would rather not decide. I would rather it would go to the
                  <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. I would like for the Senator from Jackson
                to withdraw his point and let it go to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>,
                and let them report to-morrow.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN: If I do that I admit the introduction of this amendment.</p>

              <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The Committee can report it is not proper.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN: The Chair sustains my point of order and I don't like to give up the
                verdict after gaining my case.</p>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I would like the Senator to do it.</p>

              <pb n="143" xml:id="VAA8558-21-142"/>

              <p>Mr. BROWN: I have no objection to referring the point of order to the
                  <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>. </p>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: No, let the resolution go.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN: The resolution would, then be before the Senate. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE, to relieve the embarrassment, asked leave to withdraw the resolution
                for the present.</p>

            <p>Mr. Williams, of Knox, moved that the further consideration of the bill be
              indefinitely postponed, pending which-</p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, was of the opinion that the Grand Jury was one of the grandest
              institutions we have for the protection of public morals; and that the Grand Jury of
              to-day is a great improvement in its modified form over the Grand Jury of former days.
              He felt that if the bill passed it would make it almost impossible to punish certain
              classes of crime, such as disturbing meeting, gambling, etc. Such lawbreakers do not
              desire to go before a Grand Jury, but avoid it whenever possible He believed that
              there would be a rime of chaos and confusion if this grand system was to be broken
              down. </p>

            <p>Mr. MELLETT was not one of those who would underate the work of the Grand Jury. He
              believed that it was a necessity, however much its privileges may have been abused. He
              believed that the Grand Jury now compel feel to lake cognizance of offenses that it
              would be better if it were not compelled to observe. He believed that certain crimes
              and misdemeanors could only be reached in this way. He would deprecate the practice of
              Grand Juries sitting for weeks to examine into old. offenses, perhaps years old. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILEY thought the Grand Jury stood as a great bulwark and a great defense between
              the people and the violators of the law. He was opposed to the provisions of the bill,
              and hoped that the motion to indefinitely postpone would be agreed to. He had received
              a communication from a party living in the County from which the petition was sent
              that accompanies the bill, and he was led to believe that the petition had been
              circulated and sent here in the interest of a class who desired to avoid the law by
              securing the passage of the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON thought that the title of the bill should be made to read a bill to
              protect saloon-keepers and other violators of the laws. He had papers In his
              possession that stated that the petition had been circulated in the interest of the
              saloon-keepers of the County from which the petitions originated. He did not consider
              the abuse of a law sufficient ground for its repeal. He hoped that the bill would be
              indefinitely postponed. </p>

            <p>Mr. STEWART desired that the motion to indefinitely postpone would be agreed to. He
              thought that there was a class of misdemeanors that could only be reached through the
              Grand Jury. He did not believe any man, be he ever so good a citizen and respecter of
              the law, would voluntarily go before a Justice of the Peace, as would be necessary in
              case the bill became a law, and make affidavit against the son of a neighbor for some
              misdemeanor committed by that son. He thought that the jurisdiction of the Grand Jury
              should be left unchanged. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT desired to disclaim any personal interest in the bill, although it had
              been ascribed to him He introduced the bill in the interest of economy and for the
              purpose of protecting citizens from being housed up before the Grand Jury. He would
              say to the gentleman from Benton [Mr. Wiley] that he had, unintentionally no doubt,
              done a great injustice, by his reflections on the petitioners, a great injustice to as
              good men as live in the State of Indiana. It was the prostitution of the Grand Jury
              for political purposes in the County of Jefferson that caused the petition to be sent
              here, and the petition was signed by some very worthy citizens. He considered the
              provisions of the bill to be in the interest of the people, but not in the interest of
              the Prosecuting Attorneys of the State.</p>

            <p>Mr HEFFREN said, in explanation of his vote, that he was not in favor of the motion
              to postpone indefinitely. He thought the bill was one step toward progress and reform,
              which the Democratic party promised the people last fall. </p>

            <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone was agreed to-yeas, 59; nays, 29. </p>

              <p>Mr. Eley's bill [H. R. 154] providing for the election and qualification of

                recommendation that the bill do pass. The report was concurred in. </p>

              <p>Mr. ADAMS, from the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>; reported back

                hold real estate, with the recommendation that it lie on the table, for the reason
                that a similar bill is now before the Committee. The report was concurred in. </p>

              <head rend="center">OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH.</head>

              <p> Mr. ADAMS, from the same Committee, reported back Mr. Heffren's bill [H. R. 237]
                to amend Section 95 of an act concerning public offense, with the recommendation
                that it be indefinitely postponed. </p>

              <p>Mr HEFFREN said this bill was to amend the Sunday law. He thought the members of
                the House knew that the deliverer of milk, bread and ice, telegraph operators,
                printers and others of necessity worked on Sunday, and the bill was to prevent them
                from malicious prosecution. </p>

              <pb n="145" xml:id="VAA8558-21-144"/>

              <p>Mr. SMITH war of the opinion that the simple fact of its being a violation of the
                law was all that secured this much needed day of peace and rest to a certain class
                of our citizens. He feared that under the provisions of the bill before the House
                men would work seven days instead of six. He did not entertain the idea that it was
                necessary for a bootblack to work on Sunday, or that it was necessary for a man to
                shave on that day. He thought it was only the part of humanity that these needed
                protections should be thrown around the Sabbath in order that its blessing might
                continue undiminished.</p>

              <p>Mr ADAMS read the present exceptions to the Sunday law, and was of the opinion they
                did away with the provisions of the bill now under consideration. He did not think
                that because a druggist should be allowed the privilege of selling medicine on
                Sunday that he should also be given the privilege of disposing of his entire stock
                of goods.</p>

              <p>Mr. MOCK did not favor the indefinite postponement of the bill. If the provisions
                of the bill were too broad it ought to be amended and then passed. </p>

              <p>Mr. HEFFREN believed that the car of progress which the gentleman from Tippecanoe
                [Mr Smith] told us about the other day in such glowing language, is still rolling
                on; and that tradition and prejudice should be forgot; en in the light of our
                present civilization. A mankind becomes enlightened the old notions will be left in
                the rear. He believed in respecting the Sabbath, but certain things were now
                regarded as necessities, and necessity knows no law. It is time that these old fogy
                notions take a back seat. Men should take a new view of these matters That man does
                best who obeys the dictates of his conscience best. He move i that the bill be
                recommitted to the <orgName>Committee on Judiciary</orgName>.</p>

          <p>Prayer by Rev. John Baltzley.</p>

          <p>The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings were read until stopped by </p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">A CORRECTION OF THE JOURNAL.</head>

            <p> Mr HILLIGASS, who said: I desire to state that the journal is not right as to
              recording my vote on the resolution offered by the Senator from Brown [Mr. Duncan]. I
              am recorded as voting for the resolution, when in fact I think every Senator will
              recognize the fact that I voted against every proposition that came up on removal of
              the Doorkeeper until the final vote selecting Mr. Edmonds. I ask to have the journal
              corrected so as to show I voted against the resolution.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN thought it right and proper for the Senator to explain his vote on the
              floor so as to put himself right before the Senate and the world, but it is not right
              or proper to correct the journal, to which he objected. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I think the record ought to Si-and unless there is unanimous
              consent, to the change. </p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS: I have no doubt but that the Senator intended to vote as he says;
              bull must say the record shows just as he voted. I way watching particularly that
              vote, and know whereof I speak when I say the Senator voted as the journal shows. And
              I was surprised. I think it due that the Senator's explanation should be made, and
              that his explanation that he intended to vote otherwise should go upon the journals of
              the Senate. </p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: I think the Senator from Marion [Mr. Van Vorhis] is mistaken, I
              certainly knew what I was doing at that time, and if a response when my name was
              called led him to believe I was voting for the resolution, it came from somebody else
              than myself, I ask as a matter of justice to myself that the journal be corrected and
              I hope no Senator will object. I would not desire to have any Senator wrong upon the
              record. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Let us see if we can't fix it this way: we can't well go
              behind the returns we acted upon, but if the Senate will give consent let the Senator
              [Mr. Hilligass] change his vote, in the event it would not change the result. I don't
              think any man has any right to change the result Or let him make a statement in
              writing and put it on the record. The Senator for Marion,[Mr. Van Vorhis] said he
              voted the the other way. I can't recollect. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES: The journal ought to speak the truth. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: If the Senator voted "no" the journal ought to say that; but
              the journal ought not to say he voted "yes" when he voted "no." </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES: I am satisfied the Senator from Marion [Mr. Van Vorhis] is in error.</p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The best testimony would be the return made to the officer
              of the Senate. </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL cited a precedent where there was a bill reported as passed on the last day
              of a session in which a bill could be passed, where a Senator was recorded as having
              voted for the bill-and a house bill too-who came in the next morning insisting he had
              not voted for the bill. After thorough discussion and presentation of authorities the
              record was changed his vote was placed against the bill and the law failed for that
              reason. While this proposed change may make s particular difference, I think it is
              within the power of the Senate, in every case, to have the record speak the truth. I
              will take a brother Senator's word about what his vote was, because a man who would
              make the statement that he is improperly recorded, when such was not the truth, would
              not be fit for any gentleman to associate with in a Legislative or any other body.
              Unless it is apparent the Senator is mistaken his statement ought to be received as
              true. I would not care a fig for this except for the precedent. Now if the Senate
              itself does not have full control of the journal-if it may not at any time before its
              final approval of the journal, without question from any source, make the journal
              speak the exact truth, then this Senate is at the mercy of some inefficient, careless
              or corruptt Clerk. I don't mean to say we have such a Clerk, but to point out the
              danger if we should have one and this right should not be extended. It would be
              entirely wrong to question our power over the journal-until it is finally approved, to
                <pb n="147" xml:id="VAA8558-21-146"/> make it speak the exact truth. If there be a
              doubt as to the fact it is right for the Senate to vote on the testimony. In the
              absence of unusually strong testimony showing a Senator is mistaken his statement
              should be taken as true. But suppose the statement of the Senator be questioned, and
              we have an opposite statement from another Senator on the same point, then the
              question of fact comes before Senate. </p>

            <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Then you have the Secretary of the Senate. </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL: I acknowledge the force to a certain extent of the fact that we have a
              roll-call made by a Secretary of the Senate. I don't want it to go unquestioned,
              because it may have some weight in determining the fact, but it has nothing of
              conclusiveness about it at all. We all know when there is any confusion or noise in
              the Chamber, how easy it if for the Clerk to make a mistake in his record Pie is but a
              finger, so to speak, on the right hand of the Senate, and no mistake of any Clerk can
              effect the right of the Senate to correct its journal. Here is a matter of fact for us
              to determine. We have the right to make the journal speak the exact truth, we might
              institute an investigation into the facts if it were a matter of sufficient
              importance. I speak only because of the Importance of acting so as not to set a bad
              precedent. </p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS: I do not want to be understood in any sense as calling into question
              the word of the Senator from Huntington [Mr. Hilligass]. I think that under the
              excitement of the moment for he was considerably excited, that he does not know just
              exactly how he did vote, but that he voted as he now says is a mistake. I have no
              question he is honest in his belief he voted as he now states, but I was so situated
              when that vote was being taken, and watching the vote particularly to hear that
              gentlemen on that side were voting "aye" on that question, and I heard an affirmative
              response in answer to the call of Senator Hilligass' name, and was surprised when it
              was announced. There are other gentlemen on this side of the House who observed just
              exactly the same thing. Of course, what the Senator from Allen and Whitley [Mr. Bell]
              says about the record speaking the exact truth, there is no question about that; but
              the question is, what is the truth? I have no objection, if not taken as a precedent,
              that the Senator shall have the right to record his vote as he now says he intended to
              vote. But that he voted as recorded I thought it was due to the Clerk I should state
              as I have stated.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN, without stating anything as to what is right or wrong on this question,
              hoped the Senator from Rush [Mr. Spann] would withdraw his objection, and allow the
              journal to be corrected as desired by the Senator from Huntington [Mr. Hilligass], and
              we agree that it will not be taken as a precedent. We do this now for the purpose of
              allowing a brother Senator to stand on the record as he desires.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN withdrew his objection. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: By unanimous consent, Senator Hilligass changes his vote on
              the roll call.</p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY: There is another correction. On the point of order made by the Senator
              from Clinton [Mr. Marvin] that no Doorkeeper could be elected by a resolution. He
              waived that and therefore the journal misstates the point of order. </p>

            <p>Mr. DUNCAN: The first point of order raised by the Senator from Clinton [Mr Marvin]
              was that my resolution was not in order. The Chair decided I had leave to introduce
              the resolution because the Senate had just declared it would proceed at once to the
              election of a Doorkeeper. Then the Senator from Clinton raised the point of order that
              we could not elect an officer of the Senate by a resolution. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN: That is the newspaper report, also.</p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I recollect it the way Senator Duncan has it.</p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY: There was a ruling only on the one question. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I think that is the way it was. </p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN: I did not waive any point I made. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The Senator raised a point that the Doorkeeper could not be
              elected by a resolution, but it was not acted upon. I don't think I passed on that
              question. The question is: Shall the min lies stand, as far as read and corrected, as
              the minutes of me Senate? It is so ordered. The Secretary has made a mark on the
              Journal up to where it is read and approved, and the Committee will have to examine
              the balance of it.</p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS asked and obtained consent to consider the report now. He explained
              that the Committee recommended amending the bill so that the number of Justices in a
              Township shall not exceed two with one additional for each incorporated town and city
              in the Township, and that they be required to reside and hold Court in the Township,
              town or city for which they are elected or appointed. It will give the city of

              <p> Mr. Smith's, of Delaware, bill [S. 58-see page 39 of the Brevier Reports] to
                regulate weights and measures was read the second time.</p>

              <p> Mr. RISTINE understands the act proposed to be amended by this bill is void and
                not in the Revised Statutes of 1881, consequently, it can not be amended now.</p>

              <p> Mr. SMITH was understood to say he found it in the code. </p>

              <p>Mr. DAVIDSON recollected the bill was voted down in the Senate two years ago when
                he made some remarks on the Question. </p>

              <p>Mr. HILLIGASS moved to insert "68" instead of "70" pounds with reference to the
                weight of corn. </p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH stated the object of this bill was to make the legal weight of corn
                seventy pounds in order to conform to the custom of neighboring States. There is no
                loss to the farmer, because the difference is always taken from them in price. </p>

              <p>Mr. MARVIN did not know of a warehouse dealer but desired the change made to
                seventy pounds. </p>

              <p>Mr. WHITE believed his people preferred the standard as the law now provides. </p>

              <p>Mr. HILLIGASS also preferred the standard should remain as the law now fixes it.
                Men in the business are the only ones favoring a change. Farmers are not. </p>

              <p>Mr. DUNCAN believed only warehouse-men are clamoring for this change. It was not
                the farmers He favored sixty-eight pounds to the bushel in the in few it of his own
                corn-raising district. </p>

              <p>Mr. MARVIN, as one farmer and as a Senator, should favor the proposed increase. </p>

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM was sure the price would correspond with the number of pounds to the
                bushel, and to secure uniformity he favored the bill as introduced.</p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH stated it to be the universal desire of both trading men and farmers that
                seventy pounds should be the legal standard, to correspond with adjoining States, as
                they are accustomed to doing now. </p>

              <p>Mr KEISER, having no expression from his people, would favor the present standard
                and oppose a change. The yeas and nays were ordered on the adoption of the amendment
                (Mr. Hilligass'), and being ordered and taken, resulted-yeas, 21; nays, 1. </p>

              <p>Mr. Willard demanded a call of the Senate, which discovered 29 Senators present and

            was dispensed with. </p>

            <p> Mr. Stucker's bill [H. R. 186] to amend Section 33 of an act providing for the
              election of County Superintendent of Schools, by providing that elections shall
              hereafter be by popular vote, coming up with amendments, recommended by the
                <orgName>Committee on County and Township Business</orgName>. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH moved to strike from the bill all after the enacting clause. He belived
              that the present mode of electing County Superintendents was a just and good one and
              should be continued. He considered the Township Trustees representative men of fair
              intelligence, and was not in accord with the statement that they were not refined men.
              He did not wish to cast any reflection on the electors of the State in his advocacy of
              the present mode of electing County Superintendents. Should this q question be made a
              political matter and the nomination of County Superintendent be left to a political
              Convention, he feared that the nominee would as often be selected because of the
              geographical position he held in the County as because of his fitness for the place to
              be filled. He looked upon politics as the science of Government and not a dirty pool
              as some persons ex- pressed it. A few years back he had been an opposer of the system
              that he now favored. </p>

            <p>Mr. MELLET desired that his amendment should not prevail. He would hate to see
              anything done by this General Assembly that would weaken or in any way destroy the
              effectiveness of the County Superintendent system; but he believed that this being an
              office of the people should be filled by the people. He was not one of those men who
              feared to leave the filling of any office in the hands of the people. He did no con-
              sider it a political office, and felt that if it was placed in the hands of the people
              it would often be filled better than many of the offices are to<pb n="149"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-148"/>day. No office is too pure or too high to trust it in the
              hands of the people. </p>

            <p>Mr SHOCKNEY insisted that the people ought to nave this right of selecting County
              Superintendents since they had to hear the expenses of the office. He believed that
              the bill should be adopted and that the amendment should be rejected. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELY considered the power of a County Superintendent almost unlimited, and
              that in many respects the County Superintendent was an autocrat. It is an office, in
              his opinion, that should be filled by the people. He thought, that the bill should
              prevail, and that the amendment should be rejected. </p>

            <p>Mr. STUCKER could not see any reason why the election of County Superintendents
              should not be in the hands of the people, as are all other officers of the State. He
              believed that the office was as far in politics as it could be if the present bill
              should become a law. </p>

            <p> The motion to strike out was laid on the table. </p>

            <p>A motion by Mr. SMITH to change she time of election from November to April 1884, and
              a motion by Mr. GREENE to recommit the bill with the amendments of the Committee to
              the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName> were severally laid on the table.</p>

            <p>A motion by Mr. GORDON that no County Superintendent would be eligible to that office
              for more than four years in any period of eight years, was agreed to by yeas, 50,
              nays, 33. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT offered an amendment that no County Superintendent should be allowed for
              more than 120 days services in any period of twelve months. </p>

            <p>Mr. Jewett thought 120 days sufficient for the performance of the actual services of
              any County Superintendent in the State. If 120 days was not sufficient time for the
              performance of his duties, Mr. Jewett would favor granting more days than expressed in
              his amendment.</p>

            <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY staled that under the law as it now exists, and as the provisions of the
              present bill will leave it, the work of the County Superintendent could not be
              performed in the time allowed by the amendment offered by Mr. Jewett. He believed that
              the work could not be done in less than 200 days. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN did not favor the amendment. He believed that if the time of a
              Superintendent was to be limited the result would be some foolish fellow would be
              elected to the office, who would not be competent to fill the position and that the
              office would not be accepted by a competent person. Tacking on these amendments, he
              thought would eventually kill the bill by making it so ineffectual that its friends
              would vote against it. He moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas, 52; nays, 36.</p>

            <p>A motion by Mr. HANSON to limit the time of service to 150 days, was laid on the
              table by yeas, 46; nays, 35.</p>

            <p>Mr. STEWART moved that the bill with all amendments be recommended to a Special
              Committee of Three, who should incorporate all amendments and report, the bill so
              amended to the House not later than Tuesday next.</p>

            <p> Pending these motions the House took a recess until 2 o'clock. </p>

            <p>The question now recurred on the motion of Mr Stewart that the bill with amendments
              be referred to a Special Committee of Three, who should incorporate the amendments and
              report the same back to the House no later than next Tuesday. The motion was agreed

              <head rend="center">INTEREST ON SCHOOL FUND</head>

              <p>Mr. Antrim's bill [H. R. 16] to regulate the interest on the school fund was
                reported back from the <orgName>Committee on County and Township Business</orgName>,
                with the recommendation that the bill be amended by striking out six and inserting
                seven, making the interest 7 per cent. instead of 6, as provided in the bill, and
                that when so amended the bill do pass. The report of the Committee was concurred in,
                and the question recurring on the adoption of the amendment-</p>

              <p> Mr. WILSON, of Marion, understood that about 95 per cent. of the school fund had
                been loaned at the present rate-8 per cent. He was creditably informed by persons of
                financial foresight that there would be no difficulty in loaning this fund for the
                next two years at the present rate of interest-8 per cent.</p>

              <p> Mr. GORDON could see no reason why the interest should be reduced below 8 per
                cent. We should look to the interest of the school fund and not to the interest of
                persons who desired to borrow this money. He believed with the gentleman from Marion
                [Mr. Wilson] that there would be an appreciation instead of a deprecation of the
                desire for school fund in the next two years, He had been informed that there had
                been a decrease in the length of the school terms in this State, and if this bill
                should prevail there would of necessity be further decrease in the length of the
                school terms. He could see no reason why we should strike off one-fourth of the
                interest of the school fund.</p>

              <p> Mr. MOODY did not propose to enter into a discussion with gentlemen on this floor
                as to whether all the school fund in the State can or can not be loaded at the
                present rate of interest. He did not think that extortion was right, nor that, if
                every dollar of the school fund of the State could be loaned at 10 per cent. to the
                already burdened taxpayers of our State who hold this money, that it would be just
                for us to compel them to do so. On an examination of the records in the Recorder's
                office of the State the gentleman will find that this large and magnificent fund is
                loaned to small land owners of moderate means, who of all men should be protected
                from usury and extortion. These funds are loaned in small amounts ranging from $300
                to $600. Every man making a loan of this fund must pay the interest in advance, pay
                for an abstract of title costing him from $3 to $5 pay for a mortgage and the
                recording thereof, which amounts in the aggregate to about $6 or $8. We do not think
                it right to say that corporations and individuals may contract for and receive the
                highest rate of interest their money will command, but we have made the legal rate 6
                per cent., why then should we say this fund shall not be loaned for less than 8 per
                cent? He thought the fund should be loaned at 6 per cent. </p>

              <p> Mr. SMITH stated that he could commence where the gentleman from DeKalb [Mr.
                Moody] left off. He then read from a report which he had in his possession showing
                the amount of school <pb n="150" xml:id="VAA8558-21-149"/> fund in each County, and
                also the amount loaned. The report showed that a very large per cent. of the school
                fund of each County was loaned at the present rate of 8 per cent. He stated that the
                testimony went to show that many Counties could loan twice the amount which they
                have at the present rate, and some claim that they could loan twice the amount at 10
                per cent. He was not in favor of reducing the rate of interest while the money could
                be loaned at 8 per cent. </p>

              <p>Mr. HEFFREN favored a 6 per cent. rate, but if the House will not agree to that he
                would favor a 7 per cent. rate. He moved that the amendment be laid on the
                table.</p>

              <p>The motion was agreed to-yeas, 62; nays, 14. </p>

              <p>Mr. HANSON made an ineffectual motion-yeas, 29; nays, 42-to indefinitely postpone
                the further consideration of the bill.</p>

              to replevy personal property from Constables when levy has been made. The way the law
              now stands the plaintiff can bring his action for trial of rights of property under
              Section 1,529 of the Revised Statutes of 1881, which is correct, but under Section
              1,547 the plaintiff may replevy and run the Constable to a large bill of cost, and
              there is no law to protect him in such cases. The object of the bill is to have all
              such cases brought under the act to try the right of property.</p>

            <p> Mr. Spain's bill [H. R. 202] to provide for the location and erection of an
              additional Asylum for the Insane, was returned with a favorable report thereon. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, moved to amend by striking out the word "Evansville" wherever
              it occurs and insert the word''Vincennes" in lieu thereof. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT objected, upon the ground that the people of Evansville were entitled to a
              square vote upon the bill, and that amendments inserting the names of other cities
              ought not to be entertained. The Evansville people had originated the idea of locating
              a new Insane Asylum at their city, and were interesting themselves a good deal in
              behalf of the project. He did not know whether the House would accede to the
              proposition, but as the bill had been introduced in th interest of Evansville, he
              thought that other cities who might desire to secure a new Asylum should have a bill
              of Their own introduced, and not seek to embarrass the Evansville people, as now
              proposed. He moved to lay the motion upon the table. </p>

            <p>Mr. Williams, of Knox, and Mr. Patton demanded the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays
              being ordered and taken discovered a quorum not present, and toe Speaker ordered a
              call of the House, which found sixty-seven members present and answering to their
              names.</p>

            <p> The yeas and nays being called again, on the motion to lay on the table, the vote
              resulted yeas, 56; nays, 11. </p>

            <p>So the motion was agreed to. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Kosciusko, moved to amend by striking out the word "Evansville"
              wherever it occurs and inserting in its place the word "Indianapolis."</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Posey, moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>

            <p>This motion was agreed to. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. Jewett the bill was ordered engrossed for a third reading. </p>

            <p> Mr. Mock's bill [H. R. 269] concerning elections, was reported back from the
                <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName>, with amendments.</p>

            <p>Mr DEEM moved to indefinitely postpone the bill and amendments. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOCK desired to say in reference to the bill that there had been a great deal of
              fraud in his County by voting double tickets and again there has been a great deal of
              fraud perpetuated by using stickers. The provisions of the bill were intended to
              prevent this. He thought that the bill and amendments ought to be adopted, It
              practically makes it illegal to vote for any one except the regular nominees whose
              names are upon the tickets of each party. The object of the bill is to render it
              impossible to scratch without writing in the name of the person other than the regular
              nominee for whom a vote is desired to be cast; and it proposes that when a printed
              sticker is used neither the candidate named or; the sticker nor the one whose name is
              pasted over are to get the benefit of the vote. </p>

            <p>Mr. DEEM thought under the provision of the bill it would be necessary for every
              little town to place partisan nominees in the field at every town or municipal
              election. In his County these offices were not made a partisan manner, and he did not
              desire to see them become such. </p>

            <p>Mr WILLIAMS thought it was a good bill, and that the gentleman on the floor last [Mr.
              Deem] did not understand the provisions of the bill. He thought that the bill ought
              not to b indefinitely postponed. </p>

            <p>Mr HAM had examined the bill thoroughly, and in ought there was nothing objectionable
              in the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, was opposed to using stickers, but he feared that should
              this bill <pb n="160" xml:id="VAA8558-21-159"/> become a law it would prevent men from
              voting or running independently for any office. He was not in favor of placing any
              restrictions upon independent voting.</p>

            <p>The House took a recess until 2 o'clok. </p>

              <p> Mr. JEWETT moved that the House resolve itself into a <orgName>Committee of the
                  Whole</orgName> for the consideration of this special order.</p>

              <p> The motion was agreed to and-</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. HEFFREN the bill was taken up. The House agreeing to consider the
                same section by section. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, moved to reduce the salary of the Adjutant General from
                $1,400 to $1,200, understanding there are fees and perquisites, appertaining to this
                office, which should be considered in fixing the salary.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, considered $1,400 small enough salary for any capable man
                That officer has already been a saving to the State. </p>

              <p>Mr. MOODY moved to make the salary $1,500. </p>

              <p>Mr. FRAZER opposed anything below $1,400.</p>

              <p>On motion the amendments were laid on the table by yeas, 48: nays, 47. </p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, made a motion, which was laid on the table, for a
                contingent fund of $500 for the Attorney General. </p>

              <p>Mr. GREEN moved that the night watchman of the State Library be paid $600 instead
                of $500, and be required to visit each office every hour during the night. </p>

              <p>Mr JEWETT moved to amend the amendment by substituting $500 for $600.</p>

              <p>This motion was agreed to.</p>

              <p>The amendment as amended was adopted.</p>

              <p>Mr. McMULLEN moved to increase the appropriation for the support of feeble minded
                children from $10,000 to $12,500.</p>

              <p>It was agreed to.</p>

              <p> Mr. ADAMS moved to increase the appropriation for the State University from
                $23,000 to $25,000, provided $5,000 of this amount be placed in the hands of the
                Board to be used for repair of the building.</p>

              <p> Mr. JEWETT. The amount proposed by the Committee in this bill will cover current
                expenses, and if any additional amount is required it should be by special
                appropriation. The Committee does not believe $5,000 is needed for the repair of the
                buildings. </p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, of Posey, the amendment was laid on the table.</p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH of Tippecanoe, moved to increase the appropriation for Purdue University
                from $2,000 to $5,000. He said to make the appropriation $2,000 simply means to
                destroy the institution for the next two years. He did not represent the Purdue
                Institute. It should be represented by every man in this House. Each County in the
                State is entitled to send two students there free of all expense, except an
                incidental Janitor's fee. Twenty-five thousand dollars is necessary. </p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT did not think the Purdue University was well managed. It has a permanent
                endowment furs of $320,000. The interest from that, with the $2,000 proposed by the
                Committee in this bill, he thought was surely enough.</p>

              <p>Mr. Heffren referred to a recent difficulty between the faculty and students. </p>

              <p>Mr SMITH, of Tippecanoe, replied to objections urged to the conduct of the faculty.
                $23,000 has been voted to the State University, an old-established institution,
                while it is proposed to cutoff this young ward of the State with but $2,000. It is
                not fair to strangle it in its youth. He appealed to the friends of agriculture to
                rally to the support of Purdue University with liberal appropriation.</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. HEFFREN the amendment was laid on the table-yeas, 47; nays, 27. </p>

              <p>Mr. GILMAN moved to make the appropriation $10,000. It was laid on the table. </p>

              <p>Mr. HANSON moved to make it $20,000. </p>

              <p>Mr. HOWLAND moved to make it $15,000. </p>

              <p>The amendments were laid on the table-yeas, 41; nays, 39.</p>

              <p>Mr. HOWLAND moved to insert $9,500 instead of $2,000.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILEY moved to substitute $14,000 instead of $2,000 no part of this sum to be
                used while any restrictions are put upon the students by the faculty or Board of
                Trustees concerning their Greek Societies. </p>


              <p>Mr. HOWLAND reminded the House that this is the one institution in the State
                designed for the education of farmers and mechanics, and those classes are entitled
                to some facilities for advancement. </p>

              <p>Mr. HEFFREN would not vote for the bill if this heavy appropriation was tacked on
                it. </p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT would regard such an amendment in the light of a rider on this bill, and
                for that and other reasons he hoped the amendment would not prevail.</p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH. of Tippecanoe, paid there had been attempts made to initiate members of
                this House into secret societies just for the purpose of defeating this
                appropriation. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILS0N, of Marion, understood this institution has an income of about $18,000
                on interest from the endowment fund, and this $2,000 appropriation will give it
                $20,000. There ought to be an institution of this kind maintained in this State. Two
                thousand dollars is too small. A medium between that and $20,000 is best. </p>

              <p>The House adjourned. </p>

              <head rend="center">THE NORTHERN PRISON.</head>

              <p> Mr. Hatchinson's bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_050">S. 50</ref>] concerning
                the official term of the Director of the Northern State Pris )n was read the second
                time, with a favorable report from a majority of the <orgName>Committee on State
                  Prisons</orgName>, and a minority report recommending a substitute bill requiring
                one of the Directors to be selected from the present Board, so as to have an
                experienced member of the Board, etc., etc.</p>

              <p>Mr. Campbell stated the object of the minority report, because of the benefit of
                experience, to place the Board in better shape to transact its business. Conceding
                qualifications which always accompany experience, the minority report recommends the
                selection of one experienced Director, who can give the benefit of experience to the
                other members. Anoiher object of the substitute: It provides for the election of
                successors after the terms of these officers expire, which latter latter measure is
                not in the original bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES said the Directors already selected are men placed in the positions
                because of their qualification. The object of the bill is to make the Board of
                Directors serve for a term of four years-both Prison Directors should serve the same
                length of time.</p>

              <p>The minority report was rejected by yeas, 19; nays, 23.</p>

              <p> The majority report was concurred in. </p>

              <head rend="center">ROADS AND HIGHWAYS.</head>

              <p>On motion by Mr. BENZ the Senate took up the special order for this hour [2:30
                o'clock p. m], being his bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_006">S. 6</ref>] for the
                election and appointment of Supervisors of Highways.-See pp. 98 and 131 of the
                Brevier Reports.</p>

              <p>Mr. Henry's substitute bill-see page 98-was rejected by yeas, 21; nays, 24.</p>

              <p>The question recurring on the minority report recommending the substitution of new
                matter-</p>

              <p>Mr. RISTINE explained the substitute embodies two sections from Mr. Voyles' bill
                with reference to working out road tax in the Township </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES said that law does not provide for filling a vacanc in the office of
                Road Superintendent; and if other respects could be improved, but there is such a
                clamor for the old law he believed it better to pass the bill <ref
                  target="#SB_1883_01_04_006">No 6</ref> as introduced. He hoped She minority report
                would be temporarily, at least, rejected. If the bill No. 6 fails then he would be
                in favor of the minority report. </p>

              <p>The minority report was rejected by yeas, 19; nays, 27.</p>

              <p>The majority report of the Committee was concurred in by yeas, 31; nays, 14. </p>

              <p>Mr. MARVIN moved to amend the bill by requiring the Supervisor to be a freeholder
                for the reason that the Supervisor should be a responsible man, and if not a
                freeholder he can not be made legally responsible.</p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY opposed the amendment. If there is any reason why a man, In order to be a
                Road Supervisor should be a freeholder, he did not know of it. There are many
                irresponsible men who own land and many responsible men who do not own any land.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN thought every man should have a fair chance to obtain public favor. He
                desired to see every honest, aspiring young man have a fair Chance to become a Road
                Supervisor. </p>

              <p>Mr. BENZ said: "I am opposed to that amendment, and will state my reason. When I
                was a young man I was elected Supervisor, and I did it so well I was elected twice,
                when I was elected School Trustee Then I was elected County Coroner, and held an
                inquest on a nigger twice. [Laughter,] On the same nigger twice. [Renewed laughter.]
                I'll tell you how it was about that nigger I held an inquest over twice, I gave a
                man $5 to bury him, and he put him in the river with a stone around him; but the
                rock got loose and they found him again and I had another inquest over him
                [Laughter.] Then they elected me as Representative, and twice as Senator, and next
                step I'm going to beat my friend Browne for Congress. [Applause]</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to amend the amendment by adding the words "or householder." </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN objected to both amendments. If we are going back to the old law let it
                stand free to all.</p>

              <p>Mr. MARVIN insisted the Supervisor should be legally responsible, so he can be
                compelled to do <pb n="163" xml:id="VAA8558-21-162"/> his duty. One reason the old
                law became unpopular was the Supervisor was irresponsible in many cases and would
                not be forced to do his duty. </p>

              <p> Mr. FAULKNER worked four years ago in the House of Representatives to get the
                property qualification out of the law. It does not require property to make a man
                tell the truth and be honest. He favored an open field and a fair fight.</p>

              <p> Mr. WILLARD withdrew his amendment to the amendment so that the question may come
                directly on the freeholder question.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>

              <p> The motion was rejected-yeas, 17; nays, 28.</p>

              <p> The amendment was rejected by yeas, 2; nays, 43.</p>

              <p> Mr. MAGEE moved to amend so as to prevent Supervisors giving a reciept for road
                tax when the work has not been done, for the reason that the Supervisor sometimes
                gives a receipt for work done, before it is done, in fact, and there ought to be a
                clause in the bill preventing such action.</p>

              <p> It was agreed to.</p>

              <p> Mr. VOYLES moved to amend by requiring Township Trustees to appoint a Road
                Supervisor to serve till a successor is elected.</p>

              <p> Mr. RISTINE thought the work already commenced ought to be closed up and provision
                so made in the bill.</p>

              <p> Mr. WILLARD understands the proviso continuing the present Supervisors in office
                until April 1884, will permit them to operate this new law until that time-this bill
                having no emergency clause.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY moved to amend the amendment by making the road districts an area of not
                less than six square miles.</p>

              <p> Mr. VOYLES accepted the amendment. He desired to have the law go in operation as
                soon as passed, thereby lagislating out the officers under the present system.</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN opposed the amendment. The complaint against the present law seems to be
                the failure of means to raise revenue to put in the hands of the road
                superintendents. Let the majority report prevail-continue the present law one year
                longer.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY did not understand the provisions of this bill were to be carried out by
                the present officers.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN, if mistaken, would be glad to see the bill amended.</p>

              <p> Mr. RAHM opposed the amendment. In his County the roads needed working badly. Men
                were called out and got the roads in order and were given orders on the Treasurer
                which will be used next month in paying taxes. He did not want such cases cut
                out.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN moved to amend by way of substitute that this act shall not take effect
                until April, 1884. This would cure the defect in the section to which his attention
                was called by the Senator from Madison [Mr. Henry].</p>

              <p> Mr. CAMPBELL favored the amendment believing it would meet with approbation in the
                northern part of the state. </p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN considered laws should take effect upon publication throughout the
                State, or in cases of emergency as provided in the Constitution. A demand for the
                old law can not well be met by re-enacting it and providing it shall not take effect
                for some fourteen months to come.</p>

              <p> The substitute [Mr. Spann's] was adopted by yeas, 23; nays, 22.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY moved to amend by adding that the road districts shall not be less than
                six square miles of area.</p>

              <p> It was agreed to.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY moved to amend by limiting the time to thirty days' pay in any one year
                to the Supervisor.</p>

              <p> It was agreed to.</p>

              <p>Mr. KEISER moved to amend by increasing the Supervisor's pay from $1.50 to $2.</p>

              <p>Mr. BENZ objected; $1.50 is enough.</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN favored the amendment.</p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS moved to insert "$2.50" in place of the "$2" in the amendment.</p>

              <p> Mr. WHITE thought $1.50 a day would be satisfactory to the farming community
                generally.</p>

              <p> The amendment to the amendment was rejected by yeas 2; nays, 14.</p>

              <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS moved to lay the amendment on the table. </p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question on this motion.</p>

              <p>The demand was not seconded-affirmative, 21; negative, 22.</p>

              <p> Mr. KEISER withdrew his amendment.</p>

              <p>Section 1, as amended, was adopted.</p>

              <p> On motion by Mr. HENRY the word "biennial" was substituted for the word annual in
                Section 3, where it occurs before the word "election."</p>

              <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS moved to strike out Section 4. We ought to be able to secure
                supervision without making it a penal offense for them to refuse.</p>

              <p>The motion was rejected.</p>

              <p> Mr. HILLIGASS moved to amend Section 5 by requiring a $100 bond of the Supervisor
                for faithful discharge of his duties.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY offered a substitute for this amendment for a $300 bond.</p>

              <p> Mr. MAGEE opposed both the amendment and the substitute. The Supervisor is
                compelled to serve, and it would be an additional hardship to require a bond, which
                in many instances would be difficult to comply with.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY insisted on making as good a law as possible out of this: if it is a
                foregone conclusion it must be passed, as it seems to be. There ought to be a bond
                given. There should be some safeguards placed in the bill.</p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS favored this amendment, but there is the trouble in Section 4, which
                ought to be stricken out.</p>

              <p> Mr. MARVIN saw the Senate coming back to where he desired the start-to make the
                Supervisor responsible. He opposed requiring a bond of the Supervisor, as the bill
                stands.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY withdrew his substitute and-</p>

              <p> Mr. HILLIGASS amends his by making the Supervisor's bond $200 condition for a
                faithful discharge of his duties.</p>

              <p> The amendment was agreed to.</p>

              <p> Mr. GRAHAM moved to add a proviso if such Supervisor be unable to give bond, such
                inability shall be a defense to the collection of the forfeiture provided in Section
                4.</p>

              <p> The amendment was agreed to.</p>

              <p> Pending the consideration of Section 5-</p>

              <p> The Senate adjourned.</p>

          <p>The SPEAKER called the House to order.</p>

          <p>The session was opened with prayer by Rev. F. M. S. Taylor, Dean of St. Paul's
            Cathedral.</p>

          <p>On motion the reading of the Clerk's journal was dispensed with.</p>

          <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY offered a resolution, which was not agreed to, that the Standing Committee
            of the House be instructed to report all bills back in the order in which said bills had
            been introduced into the House. The resolution set forth that certain bills had been in
            the hands of the Committees for some time, while other bills introduced later in the
            session had been reported back from the Committees.</p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>

            <p>The House resumed the consideration of the bill [H. R. 302] making appropriations for
              the State Government and its institutions, directing the application of such
              appropriations, requiring accounts to be kept by the fiscal years of the State, and
              repealing inconsistent laws which was ending at the adjournment yesterday. </p>

            <pb n="164" xml:id="VAA8558-21-163"/>

            <p>The SPEAKER announced the question before the House to be the amendment of Mr. Wiley
              to the amendment offered by Mr. Howland, that the appropriations for Purdue University
              be increased fr m $2,000 to $9,500-Mr. Wiley's amendment proposing to make the
              appropriation $14,000. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT moved to lay the amendment to the amendment on the table.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to. </p>

            <p>Mr. ROBINSON moved to amend the amendment by inserting <unclear reason="faded"
                >$1[?],000</unclear> instead of $9,500 as proposed by the gentleman from Marion [Mr.
              Howland]. He understood that this was the only Institution in the State of Indiana
              provided and maintained in the interest of agriculture and manufacturing, and observed
              that the objection did not come. from that part of the State where the institution is
              located, but from members from other parts of the State. He thought that as the
              farmers of the State pay more than one-half of the taxes of the State, it would not be
              in good taste to shove this Institution off with a mere pitance; it would be better
              taste to give it a fair appropriation. He hoped members who stood hereto represent the
              agricultural interest, and people of the State and the mechanical interest would
              increase this appropriation so that Purdue would get something more than $2,000.</p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, said the State of Indiana in its Legislative capacity
              accepted the princely gift; of Purdue University, and pledged herself to perpetually
              fester and sustain it on the terms of the joint gift of the doors forever as a College
              of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. Will the Legislature now strangle this Institution
              and thus violate the compact? If so, will not the donors claim to reversion of their
              gift? The entire proceeds from the interest on the endowment fund are used in paying
              the salaries of instructors. and the Legislature is asked for an appropriation to meet
              the current incidental expenses, each item of which is set forth in the report of the
              Trustees. To-day the value of land, buildings and appurtenances is $312,000, or
              including endowment fund an aggregate of $652,000, showing that all interests have
              been cared for.</p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN had filtered to this discussion with some attention, and was unable to
              understand why some gentlemen had been advocating an increase of this appropriation.
              He desired to know what they wanted with the appropriation? </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH (interrupting): Two thousand dollars will not furnish the coal for the
              Institution.</p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN (continuing) understood that Purdue University would not come begging the
              Legislature every time it was in session. There is nothing practical about this
              Institution. It does not benefit the farmers at all. The farmers' sons are not
              educated there. He knew many of the students educated at this Institution become
              farmers? No, sir; they do not become farmers, and never will become farmers. Men do
              not send their sons there to become farmers. He was not opposed to Educational
              Institutions whatever. He found that gentlemen who were advocating a large
              appropriation had an ax to grind. </p>

            <p>Mr. MUTZ knew something about Purdue University, and desired to state to the members
              what he knew concerning this Institution. He was as much opposed to large
              appropriations as the gentleman from Sullivan [Mr. Patten.] He knew they had a good
              Institution down at Purdue-an Institution that no man ought to be ashamed of. He
              educated one of his sons in this University, and he had never regretted it. When you
              talk about $2,000 or $9,000 for Purdue, it is too small. He regretted that men would
              get up on the floor and talk about giving Purdue $2,000. Give it enough so that it may
              run with credit to the Institution and to the State. Purdue is doing a good work, and
              nos only a good work, but a great work. He was in favor of a large appropriation. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Kosciusko, combatted the statement that Purdue University is
              inefficient and on the decline, referring to the reports of that Institution for proof
              to the contrary. The decrease in the academic department is owing to a higher grade of
              qualification being required for those who enter the University. The success of a
              farmer is not to be judged by the amount of produce sold only, but by the value of his
              experience. As two students are allowed to be sent to the Purdue University from each
              County he did cot think the Legislature could afford to strangle that Institution,
              but, rather, should carefully faster it. He favored the $12,000 appropriation. </p>

            <p>Mr. STEWART made an ineffectual motion-yeas, 43; nays, 46-to lay the amendment on the
              table. </p>

            <p>The amendment was agreed to by yeas, 92; nays, 38, and the amendment as amended was
              also agreed to. </p>

            <p>Mr. SCHLOSS moved to amend the appropriation for the State Normal School by inserting
              seven thousand dollars in place of five thousand. He explained that there had been a
              considerable increase in the number of students, and it would require the extra two
              thousand dollars to carry on the school properly. He thought that as there had been
              such an increase in the number of students the appropriation should be likewise
              increased. He hoped that the House would grant the extra two thousand dollars. </p>

            <p>Mr SMITH thought that an extra $2,000 would be a very small sum, and hoped the House
              would grant the extra $2,000. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT desired to state that the amount was the largest ever granted to the State
              Normal School, and read the several amounts granted for previous years. He further
              explained that the entire expenses of the Institution way not met by this
              appropriation, but that the law provides that the Superintendent of Public Instruction
              shall draw a certain sum in favor of this Institution.</p>

            <p>The amendment was rejected. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN moved to strike out the $5,000 appropriated for the State Board of Health. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT stated that the Committee did not see way clear in this matter, but he
              considered the better than to be the continuance of the appropriation. </p>

            <p>Mr. STEWART desired that the amendment of the gentleman [Mr. Patten's] would not
              prevail, and that the House would concur in the original appropriation "</p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN favored the adoption of the amendment. He stated that the $5,000 granted
              in the appropriation was only a mere pittance of the amount the State Board of Health
              cost the people of the State. He thought that a vote on the adoption of the amendment
              would decide whether or not the members were in favor of continuing the State Board of
              Health.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, stated that there had been two or three bill? introduced to
              repeal the law creating a State Board of Health, and that the friends ot the said
              Board have asked permission to be heard on this question before the bills are reported
              back on to-morrow Let this bill be acted upon. It does not continue the State Board of
              Health; and let these men have a chance to present this matter to the Committee. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILEY desired to say a few words in answer to the statement of the gentleman from
              Washington [Mr. Heffren] that the State Board of Health had cost the people several
              thousand dollars, and that he was unable to see that it had benefited them any. He had
              been reliably informed that contagious diseases have been entirely removed in certain
              localities. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT (interrupting) asked if it was not a fact that a large part of the outlay
              so far has been for books and articles that will last for a long time to come. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILEY stated that such was the fact. He would rather kill this Board of Health
              outright than to strangle it by withholding the ap<pb n="165" xml:id="VAA8558-21-164"
              />propriation. He favored granting the appropriation.</p>

            <p> Mr. McHENRY thought that the statistics of this Board were of little practical
              value, since many physicians had failed to make the required reports of deaths,
              births, etc; but it has been two short-lived to tell the result. He favored the
              appropriation, and said if the Legislature decides it must die let it be by a fair
              vote and not by strangling it to death.</p>

            <p> Mr. MOODY believed the House ought to allow the appropriation and decide the matter
              on the merits or demerits of the bills when they reported back from the Committee.
              Allow these men who are prepared to show the effectiveness of this Board of Health, to
              appear before the Committee. In his opinion the existence of this Board has been too
              short to determine its usefulness.</p>

            <p> Mr. THOMAS desired that the appropriation be continued, and hoped that the members
              would not cut off the same.</p>

            <p> Mr. PATTEN did not care how this Board of Health was killed, so it was killed. Cut
              off the appropriation and it will die. It was created for the purpose of furnishing
              statistics for certain corporations. These corporations have to have these statistics,
              and they propose to make the State furnish them. What is this State Board of Health
              and what has it done? It is not right to appropriate this $5,000 to continue this
              thing that nobody wants. It is an outrage upon the people of the State of Indiana. One
              man has the power to make or damn every physician in the State.</p>

            <p> Mr. PRICE thought the House should proceed cautiously in adopting the amendment. He
              was not fully satisfied with the workings of the Board so far himself, but he desired
              to see a full and impartial investigation. We should vote down this amendment.</p>

            <p> Mr. BOWERS did not want to take a step backward. If the State Board of Health is not
              worth $5,000 it is not worth anything.</p>

            <p> Mr. GANTS stated that there are some objections to this Board, and were when the
              bill was passed. Quite a number of physicians were opposed to the bill who, after they
              had investigated this matter carefully, are in favor of the bill or of leaving the
              Board as it is.</p>

            <p> One gentleman said there was an object in view in passing this bill. Well are not
              all bills passed for an object? And the object of this bill was to protect the people.
              He referred to vaccination and every man knows that vaccination is for the protection
              of the community and family.</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. GORDON the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 64; nays,
              27.</p>

            <p> The House took a recess until 2 o'clock.</p>

            <p>Mr. DEEM made an ineffectual motion to reduce the appropriation for the State Board
              of Health from $5,000 to $2,000.</p>

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN offered the following amendment, which was adopted, to the appropriation
              for the State Board of Health; "And no more, by virtue of any former law, shall be
              appropriated than $5,000."</p>

            <p> A motion to strike out the appropriation for the Fishery Commission was laid on the
              table by yeas, 63; nays, 19.</p>

            <p> Mr. FLEECE offered an amendment to the appropriation for the House of Refuge for
              Boys, making it $60,000 instead of $50,000. He had been informed by the Manager of the
              Institution, whom he regarded a most worthy and honorable man, that $50,000 was not
              sufficient to properly conduct the Institution and furnish proper food and clothing to
              the inmates. He desired to have this appropriation raised to $60,000.</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. GORDON the amendment was laid on the table.</p>

            <p> Mr. CAMPBELL made an ineffectual motion to increase the appropriation for the
              "Institution for Women and Girls," from $30,000 to $35,000.</p>

            <p> He also made an ineffectual motion to strike out the following words: "But no person
              receiving a salary from the State or any of its institutions shall be paid additional
              compensation from this fund."</p>

            <p> Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, offered an amendment, which was agreed to, to insert the
              words, "inforce" at the time reports are delivered," after the word "law," where it
              first occurs in the following item of the appropriation bill: "For payment for volumes
              of the reports of the Supreme Court in number and prices as provided by law to be paid
              in the manner provided by law."</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. JEWETT the bill as amended was ordered engrossed.</p>

              the State of the convicts in the State Prison, and to amend Section 10 of the State
              Prison act, being Section 6,138 of the Code of l88l, so as to prevent contractors,

            <head rend="center">PURCHASE OF TOLL ROADS.</head>

            <p> Mr. Hillgass' bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_048">S. 48</ref>] providing for the
              appraisement, purchase and convertment of toll roads into free roads, was read the
              third time. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Delaware, disliked to oppose any measure of this kind, but did not
              believe this bill would meet the wishes of its author or its friends; Under former
              laws citizens owning adjoining land were assessed heavily for building roads, and some
              roads constructed never have paid a dividend. The proposition now is to reassess these
              very same lands for the purchase of these roads. This is manifestly unjust. The bill
              also provides that a majority of these landholders shall first petition for the
              purchase, thus making the bill in-operative and ineffective, because you can not
              procure the petition of these men to assess themselves. He favored a bill to allow the
              purchase of gravel and Other toll roads and their conversion into free roads.</p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS insisted the reference to an old law inoperative was not pertinent to
              this bill. That is no reason why the proposed bill should not be practicable. This
              bill has had the careful consideration of some of the best lawyers in his District. If
              the people along the line of pike, within the limit of three miles, are willing their
                <pb n="168" xml:id="VAA8558-21-167"/> real estate should be taxed for its purchase,
              surely no one should stand in the way. He cited instances where farmers pay more than
              four or five years than the assessment on their land would be to purchase the road and
              convert it into a free gravel road. The limit to payout these bonds under the bill is
              ten years. It applies to all land within a mile and a half on either side, and within
              the beginning and the terminus of the line.</p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH, of Jay, also hoped the bill would pass. It affects no law concerning
              gravel roads now on the statute books. In his County there is a six mile road from the
              County seat which the people desire to connect with another road and convert this toll
              into a free gravel road. For this and other reasons he hoped this measure will
              prevail.</p>

            <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS feared that under this bill non-paying roads would have an advantage
              in selling non-productive roads to County Boards and thus make the land alongside pay
              twice-once for the original construction, and then again for the purchase of the same
              roads. He objected to this double assessment as not fair or just.</p>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGASS saw no argument against the passage of this bill in what had been
              said. Where owners of land are wiling to encumber their real estate to purchase gravel
              roads running alongside the Legislature should not object.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY objected to this bill in Section 2 where it provides for a wrong system of
              appraisement. As has been said frequently such stock is literally worth nothing in the
              market. The bill provides the assessment shall be at what it would cost to build the
              road, while the stock in the market may be worthless. </p>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGASS: You forget the fact that if the owners and purchasers agree on a
              price it is a matter entirely with them.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY: That is the difficulty. There may be ten men living along the road who
              have bought up the stock at ten cents on the $100, and under this bill they would take
              out the pockets of their neighbors what it would cose to out the road there. The
              assessment should be the value of the stock.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN thought the Senator from Madison [Mr. Henry] had the wrong theory. He
              favored the bill.</p>

            <p> Mr. FOULKE: The theory advanced by the Senator from Henry is undoubtedly correct,
              but the bill provides the case value of the road is to be determined. In determining
              the rent of a house not rentable for a percent, on the cost of construction it would
              not be valued at the cost of putting it up; and so it will be with assessments made
              under this bill.</p>

            <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS moved to postpone indefinitely the further consideration of the
              bill.</p>

            <p> This motion was rejected by yeas, 3; nays, 33.</p>

            <p> Mr. FOULKE moved to recommit the bill to a Committee of One, with instructions to
              strike out the words "bridges and culverts," and "provided that the finding of the
              Court shall be final." There is no more reason why the finding of the Court should be
              final in this case than in cases where any other equitable relief is asked.</p>

            <p> The motion was rejected.</p>

            <p> Mr. CAMPBELL explained, while he desired some such measure should receive the
              approval of the General Assembly there were inequitable provisions in this bill which
              compelled his negative vote.</p>

            <p> The bill failed to pass for want of a Constitutional majority-yeas, 21; nays,

            <p>Mr. YANCEY regarded it almost impossible to fence land with growing crops thereon

              before the Senate last session, at which time it was pretty thoroughly discussed, and
              the need of such a law is pretty generally recognized.</p>

              <p>Mr. Johnson's bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_102">S. 102</ref>] to amend
                Sections <unclear reason="faded">[?]</unclear> and 4 of an act to provide for the
                organization and support of the Asylum for the Feeble Minded Children. [For the
                reorganization of said institution-the Board to hold two for four years and one for
                one year; to have, also, control of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home.] It was read for
                the third time.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN moved to make this bill a special order for Friday at 11:15 o'clock.</p>

              <p> This motion was rejected by yeas, 25; nays, 18, for want of a two-thirds vote.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN believed this the law of 1879 increasing the salary to $500. He opposed
                the bill on the ground of economy. From Rush County there comes here one of these
                Trustees who says he is securing enough money for the labor he is performing, saving
                it would be an iniquity and unjust to pay the Trustees any more. Mr. Spann opposed
                the bill of 1879 because it destroyed the Soldiers' Home, wiped out its distinctive
                features, and made it subservient to the feeble minded and idiotic children of
                Indiana, making them subservient to the small-headed idiots of the State. A
                Republican Trustee of this Institution has been upon the floor of this Senate
                demanding that this bill shall not be passed, because the money paid to him is
                enough and more than enough to pay for the services rendered. He wanted it to go out
                to the country that the Democracy are anxious to raise salaries of these Trustees in
                the face of these statements.<pb n="169" xml:id="VAA8558-21-168"/> He never would
                east a vote that would put to shame the soldiers and soldiers' orphans of Indiana or
                elsewhere. He demanded the previous question.</p>

              <p> The demand for the previous question was seconded-yeas, 36; nays, 9-and under its
                operation-</p>

              <p>The bill passed by yeas, 26; nays, 19.</p>

              <p>Mr. HILLIGAS3 voting therefor, with the understanding that the bill does not
                increase the pay of Trustees.</p>

              <p>Mr BROWN moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed and to lay the
                motion to reconsider on the table.</p>

              <p>The latter motion was agreed to by yeas, 25; nays, 16. </p>

              <p>Mr. MARVIN, recognizing the importance of immediate action on this bill, moved for
                a dispensation of the Constitutional rule that the bill may be pressed to its
                passage now. This money was appropriated two years ago, but for some reason has not
                been used and the money is doing nobody any good. </p>

              <p>The motion was rejected-yeas, 25; nays, 35. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD, explaining his negative vote: He is willing to grant everything

              <p> The PRESIDENT pro tem. [Mr. Spann in the Chair] announced the order of the day-the
                consideration of the bill pending at the adjournment yesterday [<ref
                  target="#SB_1883_01_04_006">S. 6</ref>] to provide for the election and
                appointment of Supervisors of Highways.</p>

              <p>Mr. WHITE moved to insert "ten" instead of "eight hours" in Section 6 for a day's
                work. </p>

              <p>It was agreed to.</p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE moved to strike out the words "and under fifty years" in Section 6. He
                knew no reason why a man over fifty years of age should not work on the road. </p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH of Jay, moved to amend the amendment by inserting the words "Under sixty
                years of age." </p>

              <p>Mr. DAVIDSON and Mr. HILLIGASS opposed both the amendments. Men over fifty who have
                been exempt should, not be again brought back to road work. " </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY favored the amendment. </p>

              <p>The amendment to the amendment was rejected by yeas, 6; nays, 28. </p>

              <p>The amendment was also rejected.</p>

              <p>Mr. HILLIGASS made an ineffectual motion to strike out the last words in Section 6,
                viz.; "Although such person may be in some respects deformed." </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY moved to amend Section 7 by inserting the word "mule" and the words "road
                scraper or road scoop."</p>

              <p>Mr. RAHM favored the mule part of the amendment inasmuch as there are but few
                horses or oxen in his County. </p>

              <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY moved to amend Section 2 by adding a proviso preventing voting for a Road
                Supervisor in any other District than the one in which the voter resides.</p>

              <p> The amendment was agreed to.</p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS moved to amend by inserting $1.50 instead of $1 per day wherever it
                occurs in Section 10.</p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY moved to make it $1.25.</p>

              <p> Mr. WILLARD opposed both amendments.</p>

              <p> Mr. RAHM did not believe in starving a man on $1 a day; $1.25 is little
                enough.</p>

              <p> The amendment to the amendment [Mr. Henry's] was agreed to, and the amendment as
                amended was also agreed to.</p>

              <p> On motion by Mr. VAN VORHIS $1 was made to read $1.25 in Section 11.</p>

              <p> On motion by Mr. HENRY 25 "was inserted after the word dollar" in section 13.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY moved to amend Section 15 so as to give credit for the same class of
                work done by inserting the words "similar extra" after the word "subsequent."</p>

              <p> It was agreed to.</p>

              <p> Mr. ADK1NSON moved to strike from Section 16 the words: "Unless he should deem
                them unreasonable, in which case he may reduce the amount"-striking out this
                discretion. The Supervisor with the disinterested persons are better qualified to
                judge in such cases than the Trustees.</p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE thought this feature may be unconstitutional, though favoring the
                amendment. </p>

              <p>Mr. HOWARD offered a substitute by providing that appeal may be made to the Circuit
                Court in the question of damages. </p>

              <p>Mr. ADKISON made the point of order that the substitute is not germane. </p>

              <p>The PRESIDENT pro tem [Mr. Spann in the Chair] sustained the point of order.</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr VAN VORHIS this section was referred to the Senator from Crawford
                [Mr. Benz] with instructions to amend as suggested by Mr. Magee. That there should

            <p>Mr. McMULLEN, for the. majority of the <orgName>Committee on Judiciary</orgName>,
              reported to the House the Neal &amp; Co. claim with the recommendation that the bill
              in relation to said claim and accompanying the report pass. Mr. McMullen explained
              that the bill reported empowered the claimants to file their complaint against the
              provisional Board of Commissioners for the Indiana Hospital for the Insane in the
              Superior Court of Marion County, and provides further for an appeal, and especially
              provides that the Court shall not be allowed to render any judgment against the State,
              but that the Hading of the Court under the bill when made shall be referred to this or
              the next General Assembly, and nothing paid there- on until such Assembly indorses and
              allows said claim. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN presented a minority report from the same Committee, recommending that the
              bill be indefinitely postponed. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILES moved the adoption of the minority report.</p>

            <p>Mr. STEWART said: "It seems to me that the majority report ought to prevail. Here are
              men 'who claim that they entered into a contract with the State to do certain work,
              and these men claim that they did the heavy part of the work-the part on which they
              could not realize any profit and then the light work, and that on which they expected
              to realize the profit for the entire work was refused them because of the
              modifications made by the architect. Now these men want a trill passed that will allow
              them to go into Court and present their claim against the State. This bill does not
              grant their claim; It simply gives thee men an opportunity to go into Court and let
              the Court say whether or not there is anything due these men from the State; and if,
              after a fair 'hearing, the Court decides that there is any money coming to the men,
              then the next Legislature will be called upon to grant or refuse this claim. If these
              men have a just claim let the 'Court so say, and if they have no just claim that will
              be the end of it. </p>

            <p>Mr. ADAMS stated that the minority report was made as they claimed upon the
              provisions of the contract; that the provisions of the contract al- lowed the
              modification which the architect made, and this the gentlemen knew when they accepted
              this contract. Now these gentlemen should have looked to this matter before accepting
              this contract, provided they were capable of making such contract, find he believed
              they were. This minority report should be concurred in, or else we should make
              provision for a guardian for these gentlemen. </p>

            <p> Mr. GIBSON was of the opinion that these gentlemen desired to get a judicial
              construction on this claim, and then come before the Legislature and say, Is this
              Legislature going back on the claims that the Court has decided legal? </p>

            <p>Mr. WILEY said: Mr. Speaker. I am heartily in favor of concurring in the minority
              report. As a member of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> I signed the report,
              and believing now as I did the a that this Legislature should do nothing that will
              permit any favored class or company of men to bring an I action against the State for
              alleged damage upon breach of contract, I am opposed to the bill. I have two reasons
              for my opposition.</p>

            <p>1. Under Section 24 of Article 4 of the Constitution, just referred to by me
              gentleman from dark, the bill, if passed, would, in my opinion, be clearly
              unconstitutional, for the Constitution plainly says: "But no special act authorizing
              such suit (suit against the State) to be brought, or making compensation to any person
              claiming damages against the State, shall ever be passed." It is she intent of this
              bill to permit Messrs. Neal, Dodd &amp; Co. to bring such action against the State,
              and hence for that reason I am opposed to it.</p>

            <p>2. The alleged claim of Messrs. Neal, Dodd &amp; Co. is based upon a statement of
              facts, which if true and the bill should pass, the claim could not be enforced a law. </p>

            <p>It could not be enforced because it is based upon what our Courts have been pleased
              to denominate "speculative damages," and has been frequently held by our Supreme Court
              that this class of damages can not be enforced. </p>

            <p>In short, the bill seeks to make the possible profits of the contract of Neal, Dodd
              &amp; Go. with the State a measure of damages, when that contract was broken, by
              virtue of its own provisions, and such profits can not be the measure of damages, for
              it is contrary to public policy and ban been so held. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT stated that the objections urged by members on the floor against this bill
              were considered by the Committee, and was the reason why the gentlemen had submitted
              the minority report. He did not think that the House should attempt to decide this
              Constitutional question. These gentlemen do not ask the Legislature to pay them any
              special amount of money. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, (interrupting) asked Mr. Jewett if he knew the amount of these
              claims. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT did not know, and did not think the matter of paying an honest claim
              should depend upon the amount of the claim. </p>

            <p>Mr. GORDON thought it was but fair to suppose that this Provisional Board acted fair
              about this matter, and it is but fair to believe that this Board had better knowledge
              of the facts than any Board or any Court that might be called upon to settle the fact
              of his claim. </p>

            <p>Mr. ANTRIM said because differences arise between parties leading to litigation it
              does not follow that either party is dishonest. Because those contractors claim that
              the State owes them money it does not follow that they are dishonest, nor does it
              follow because these claims are not paid that the Provisional Board is dishonest. Now,
              this bill does not propose to pay the contractors one cent. it simply proposes to
              allow them an opportunity to prove their claim, and if they establish their claim the
              next General Assembly max or may not make appropriations for the payment of said
              claims. I see nothing unfair in this. It is just and right, gentlemen, being that if
              the contractors establish their claim the State will have to pay the cost of the suit.
              This the State should do if It owes these men and compels them to go into Court to
              establish their claim. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELEY thought that the claims should have been referred to the
                <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>
              <pb n="171" xml:id="VAA8558-21-170"/>and allowed this Committee to have made a
              thorough investigation.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIA.M8, of Knox, said: Mr. Speaker, I signed this minority report, and I am
              glad of it. The gentlemen who favor this majority report and advocate the payment of
              the Neal claim have talked a great deal about it, and the lobby is a most persistent
              and impudent one. In my five minutes I can not review this subject fully, but I wish
              to call the attention of the House to a few facts which the greedy advocates of this
              grab have failed to give us, but which are, nevertheless, facts that can not be
              disputed. In the first place this bill is in direct conflict with Section 24, Article
              4. of the State Constitution, which rightly and expressly prohibits the General
              Assembly from passing any special act authorial suits to be brought against the State.
              The bill under consideration is a special bill for the benefit of Neal &amp; Co. The
              fact is that Neal &amp; Co. have been fully paid in cash for every dollar's worth of
              labor and materials furnished by them to the State. This claim, enormous in amount and
              extraordinary in character, is purely and entirely for speculative damages. It is not
              claimed that Neal &amp; Co. lost any money on their contract with the State. It is not
              claimed that the State in any way violated the letter or spirit of the written
              contract made with Neal &amp; Co. It is true that desiring the progress of the work
              some modifications were, with the knowledge and consent of Neal &amp; Co., made in the
              contract, but, Mr. Speaker, in the original contract the State reserved the right to
              modify it, Neal &amp; Co. assented to the changes and completed the work and got every
              dollar due them. It simmers down to this, that this is a claim for additional profits
              which they might have made upon this work if they had been working under a more
              liberal contract. They made money, but are sorry they did not make more. The gentleman
              from Kosciusko says Neal &amp; Co. ought to have a day in Court ought to be provided
              with a tribunal before whom they can present their claims. I say to him that the law
              has provided a Court for them. The Provisional Board is the tribunal where this now
              stale claim has had its day in Court. This Board had the power to pay this claim, it
              was their duly to pay it if it was equitable and just. The Board did examine this
              claim years ego and decided that it was without merit and refused to pay it. I hold in
              my hand an able opinion by Judge Holman In the case of the State ex rel. John Martin
              vs. Provisional Board, etc., in which the Court holds that this Board has full and
              excessive jurisdiction. The opinion says: "It must rest with tile Board, however, to
              say whether or not they will issue the warrant, and whether or not he is a bona fide
              creditor of the State, and if so to what extent, in these particulars, they are the
              Judges." Mr. Speaker, Neal &amp; Co.&amp;s claim had its day in Court; It was
              rejected, and since that time the lobby has had it in charge. I can not give a list of
              the persons to whom this money would go it its claim is paid because I do not follow
              who the members of Neal &amp; Co. are. This work was done years ago. If the claim is
              what the gentlemen from Kosciusko (Prazer) says it is, how did it happen that the
              Legislature of two years ago did not approve it? It was unnecessary to mention Mr.
              Hendricks' name here; he simply wrote the bill because he was attorney for Neal &amp;
              Co. My constituents are perhaps old fogy people. They abhor repudiation, but they are
              also opposed to the payment of a single dollar out of the public funds except there be
              a legal or equitable reason for so doing, and speaking for them, I object to this
              majority report and demand the yeas and nays upon the pending question. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH was of the opinion that we ought to establish a Court of Claims, to which
              all claims could be referred. He would not impugn any man's motives, but he thought
              thi8 question should be relegated to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, who
              should present a bill that would cover this whole question. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN desired to call things by their right names, and when he denounced this as
              a steal he meant what he said. He thought that because these gentlemen had made a bad
              contract, or a contract on which they had not realized as great a profit as they
              desired, they have appeared ere asking the members of the House to put their hands in
              the pockets of the State and pay them this extra amount. </p>

            <p>The minority report was concurred in by yeas, 75: nays, 10. </p>

            <p>The question now recurred on the majority report as amended by the minority report. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON of Marion, thought that a Judicial question of this kind should go to a
              Judicial Tribunal. The Provisional Board desired that this matter should have a fair
              and judicial investigation. This bill asks that privilege and that privilege only. If
              these gentlemen think that they can not trust the Court they had better take some
              steps to purify this Court. If a judicial investigation decides that these gentlemen
              should have this claim they will then be allowed to come before the Legislature with
              this fact. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY said: Mr. Speaker; this debate has at least resulted in changing the mind
              of the gentleman from Marion on Constitutional tribunals, and I suppose, hereafter,
              the submissionists will count on this support, as he says: "Of all bodies in the world
              the Legislature is the most unfit body to pass upon a Constitution I question " I
              think the gentleman from Knox takes the proper view of this question. Who are urging
              this bill? I will not impugn the motives of any man, but I do think that the justness
              of this claim should at least be vouched for by the friends of the bill before we
              voluntarily open the door to endless litigation. If this claim, amounting to $60,000
              or $70,000, is just and the State ought to assume the payment thereof, then,
              certainly, these contractors will meet with a respectful hearing before the
                <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>.</p>

            <p>This Committee has been provided for for this purpose, and why should this claim be
              an exception t all others? Again, Section 24, Article 4, of the Constitution of
              Indiana provides:</p>

            <p>"Sec 24 Provisions may be made by general law, for bringing suit against the State,
              as to all liabilities originating after the adoption of this Constitution; but no
              special act authorizing such suit to be brought, or making compensation to any person
              claiming damages against the State, shall ever be passed "</p>

            <p>Now, this bill proposes to do indirectly that which the Constitution provides can not
              De done directly. The bill provides that these contractors shall be authorized to go
              into Court and there establish the justness of their claim, and then with this club in
              their hands come back to the next Legislature and say, now we have a just claim. It
              had no merit four years ago; it gained none in two years, but now it is just because
              the Court to whom the last Legislature referred it, has so decided, and a refusal by
              you to make an appropriation for its payment is repudiation. I trust, gentlemen, that
              you will concur in the minority report. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT demanded the previous question which was seconded by the House, and under
              its operations the report as amended was adopted. </p>

              <p> It was announced by the Speaker that the special order for the hour was the
                Committee reports or the bill [H. R. 26] to repeal Section 6 of an act concerning
                promissory notes, etc. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, said: The principal object of this bill seems to be to
                protect those who can not protect themselves against the patent-right and hay-fork
                sharpers. It comes with humble professions of good will to the people of this State
                and a benediction upon our business interests. It would have been better to have
                entitled the bill as one to strike down all business men working on credit, to
                paralyze business at home and excite ridicule abroad! </p>

              <p>If a man of ordinary care is so stupid that he can not tell the difference between
                the promissory note payable in bank and one that is not, or a promissory note end a
                contract that is not a promissory note, he should have a guardian appointed, or he
                should interpose the defence, when sued, that he was non compos mentis, in which
                event he would escape liability. If he does not exercise ordinary care, then it ill
                becomes this Legislature to protect him against his own folly, and at the same time,
                while thus encouraging carelessness, break in upon a law, the practical value of
                which to the business world has been attested by the experience of centuries.</p>

              <p>Under the law as it now stands a third party can not recover on a promissory note
                payable in bank, unless he gets it before maturity, bona fide, in the ordinary
                course of business, for a valuable consideration and without knowledge of defence to
                the same; even when so gotten he can not recover if it was forged, procured by
                duress, executed by one under disabilities, or for a consideration prohibited by
                statute. This is enough. </p>

              <p>The repeal of the present law will do no good and must do infinite harm.</p>

              <p>The stupid innocent who can not tell what he is doing will be induced to accept
                bills of exchange or indorse them, or to put his name on a blank paper, which will
                blossom into a bill of exchange; or he will sign a promissory note as heretofore,
                not payable in a bank in Indiana, but payable in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio or
                Illinois; this will be governed by the law of the plea of payment. So you will not
                protect those you seek to protect. </p>

              <p>But you will do harm. You repeal a law which had its origin from the inexorable
                demands of business; had its origin from the usages and customs of merchants; a law
                that is recognized in every civilized country on the face of the earth as of
                practical value in business. Without it you cannot issue and negotiate a single bond
                (for they are but promissory notes); without such negotiable bonds (unless payable
                out of the State) what building enterprise of any magnitude can be ventuted on? You
                will drive capital out of the State; what credit will be gives by a business man
                when he <pb n="173" xml:id="VAA8558-21-172"/> knows he can not get a bank to
                discount the paper? What bank will be anxious to loan money directly when it can not
                dispose of the paper? </p>

              <p> Mr. McMullen's report was rejected by yeas, 19; nays, 64. </p>

              <p>The question recurring on Mr. Stewart's report, it was concurred in by yeas, 66;
                nays, 19. </p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT moved that the bill be ordered engrossed. </p>

              <p>Mr. SHIVELEY moved to amend the bill by striking out all after the enacting clause
                and inserting in lieu new matter. </p>

            <p>The Senate returned to the consideration of Mr. Benz' bill [<ref
                target="#SB_1883_01_04_006">S. 6</ref>] pending at the time of the adjournment
              yesterday, for the election and appointment of Supervisors of Highways. [See pages 98
              and 131 of the Brevier Reports.]</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES moved to amend Section 17 by striking out the word "plantation" and
              inserting in lieu the words "real estate."</p>

            <p> It was agreed to.</p>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGASS moved to amend Section 20 by inserting the words "not more than forty"
              instead of "not less than twenty-five" because there are many Townships which do not
              require a levy of even twenty-five cents tax for road purposes.</p>

            <p> It was adopted.</p>

            <p> Mr. MACARTNEY moved to amend Section 20 by adding no Supervisor shall issue a
              receipt for work done by himself, directly or indirectly, except to the amount of his
              own road tax, and no Treasurer shall receive receipts for work done other than by the
              parties presenting the same. This is to prevent throwing road receipts on the market
              by persons working out the tax of non-resident land-owners and then selling the
              receipts therefor.</p>

            <p> It was adopted.</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. HILLIGASS the words "twenty-five cents" were added after the word
              "dollar" in Section 20.</p>

            <p> Mr. SAYRE moved to add to Section 20 a proviso that road tax shall not be assessed
              against any incorporated town or city. He stated reasons why this amendment should be
              adopted.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES thought a section that town Marshals should have the same powers as
              Supervisors should be added to this bill rather than this amendment.</p>

            <p> Mr. SAYRE would not object, and withdrew his amendment.</p>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON moved to add " if presented during the year or the year following in
              which the labor is performed" [referring to road labor receipts] it was agreed to. </p>

            <p>Mr. HOOVER moved to Insert appropriately the words "between the months of April and
              October." [When-road tax must be worked out.] </p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN thought it wrong to say when this work shall be done. In his part of the
              County this restriction has never bees carried out.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY suggested the same kind of a pro vision is in Section 29. </p>

            <p> Mr. HOOVER withdrew his amendment.</p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY moved to amend Section 18 by making the regulations for opening of highways
              the same as in Section 16.</p>

            <p> It was agreed to.</p>

            <p> Mr. OVERSTREET moved to amend Section 21 inserting the words "in the road district
              where levied." money shall be expended.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY opposed the amendment.</p>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY favored the amendment. Each road district should support itself.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILLARD objected to the amendment. It would not practically work well.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY offered a substitute: "For work done under the directions of the Trustee,"
              instead of the words, "as the highways in their respective districts may require."</p>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGASS opposed the substitute.</p>

            <p> The substitute was adopted.</p>

            <p> Mr. JOHNSON moved to add to Section 21 a clause to authorize the Supervisor to
              require the owner of land to keep open a good ditch where necessary on the line of
              highway.</p>

            <p> It was rejected.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES moved to amend Section 22 by inserting in lieu of the word "same," in
              line one, these words: "Work contemplated in the last preceding section of this
              act."</p>

            <p> It was adopted.</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. HENRY Section 23 was stricken from the bill.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY moved to amend Section 29 by striking out all between the word "Auditor"
              in line 3, and before the word "all" in line 5, and inserting "such Trustee shall
              cause the same to be expended during the year in which it is received." and striking
              out all after the word, "year" in line 7.</p>

            <p> It was agreed to.</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. HENRY Section 20 was amended by inserting in line 4 after the word
              "Township" the words: "outside of the incorporated cities and towns," so as to make it
              uniform to the amendment just adopted in Section 29.</p>

            <p> The Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS moved to amend Section 24 by adding a proviso that the Justice shall
              tax where judgment is rendered, $6 for attorney's fee as plaintiff's attorney, where
              suit is instituted for destroying guide boards or injuring and obstructing highways,
              ditch, dam, etc., etc. In the past Supervisors would not often prosecute for such
              damage from the fact that he would have to pay attorney's fees out of his own pocket.
              The punishment is not too severe.</p>

            <p> Mr. McINTOSH opposed the amendment, believing it would encourage malicious
              prosecutions. The Supervisors have been able to get along heretofore without such a
              clause, He deprecated the encouragement of strife.</p>

            <p> The amendment was agreed upon a division-affirmative, 8; negative, 6.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY moved to amend Section 20 by substituting the word "Trustee" for the word
              "Supervisor" in line 9.</p>

            <p> It was agreed to-affirmative, 13; negative, 6.</p>

            <p> Mr. RISTINE moved a substitute for Section 22, making it more explicit as to what
              the Trustee shall do.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES considered the section well enough as it stands.</p>

            <pb n="176" xml:id="VAA8558-21-175"/>

            <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS insisted there should be some intelligent basis for a proposed
              contract, and favored the substitute.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to lay the substitute on the table. </p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. HENRY this vote was reconsidered. </p>

            <p>The substitute was rejected.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES offered an additional section, concerning the keeping of streets, alleys,
              etc., in order, in which the Trustees are given the same power as Township Trustees,
              and Marshals the same power as Supervisors of Roads, etc. Tax levies by Township
              Trustees not to apply to town property, etc.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY offered a substitute declaring the provisions of this act shall not apply
              to incorporated towns and cities.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES explained his sections would bring the streets and alleys of towns and
              cities under the same system of improvement as the roads and highways of the State.
              His Circuit Judge held there was no law to compel work on streets or alleys of cities
              and towns.</p>

            <p>Mr. SAYRE stated objections to the amendment and to the substitute. </p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS favored the amendment.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY insisted no answer has been made to his objection to the amendment.</p>

            <p>The substitute was rejected-yeas, 15: nays, 20. </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY made an ineffectual motion to lay the amendment on the table.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL insisted if every law on the subject of working roads were wiped out, cities
              would still have power to construct and repair streets and alleys. </p>

            <p>Mr. BENZ moved to amend the amendment by authorizing: towns and cities to avail
              themselves of the benefit of the provisions of this act by en- acting proper
              ordinances, </p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY offered a substitute for the amendment to the amendment by changing the
              terms of the original amendment in the third clause or section thereof, so that cities
              and towns may order road tax worked out within the limits thereof. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES opposed the amendment proposed by the Senator from Crawford [Mr.
              Benz.]</p>

            <p>The amendment as amended by the substitute was agreed to. </p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY offered an additional section abolishing the office of Road Master and Road
              Superintendent-the object being to protect Road Superintendents who have advanced
              money for the purpose of putting roads in repair, so their legal claims shall be paid. </p>

            <p>It was adopted.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE offered a substitute for the section proposed by him and adopted yesterday,
              embodying its terms with a provision in addition for an appeal to the Circuit Court
              under the rules governing appeals from Justices' Courts.</p>

            <p>It was adopted. </p>

            <p>Mr. DUNCAN offered an additional section securing credit for all outstanding orders
              and road receipts. He desired to see persons protected who have already worked out
              their road tax. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD regarded this as <unclear reason="faded/missing">[?]totology</unclear>-as
              that has already been provided for in the last section offered by the Senator from
              Madison [Mr. Henry].</p>

            <p>The additional section [Mr. Duncan's] was rejected.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE offered an additional section requiring all highways, hereafter to be
              established, 'to be of the width of not less than forty feet. </p>

            <p>It was adopeted. </p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY offered an additional section. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD made an ineffectual motion to lay it on the table.</p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY explained his proposed section-if persons are willing to donate one-half of
              the expense necessary to make good public highways the Trustee shall perform work
              thereon equal in value. </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL favored this additional section. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES also. Where public enterprise of this kind is shown it ought to be
              encouraged. </p>

            <p>Mr. NULL favored the amendment to the bill as proposed by this additional section. </p>

            <p>Mr. ADKISON desired to see it adopted.</p>

            <p>The additional section was adopted. </p>

            <p>Mr. SAYRE moved to amend Section 20 by requiring the Auditor to deliver to the
              Township Trustee a list of road tax assessed against each person in his district.</p>

            <p>It was adopted.</p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, moved to reconsider the vote by which an amendment was adopted
              declaring the width of highways hereafter established shall net be less than forty
              feet.</p>

            <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH favored the motion. He thought such a clause in this bill would be
              unconstitutional. There is no need of raising that question, especially as it is
              desirable in some places that the road shall not be over thirty feet in width. </p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE insisted forty feet is none too wide for public roads. Where a ditch has to
              be built on either side of the road, certainly it is none too little. He saw no force
              in the Constitutional objection just urged. This provision of the bill ought to be
              retained. </p>

            <p>The motion to reconsider was agreed to.</p>

            <p>The question recurring on the amendment [Mr. Magee's]-Mr. VOYLES did not think this
              cause would endanger the Constitutionality of the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH insisted there could not be a misdemeanor act incorporated in an act
              concerning Supervisors.</p>

            <p>The amendment [Mr. Magee's] requiring all highways hereafter constructed to be of the
              width of forty feet, was rejected.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD, as a report of a Special Committee [Mr. Benz's], submitted an amendment
              adding to Section 16 a proviso concerning appeals.</p>

            <p>It was adopted. </p>

            <p>Mr. BENZ offered a a additional section embracing an emergency clause.</p>

            <p>It was adopted by yeas, 22; nays, 16. </p>

            <p>Mr. SAYRE moved as a new section assigning the construction and keeping in repair of

            <p>Mr. SPANN, when his name was called, said: I will vote against this bill for one
              reason-because, of a political necessity, it proposes to legislate out of office Dr.
              Freeman, of Union County, a gentleman appointed by the Governor of Indiana to serve a
              certain term and length of time. There have been no charges made against him on
              account of inefficiency, but he is to be legislated out of office because of a
              political necessity. I will vote against this bill because Dr. Freeman was a soldier
              in the War of the Rebellion; was wounded at Chickamauga; was shot through the body and
              lay on the battlefield three days, then was carried to a Hospital and lay on his back
              for six months. His case is reported in medical journals as being one of the most
              remarkable cases in the History of surgery. I desire to call attention to the fact
              that by the passage of this bill that man who has such a noble record Roes down in the
              dust under this bill, after having served his country so faithfully and that
              Institution so honestly. Therefore, I vote "no." </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, said: The Senator

              will remind him that a few days since, when a Democratic soldier with an armless
              sleeve was a candidate for Door-keeper, the Senator from Rush loudly and vindictively
              voted against him. So it is not the soldier so much with the Senator after all; with
              him it depends on whose political ox is being gored. This is the explanation of my
              vote. I vote "aye." </p>

            <p>The vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>

            <p> So the bill passed.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed, and to lay the
              motion to reconsider on the table.</p>

            <p>This latter motion was rejected. </p>

            <head rend="center">DIRECTORS OF THE NORTHERN PRISON.</head>

            <p> Mr. MAGEE called up another special order, being Mr. Hutchinson's bill [<ref
                target="#SB_1883_01_04_050">S. 50</ref>-see page 162 of the Brevier Reports]
              concerning the official terms of the Directors of the Northern Prison, the question
              being on its final passage in the Senate, </p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL said: My greatest objection to the passage of this bill is that it does
              nothing but perpetuate the life of the Directors who have been lately elected: and it
              makes no provision for ever electing anybody else to succeed them. When I offered the
              substitute for this bill (which was voted down) I incorporated therein the four-year
              term contemplated In the bill, thereby re-organizing and conceding the efficiency
              which may be gained by experience, and that a four years' term in office is
              desireable. I, however, desired that because of the value of experience, one of the
              present Incumbents may be retained for the two-year term, but this substitute was
              voted down. Notwithstanding this I till say I have no objection to extending the
              office of the Directors from two to four years, and should vote for tills bill if it
              was for that purpose and drafted to that effect, but it is not. The bill prolongs the
              term of office of the recently elected Directors, and nothing else. It snakes no
              provision for the election of any successors, and if it is contemplated that
              successors shall ever be elected, it gives no directions how, or for what length of
              time the successors are to be elected, and hence, if elected at all, it would have to
              be by the present law and for two years as now; and hence, while I would willingly
              vote for a bill making the Directors and their successors terms of office four years,
              I am opposed to this bill which has no object or effect except to prolong the terms of
              the present elected Directors, and theirs only. </p>

            <p>The bill passed by yeas, 27; nays, 20. </p>

              <head rend="center">DECEDENTS' ESTATES.</head>

              <p> Mr. BUNDY called up the special order, the bill [S. 262] concerning decedents'
                estates.</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. HENRY an addition was made to Section 20, in the way of a proviso,
                that, where an account is filed and no notice of the "hearing of the same is
                required, it shall not be necessary for the Clerk to fix a day in the future for the
                hearing thereof, but the same may be acted on at any time by the Court."</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. COMPTON, Section 115 of said act was amended so that notice of the
                pendency of the petition and of the time and place of hearing shall be given by
                publication for three weeks successively in some newspaper printed and pub<pb
                  n="181" xml:id="VAA8558-21-180"/>lished in the County in which the administration
                of the estate is pending, if any be published therein, and if not then in some
                public newspaper printed and published nearest thereto in this State. At least ten
                days before the time set for hearing said petition the notice herein provided for
                shall be issued by the Clerk of the Court, attested by his signature and seal of the
                Court. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD would like to have the changes proposed by this bill explained. It is
                almost impossible without a printed copy for members to know what the changes or
                alterations are. </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY explained: Everything in regard to a Master Commissioner is stricken out;
                if those words have been left in it is an overright. In regard to the filing and
                allowance of claims provision is made that any person having a claim against a
                decedent shall make out a statement, as provided in the present law, and file the
                same with the executor, administrator or in the Clerk's office, giving the claimant
                the option; the administrator or executor reports to the Court as in other matters
                relating to the estate. When allowed by the administrator or executor either on the
                appearance docket or by reporting to the Court, that is ail the action necessary. No
                presentation of claims, as now provided, is necessary. If not allowed the claim goes
                on the issue docket for trial, as in the former law-not under the present law.
                Exactly the same pro-provision as In the former law is provided for the claim of the
                administrator himself. Also where anyone desires to litigate, if the administrator
                does not, with an additional provision that he shall file a bond and made liable tor
                costs unless he reduces the claim 10 per cent. This bill dose away with cash
                accounts, which is required to be filed every six months under the present law. In
                place of that, at the end of the year, or as soon as the sale notes mature, he is
                required to make a report, as now required at the end of the year, with the
                additional provision that he shall report what claims have been presented to him for
                allowance or what he has concluded not to allow. That provision is exactly like the
                wording in the voluntary, assignment law in regard to claims, winch is very
                simple-the Committee thinking it better to take a practice that is familiar. That
                report is acted upon by the Court. It is a final report. In regard to notice, notice
                must be given if it is a final report as provided by the present law; that is notice
                by publication-not by summons. It does away with all notice by summons as under the
                present law. On final settlement he is to give notice, but on current report not.
                Under the old law no current report could be made final, even as to matters involved
                in it. If, in the judgment of the administrator, the account is of enough importance
                to require final action of the Court, then notice shall be given. That is the only
                notice required on current report. That is intended to meet the requirements of
                large estates and for the administrator to protect itself. When the time arrives
                under the notice it is heard. The amendment offered by the Senator from Clay [Mr.
                Compton] goes to the notice and does away with personal summons. [It is printed
                above.] The old clause is left in this bill providing for the opening up of accounts
                for fraud or mistake within three years. It requires the administrator and the Judge
                to inquire diligently into all claims, and makes them responsible for any damages
                resulting fro m neglect of that duty. When an estate is clearly solvent the
                administrator can pay a claim at any time when he has the money. On final settlement
                the Court may order him to pay out or pay into the Court. There was a defect in the
                old law, which allowed heirs or legatees to apply for a distributive share when
                required for their support. In this bill that limiting clause is stricken out. Then
                this bill makes this change: The Committee thinking it right that where there must
                be any litigation over a case one trial should end it, have provided that where a
                claim is not allowed, and there are other parties bound on the same contract with
                the decedent, the Court will order the claim amended, and have the other, the living
                party, brought into Court. Another provision is that a mortgage or either lien can
                lot be foreclosed as against the heirs until a year has expired from the taking out
                of the letters of administration and giving of notice. </p>

              <p>The bill was then considered as engrossed and read the third time, and passed by
                yeas, 44; nays, 0. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE explaining the Pittsburg, Cincinnati and St. Louis desire to lay another
                track: along side these grounds, and seven and half feet is all it requires for that
                purpose. The Trustees of the Institution desire some kind of a wall built to make
                the ground safe against reaching out, etc., and to protect the property.</p>

              <p>Mr VAN VORHIS doubted the wisdom of this measure.</p>

              <p>Mr. FLETCHER had examined in to this matter, and believes there is a necessity for
                a wall to be built along there to prevent ground from washing away. The seven feet
                is nothing, compared to the benefit to be derived from having a good wall built
                there. </p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS, in explanation of his negative vote, said this is the first he had
                heard of this proposition, and it is a little strange that members from this County
                know nothing about it. Knowing nothing of the merits of the case, he voted "no."

              <head rend="center">DESCENT OF HEIRS.</head>

              <p> The bill [H. R. 30] to amend Section 8 of an aot regulating descent of heirs,
                approved March 2, 1855, was read the third time.</p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT stated that when he examined the bill it appeared to him that the bill
                had been drawn for a particular case. He meant no offense by such a statement. He
                believed that it wax unnecessary legislation; that we are trying to do by
                legislation what the parents can do at present by their own action if they desire. </p>

              <p>Mr. FRAZER explained that under the present law if a person adopt a child and then
                die, that the property went to the adopted child. He con<pb n="183"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-21-182"/>sidered this proper and as it should be, but he did not
                think it proper if that adopted child died without children, that this property
                should go to the family of the adopted child. He thought that the estate should
                revert to the family or the relatives of the person who had adopted the child. Mr.
                Frazer cited a case where a child was adopted and the person who adopted the child
                died. The adopted child died soon after and the mother of the child came in
                afterward and sued for and recovered from the persons who held the estate several
                thousand dollars, and who were the proper heirs. He argued that where the adopted
                child died without wife or without husband or children, then the property should go
                back to the family or relatives of the person who adopted the child. </p>

              <p>Mr. STEWART thought that if a family adopted a child, thus making it their own, it
                should have all the rights and privileges of an own child. People generally adopt a
                child with the understanding that that child may inherit their property, and it
                would not be just to take from them this right.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, thought that, under the present law, a person who adopted a
                child was adopting the whole family. Mr. Wilson cited a case similar to that cited
                by Mr Frazer: Where an adopted child died and its mother came in and brought suit
                for the property that would have fallen to the adopted child had it not died. He
                thought the bill was a wise one, and favored its passage. </p>

              <p>Mr. ADAMS and Mr. GIBSON favored the pass- age of the bill. </p>

              <p>The bill passed by yeas, 73; nays, 11. </p>

                Forty-third Judicial Circuit, was read the time.</p>

              <p>Mr. ADAMS stated that he did not desire to make a speech on the bill, but desired
                to state to the House that he knew concerning the necessity of this bill. In a
                recent conversation with the Judge of this Circuit he learned that at the close of
                the last term of Court the business pending was greater than at the beginning of the
                term. He considered it a matter of economy that the bill should pass. </p>

              <p>Mr. HELMS desired to state that he was in favor of this bill. He had been
                petitioned by the entire Bar of his County with one exception to work for the
                passage of this bill. He was informed by an attorney of the Bar that the Court was
                more than a year behind. He hoped that the bill would pass. </p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH also favored the passage of the bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. PATTEN stated that the Court was very much behind, and it was a matter of
                necessity that the bill pass. </p>

              <p>The bill passed by yeas, 75; nays, 10. </p>

                homestead exempting it from sale on execution, and exempting certain personal
                property, was read the third time.</p>

              <p>Mr. HEFFREN did not know why the House should enact class legislation. He was
                opposed to class legislation, and ho was not aware that one debt was any more sacred
                than another. There is already in the statute books a law by which mechanics can put
                liens upon property. This bill does not give them any more rights, in fact, not so
                many. </p>

              <p>Mr. PATTEN thought the gentlemen [Mr. Heffren] was wrong. The bill is simply to
                protect laboring men, and to enable small property holders to secure the necessary
                labor, which they can not do at present, because they have not the re- quired amount
                of property to make them amenable to the law. It is simply right that when a man
                performs a day's labor he should have wages for it. </p>

            <head rend="center">TEACHER'S LICENSE.</head>

            <p> On motion by Mr. WHITE, his graded teacher's license bill [<ref
                target="#SB_1883_01_04_145">S. 145</ref>-see pp. 72 and 73 of the Brevier Reports]
              was read the third time. </p>

            <p>Mr. YANCEY opposed this bill because it prevents young people from procuring a
              license to teach school after, their first six months' license has expired. It is
              unjust to poor young people who are trying to educate themselves. It is unjust,
              unfair, and ought not to pass. </p>

            <p>Mr. WHITE did not think there was any unfairness in the bill. If young people will
              prepare themselves they can obtain a six months' license, There will be 'no trouble
              where they have the qualifications for governing a school and imparting education. He
              recited the provisions of the bill printed on page 72 of these reports. </p>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON believed that during the six months of teaching elementary branches on a
              trial license, the teacher will have ample time to qualify himself for taking a one
              year's license. If he does not qualify himself for a higher license then a six months'
              license shall not be re-issued. Other young teachers can take his place it he can not
              obtain a higher license. In the interest of schools and school teachers, also, that
              they may more thoroughly qualify themselves for their difficult and responsible task,
              this bill should pass. There is no in justice in giving this trial license but once. </p>

            <pb n="185" xml:id="VAA8558-21-184"/>

            <p>Mr. YANCY (interposing): Will it not in time cut off every young man and woman from
              educating themselves for teachers by practice? </p>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON (resuming) could not see in what respect it could; on the contrary it
              would have the effect to impel them to be diligent. </p>

            <p>Mr. YANCEY (interrupting): There are hundreds of young men and young women who get a
              certificate for six months and teach school, who have poor relatives to take care of,
              that takes all the money they can get for their support, and who have not the means
              nor the time to improve their education while holding a six months' certificate. This
              bill would take away from that class the opportunity of teaching longer.</p>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSTON (resuming) did not know whether the principle was a correct one to keep
              teachers of elementary grades at the lowest level of efficiency. This bill has been
              recommended by the Committee on Education and by the out-going and in-coming
              Superintendents of Public Instruction; and he thought it would add to the efficiency
              of teachers throughout the State. </p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL was in favor of this bill. Because of its merits one or two of his own
              bills on the same subject were laid on the table with his consent in order to give
              place to this one. He thought the Senator from Hancock [Mr. Yancey] was mistaken in
              supposing this bill might have a tendency to deprive young teachers from securing
              licenses. If the teacher of extra proficiency obtains a twenty-four or 36 months'
              license he is relieved, as is right, of the burden and inconvenience of undergoing an
              examination year after year. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, opposed the passage of the bill. If there are any class of
              professional men m the Slate being oppressed it is the Common School teacher. He
              served a term of eight years, and believes the first term under a six months' license
              was the best he ever taught. Under the present law the teacher is between two fires.
              There is a constant coming down in wages, and the fees are being increased for
              examinations and for attendance on Normal Institutes. If one attains the general
              average of 60 per cent. under the present law, teaches a good school to the
              satisfaction of the citizens of the District, that is all that ought to be required.
              This bill would drive from the profession a great many bright minds instead of giving
              encouragement to the profession.</p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS explained his negative vote by declaring this bill was in the interest
              of teachers who now hold twenty-four months' licensee as the bill does not require
              such to submit to an examination after the taking effect thereof. </p>

            <p>The bill failed to pass for want of a Constitutional majority-yeas, 21; nays, 13.

            <head rend="center">THIRTEENTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ELECTION.</head>

            <p> Mr. McCULLOUGH called up his motion, notice of which he gave on yesterday, to
              reconsider the vote of the Senate empowering the <orgName>Committee on
                Elections</orgName> to send for persons and papers necessary to a fall investigation
              of the charges of interfering with the free exercise of the elective franchise by the
              Studebaker and the Oliver Manufacturing Companies, of South Bend, is the Thirteenth
              Congressional election, by requiring their employes to vote such tickets as were
              placed in their hands by their bosses.</p>

            <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH, as Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName>, has
              received letters stating that there are fifty or sixty witnesses on one side of the
              case and has information that there are as many on the other side, and some indicate
              that there are others. It is patent on the face that an investigation would take up
              the whole time of the Committee for the remainder of the session. Then he could not
              free any good purpose such an investigation would serve. The Senate does not sit as a
              Grand Jury. If the law ha been violated on one hand or the other, it is not a question
              for the Senate to investigate; that devolves upon a different department of the
              Government. He hoped the Senate would agree to the motion to re- consider. </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE opposed the motion. Day after day we have heard on the floor of the
              Senate, from members of the other side, charges that these parties nave interfered
              with the purity of elections. We have heard it stated by Senators upon their personal
              honor, that there are instances, again and again, where men have been driven to the
              polls by these parties, to vote against their will. The demand for an Investigation
              has come from the party charged. No demand had come from Mr. Winterbotham. He
              expressly stated that he does not press an examination of the matter in Congress by
              abandoning a contest for the seat. He shrinks from an investigation. He declines to
              investigate the very charges which he makes. Now the demand comes for investigation,
              and from whom? From the parties accused of improper practices. It is asked to be
              referred to a Committee. To what Committee? To a Committee, a majority of whom are
              Democrats, and of the party which makes the accusation. These men demand investigation
              by a tribunal, even of their enemies. The Democratic party can not afford to make a
              charge of that kind, and shrink from the investigation of it. It will not do to say an
              investigation of these charges must not be had because it would require a little time
              and money. If it requires too much time to investigate them, then don't make them.
              When you charge a man with the commission of a crime, don't make it if you don't
              propose to investigate it. He insisted the investigation should go on. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN would favor the motion to reconsider on one ground, and on one ground only.
              If the charges made by Mr. Winterbotham are withdrawn from this Committee and
              retracted, then there would be some purpose in the motion. But to ask that the power
              to investigate be laid aside without a withdrawal or retraction of the charges is
              unfair and unjust. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN did not know that Mr. Winterbotham has laid any charges before the Senate
              that he asked any investigation about. The memorial he presented con talus some facts
              which nobody denies who knows anything about it. Shortly after that the Senator from
              St. Joseph [Mr. Campbell-see page 119 of these Reports] presented a memorial from some
              constituents of his asking that a Committee be appointed to investigate; and it was
              thought best that the regular standing <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName>
              should have charge of the investigation. He so voted beleiving the matter stated in
              reference to the conduct of these manufacturers at the last election was true; and
              still believed it. And his mind would not yield to any other conclusion until some
              substantial, truthful and just inquiry has been made which convinces him to the
              contrary. There need be no fear but that proof will be forthcoming abundant to sustain
              every statement he made upon the floor of the Senate and every statement contained in
              Mr. Winterbotham's memorial-[see page 33.] He was willing if this Committee can not
              get through with the investigation before the adjournment of the Senate, to continue
              it with power to sit during vacation and let its report be made to the people. He
              appreciated that had been said by the Senator from Gibson [Mr. McCullough]. The task
              is not an easy one and the time is short if a reprot is to be made during this
              session. He was willing the Committee should have exclusive jurisdiction as to how
              long it should sit during vacation, to the end that the people of Indiana may know
              whether this conduct, outrageous and infamous in its character, is true or false. </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL, as a member of the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName>, explained his
              position. This Committee has<pb n="186" xml:id="VAA8558-21-185"/> been busily engaged
              with a contested case during this session, meeting often in the morning at 9 o'clock,
              sitting part of the time during the sessions of the Senate, and sometimes at night
              till midnight, and it is not through with that contest yet. The session is now well
              near spent and it can not make the investigation talked of. A number of its members
              are lawyers engaged in active practice, who, when the session closes, will have to
              return to their homes. It is apparent the motion to reconsider should prevail. If the
              Senate sees fit to commit the investigation proposed to some other Committee, which
              shall sit during vacation, that is another question. This may be a proper subject for
              investigation, but to say in the broad language if the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke]
              that you must not make any charge against a man that you don't want the Senate to
              investigate, is going too far. The Senate ought to refer this matter to some special
              Committee with power to sit during vacation.</p>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGASS regarded this as a question outside the duties of representatives of
              the people. Every day and hour consumed in such an investigation is so much taken from
              the people of the State. No further attention should be paid to these memorials from
              either side. Even were an investigation to go on during vacation it would stop where
              it began, and that would be the end of it. Who would a Committee sitting in vacation
              report to? and after the report was made what action could the Senate take on it?
              There are other tribunals where such questions should be settled. They should not come
              before the Legislature over which it has no jurisdiction.</p>

            <p> Mr. YANCEY: It is apparent that when the memorial of Mr. Winterbotham was submitted
              to this body by his attorney in the contest it was to show the people that he was
              defrauded out of an election to Congress, and for the purpose of prejudicing the
              people against the Republican party; and it was to throw a damper on and injure the
              business of two great manufacturing interests in South Bend. These parties engaged in
              business there have been of more benefit to the people of Indiana than all the
              Democratic party of this State, or Nation, for that matter. [Laughter, and cries of
              "Hear, hear."]</p>

            <p> Mr. McCULLOUGH (interrupting): Does not the Senator mean that they have been of more
              benefit to the Republican party than all the Democrats in the State?</p>

            <p> Mr. YANCEY (resuming): NO sir. I mean to say that the Studebaker Wagon Works and the
              Oliver Chilled Plow Works have employed thousands and thousands of men to work for
              them, and the remuneration for the work has gone to the support of their families.
              Simply because the Democratic party could not control these men like slaves, and
              Winterbotham was not elected to Congress, they come howling into the Senate of Indiana
              like cowards as they are. If Winterbotham and his crew could have led their men to
              vote as they wanted there would have been no memorial sent here. ["Hear! Hear!"] For
              Democratic Senators to say the Senate has no jurisdiction over this case shows a small
              amount of consistency to say the least. These men of South Bend have been slaudered
              beyond questioned. They have laid their case before the Senate of Indiana, and in all
              candor and justice the Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName> ought
              to summon his Committee to meet him at South Bend and there investigate this matter
              like honest men, and the people of Indiana will not rest easy until this stain is
              removed from the character of these men.</p>

            <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS called attention to the history of this case in the Senate. The
              memorial signed by Mr. Winterbotham asked that a law be passed [reaching to the very
              question raised in that paper], to prevent the voting of employes by such
              manufacturing establishments. Following that came charges from Senators of crime in
              violation of the election laws in that part of the State. Following that came a
              memorial presented by the Senator from St. Joseph [Mr. Campbell]-when a bill was
              introduced on that subject. Now, to claim that this is not a proper subject for
              investigation is not consistent. This is a proper subject of investigation and has in
              view but one object, and that is to furnish data on which to pass a law reaching the
              very crime of which these manufacturers are accused. If it is for this purpose, then
              the proposition of the Senator from Jackson [Mr. Brown] that this matter shall be
              investigated in vacation, has no meaning, and is made simply for the purpose of
              meeting an objection, and an ambush behind which to hide their retreat from this
              investigation.</p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM: This is a charge made against two fo the most honorable manufacturing
              companies in the State by politicians as a stab at their business. This gentleman [Mr.
              Winterbotham] seeing he had not been elected, abandons a contest for a seat in
              Congress, then comes to the Senate, and not being content with striking at these
              loboring men, he must at the same time stab and inflict a wound on one of his own
              party, which was an insult to this Senate, and now he asks to be relieved from the
              responsibility. He went into the public prints with one of the most infamous charges
              against a member of his own party, and now he is tired of investigation.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN (interrupting): The Senator is mistaken. Mr. Winterbotham is exceedingly
              anxious that this investigation shall be conducted.</p>

            <p> Mr. GRAHAM: Mr. Winterbotham was at the foundation of this matter originally. He
              came in here with his memorial and followed it up with an attack, scandalous and
              unwarrantable, upon the Senator from Laporte [Mr. Hutchinson] in the public prints,
              and that Senator got to be an elephant on his hands. It had its foundation first in
              political purposes-in advancing his own business of employing Prison labor in
              opposition to these manufacturers who employ free labor. The reflection is upon these
              gentlemen and their business. As this has served Mr. Winterbotham's purpose he now is
              content, because he knows, and so does every man in this State know, that an
              investigation of these manufacturing companies will result in a complete vindication
              of these gentlemen.</p>

            <head rend="center">JURY TRIALS.</head>

            <p>Mr. Adam's bill [H. R. 74] to amend Section 409 of the civil procedure act, approved
              April 7, 1881, [provides for the trial of all civil causes involving issues of fact by
              Jury, unless the parties waive their rights] being read the third time-</p>

            <p>Mr. FRAZER stated that the proposition of this bill is to go back to the Jury system
              again, and he hoped the bill would not pass the House.</p>

            <p> Mr. SHIVELY desired that the bill would not pass the House. It requires all causes
              to be tried by Jury. He considered many cases too intricate in their nature for a Jury
              to hear and render an intelligent decision. Their decision is simply guess work. </p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH'S observation had been that Jurors were not allowed to note down evidence
              while in the Jury box. This is a privilege that the Judge can take ad vantage of and
              thereby reader a better decision than if placed under the same restrictions. On issues
              of fact, especially those involving intricate inquiries as to accounts, could not well
              be tried by a Jury, for the Juryman could not carry in his mind a long array of
              figures, being debarred from taking any notes to assist his memory. He thought this
              bill simply placed twelve men in a trammeled position. He was not in favor of the
              passage of the bill.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, thought the bill was of in the interest of economy. It would
              require at least one-third more time for the trial of cause in the Circuit Court of
              this State. In the interest of economy this bill should not pass. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN: When the bill was first Introduced was opposed to it, but after hearing
              the discussion in the House, and after close inspection of the bill, he favored its
              passage. He could not comprehend why Juries should not try questions of fact. In
              answer to the argument that injury sometimes results from trial by Jury, he said that
              in his long experience at the bar, he found that the benefit resulting from Jury
              trials very much overbalanced the injury. It is not supposed that every man who sits
              upon a Jury has a classical education. But he had always I found that the men who come
              from their farms to sit in the Jury box have as much good common sense as persons who
              are educated in Colleges. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY thought that in a great many cases the Jury could not arrive at the facts
              near enough to render a decision that would not immediately be set aside by the
              courts. He favored leaving the law as it now is. </p>

            <p>Mr. GORDON made an ineffectual motion to lay the bill on the table until a full
              House.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, said that while he had confidence in the good sense of Juries,
              he was nevertheless satisfied that under the limitations imposed upon Juries they
              could not try certain chancery cases. He then spoke of the expense and delay growing
              out of the trial of such cases by Juries, of the appeals to higher Courts and
              reversals and consequent delay. He called attention to the practice in other States in
              the Union as in harmony with the existing statute, that the federal Courts, and the
              Courts of the Nations most celebrated for their jurisprudence, recognized the wisdom
              of trying such cases by the Court. Nonresident creditors will avoid the State Courts
              if this law is repealed and seek relief in the Federal Courts wherever such Courts
              have jurisdiction. The inconvenience of this is well known to defendants at a distance
              from Courts. Bear in mind too that judgments in the Federal Courts are liens on lands
              of the defendants throughout the District, and the consequent inconvenience. It is the
              opinion of the most eminent jurists that the Judge only should try a certain class of
              chancery cases. This is approved and attested by the experience of civilized Spates. </p>

            <p> Mr. GORDON, when the question was up before, favored the bill, but since that time
              he had made some little inquiry, and was informed that there probably had been more
              appeals occasioned by this section than any other section of the Civil Code. He
              undertook to say that after a Judge had given instructions to the Jury that the Jury
              is just as apt to come to a correct decision as the Court itself. He was of the
              opinion that the bill should pass.</p>

            <p> Mr. ADAMS stated the objections to this bill simmer down to about one
              proposition-that of trials of cases involving accounts by Jury. He desired to ask if
              this one single objection alone should overbalance all the argument in favor of trial
              by Jury. In answer to the argument that a Jury is not competent to try a case
              involving accounts, he stated that he could take a Jury of Morgan County men, present
              the case to the Jury, and after the Judge had given his instructions that Jury could
              render as fair a decision as any Court in the world. Every member of his County bar
              desired the bill to&gt; <pb n="188" xml:id="VAA8558-21-187"/> pass. He wanted some man
              to tell him why it required more time to try a case before ft Jury than before ft
              Court. In answer to those gentlemen who claimed such to be the fact. He would say that
              they must have pettifogging lawyers in their Court. We do not have this class of
              lawyers down our way. He did not believe that if the bill passed it would make an
              increase of half a dozen cases in the Federal Courts. Wherever a question of fact is
              to be considered the nest way in the world to consider that fact is in the hearts of
              honest Jurors, This bill ought to pass; it is better for the lawyers, it is better for
              the farmers, and it is better for everybody. There were many real estate and mortgage
              transactions that ought to be tried by Juries. The bill passed the House by yeas, 52;
              nays, 22. </p>

            <head rend="center"> ELECTION PRECINCTS.</head>

            <p> Mr. Heffren's bill [H. R. 79] to amend Sections 8 and 9 of an act concerning
              elections proposing to increase the number of votes in election Precincts from 350 to
              500;] was read the third time. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, stated that the one thing he thought he knew about election
              matters was this that the less frequently the law was changed the better for all
              persons concerned. He thought the laws were changed so frequently that if we were to
              hold strictly to the letter of the law no elections would be legal. He thought that
              the Precincts should be small. It caused too great a delay of the election returns
              where the Precincts are large. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, opposed the passage of the bill, contending that the act of
              the last Legislature regulating election districts was working satisfactorily, and
              that to make the change proposed by this would be to practically disfranchise many
              workingmen, who could not vote until the last hour of the polling. He moved that the
              bill be recommitted with instructions to the <orgName>Committee on County and Township
                Business</orgName>. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT thought the motion to recommit should not prevail, and that the bill
              itself should be voted down. He thought the people of the State were satisfied with
              the present law. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY hoped the motion to recommit would prevail. It would simply place the bill
              back where it could be considered again by the Committee. </p>

            <p>Mr. GORDON was of the opinion that our present election law is good enough as it is.
              The bill would not be in the interest of economy. He hoped that the motion to recommit
              would not prevail and that the bill would not pass. </p>

            <p>Mr. STEWART opposed the motion to recommit. We have only had one election uno er the
              present law. The people have just learned where their Precincts are. He was of the
              opinion that the Precincts should not be channel every time the Legislature met. He
              considered the difference in the expense between having two Election Boards and having
              one to be very little. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELY was in favor of recommitting the bill. It had been a source of great
              inconvenience to the people of his County. He considered a Precinct of 350 voters too
              small in the rural districts. He thought 500 votes s to the Precinct was not too
              large. </p>

            <p>The motion to recommit was rejected.</p>

            <p>The bill was also rejected by yeas, 21; nays, 48. </p>

          <p> The Lieutenant Governor took the chair and commanded attention, while prayer ^was
            offered by Rev. R. S. Black.</p>

          <p>On motion by Mr. VOYLES the reading of the journal of Saturday's proceedings was
            dispensed with. </p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR stated the question to be on the motion to reconsider the Tote
            of the Senate empowering the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName> to send for
            persons and papers necessary to a full investigation of the charges of interfering with
            the free exercise of the elective franchise by the Studebaker and the Oliver
            Manufacturing Companies, of South Bend. in the Thirteenth Congressional election, by
            requiring their employes to vote such tickets as were placed in their hands by their
            bosses. </p>

          <p>Pending at the last adjournment. </p>

          <p>Mr. Voyles hoped the motion would not prevail Mr. Yancey opposed the motion, and
            favored an investigation of the charges by the Senate <orgName>Committee on
              Elections</orgName>.</p>

          <p>Mr. BELL said every presumption was in favor of the truth of these charges. There is no
            reason- able or moral doubt but that they are true. He wanted those things inquired into
            and if it discloses this sort of interference with the elective franchise he hoped no
            Democrat between the shores of the Atlantic and Pacific will purchase one single article
            from persons who resort to such practices. He hoped the Senate would take it out of the
            power of these men to drive their employes like dumb cattle to vote the Republican
            ticket. He hoped this matter would be probed to the bottom, and that such legislation
            would be had that no man will dare resort to such practices hereafter. As it is patent
            the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName> will not have time to properly investigate
            the matter, he hoped a Committee that can and will do so will be organized and examine
            thoroughly into this matter. </p>

          <p>Mr. SPANN contended that there is no power In this body to continue any Committee to
            investigate these charges after this General Assembly shall have adjourned, unless it
            reached to the qualifications of a member to a seat in this body. Because the
            Studebakers and the Olivers have been charged with a crime and have come into the Senate
            to refute the charge made by old man Winterbotham, who is in his dotage, the blue-
            blooded aristocrat "from Allen and Whitley [Mr. Bell] wants to boycotte such men.
            Senators upon the other side voted for this investigation, and now when they found the
            charges made by Winterbotham are untrue-false in foundation, false in fact, and based on
            a tissue of lies-they come in cringing like cowards, and ask to be relieved from
            investigation. He denounced it as an absolute political lie made out of whole cloth, for
            the purpose of damaging men in the District in which Mr. Winterbotham lives and to
            damage the present Senator from Laporte [Mr. Hutchinson.] The Senate has power to
            investigate only while the Senate is alive; after the Senate is dead it has no such
            power. The proposition to investigate these charges during vacation is t imply a trick
            and a subterfuge to get rid of the whole question, and to ask for something the Senate
            has not the power to grant. There ii nothing personal about this matter, but no man
            should charge the Republican party with dishonesty and fraud unless he meets from this
            side something that shall respond to it. There are four Democrats and three Republicans
            on the <orgName>Election Committee</orgName>, and the resolution is to investigate the
            Studebakers and Olivers, who are charged with criminally using their employes in favor
            of the Republican party. Now we say take the strong arm of the State of Indiana and
            with, the authority of the Senate probe this matter to the bottom. We throw down the
            gauntlet and make the challenge. With your majority in the Committee we are ready to
            make the issue and go into the fullest and fairest investigation. </p>

          <p>Mr BROWN had personally but the kindest feeling for these gentlemen in South Bend, bi.t
            was lead to believe from facts made to appear and which will be laid before any
            Committee which makes this investigation, that they, blinded perhaps by party zeal, or
            too much of a desire to agrandize wealth in their own hands, did, at the time stated and
            in the manner staler perpetrate one of the grossest outrages that could be practiced
            upon the American franchise. He had repeatedly asked the Senator from St. Joseph [Mr.
            Campbell] if the fact is not that agents of those manufacturers did not take their
              labor<pb n="191" xml:id="VAA8558-21-190"/>ing and workingmen from these institutions
            in squads and in the private conveyances of those establishments to and from the polls.
            If that be true, no matter from what motive, it is an improper interference with the
            free exercise of the right which every man is supposed guaranteed him by the
            Constitution-the right, untrammelled by any influence except by his own freedom of
            opinion, to vote as he pleased. He opposed the discharge of the <orgName>Committee on
              Elections</orgName> from the investigation of this matter and should oppose it until
            the Senate has made ample, full and complete provision for the discharge of this duty by
            some other Committee. He had seen nothing, heard nothing and knew nothing to cause a
            change of his opinion, and desired that this investigation should not falter, and if it
            is thought the <orgName>Elections Committee</orgName> can not make the investigation he
            stood ready to help form a Committee that can make the investigation and report thereof
            to the people of Indiana. </p>

          <p> Mr. FOULKE read the present law touching undue influence of employers over employes in
            exercising the right of the elective franchise, and remarked that if the Studebakers
            have by threat or intimidation, or the refusal of time for their employes to vote-even
            that-there is already a law in Indiana which provides that they shall be imprisoned for
            a term of not less than one year. Where is the tribunal for the examination of that
            fact? The Grand Jury of the County in which the crime occurred. If these charges are
            true why is Mr. Winterbotham here where nothing can be done for his relief? Why is he
            away from the Congress of the United States? Why is he absent from the sittings of the
            Grand Jury in St. Joseph County? It is because the charges have no existence in fact.
            The United States Grand Jury has the right to investigate also. Why is he not there? Why
            does he not go to some Tribunal that has jurisdiction? This comes before us bearing upon
            its face evidence of fraud. We have the right to presume that each and every charge is
            false. These are charges made by a Democrat to make Democratic capital out of it. This
            Democratic petition has gone out for wool and comes in shorn. </p>

          <p> Mr. BUNDY was satisfied that Mr. Winterbotham saw his case was gone-he had no hope of
            succeeding in a contest for a seat in Congress, and put this memorial in the Indiana
            Senate simply for the purpose of getting revenge out of these men in the city of South
            Bend, who opposed his election. And when these men, against whom these charges are made,
            presented a petition asking for an investigation of the truth of these charges, what did
            you do? You referred them to the <orgName>Election Committee</orgName>. Why didn't the
            Chairman of that Committee say that it had so much before it that it could not make the
            investigation. Then we could have referred to a Committee that could have attended to
            it. But you let it remain until the close of the session, and I charge it upon you that
            it was done purposely. The Committee comes in now and says: "We have not time." It is
            too late finding that out. He opposed the motion to reconsider. If the <orgName>Election
              Committee</orgName> can't attend to it let it return the matter to the Senate. </p>

          <p> Mr. CAMPBELL-The memorial from these manufacturers asking an investigation of the
            influences brought to control the election in South Bend is no intrusion. It only came
            after the Winterbotham memorial of grave charges against them had been entertained and a
            bill drafted and placed upon the calender of this Senate, based upon the assumption that
            the charges of the first memorial are true; and more than that, a challenge for an
            investigation. Then they asked, and I still demand for them, that an investigation may
            be had, to see what legislation is needed, and who needs protection and from what, but
            as it seems now that this is to be denied, I want to say that, coming myself from the
            city of South Bend, with a full and complete personal knowledge of the facts as it is
            possible for a man to have. I know that the charge that these manufacturers discharged
            or threatened to discharge, coerced, intimidated or in any way improperly influenced the
            votes of their employes is not true. It is a malignam falsehood, concocted and
            promulgated for political capital, and now it is returning like the boomerang which a
            falsehood always proves to be. It is now claimed as a pretext for withdrawing from this
            investigation that the Senate has no jurisdiction. I grant that we are not a Court to
            decide upon criminal actions or to punish, or to release from punishment any man or men.
            I understand full well that we are not here to decide or even to listen to or consider
            in any manner whatever personal or political grounds or abuses, but the objects of the
            investigation is not to decide upon the merits of any personal or political quarrel, but
            to determine fairly and intelligently if there be any call for legislation for this
            purpose, neither can any one deny the detestable force that would be enacted were
            legislation had, or even contemplated upon so important a matter, without the most
            careful investigation on both sides of the question, and this is one of my great reasons
            for inviting and still challenging an investigation, because I know that when had with a
            view to determining legislation it must be had fully upon both sides. I am prompted, not
            so much by a desire to have the Studebaker Wagon Works and the Oliver Chilled Plow Works
            exonerated, for I question if there be ten men in the State of Indiana who believe them
            to be guilty of any offense against the elective franchise, but I want this
            investigation to show, as it would, the depth of infamy to which the Democratic party
            sank itself in conducting the campaign of the Thirteenth District. I want a report made
            of the measured quantities of whisky, the unlimited supply of money the coercion, and
            intricue so damnable that I would blush to stand here and enumerate them, and then I
            wanted to see if, when this report was made, this Assembly would have the patriotism to
            enact laws for the punishment of these crimes which if unrebuked and oft-repeated must
            crush to powder the very rock of our national salvation-the ballot-box. And, sir, I
            demand, sir, that the investigation shall be made. In answer to the oft repeated
            statement that affidavits may be had, and are now in Mr. Winterbotham's hands, against
            these manufacturers, I have only to say I think, or possibly I have the written
            statement of a man who says that he was offered $250, which is half of $500, offered to
            another party to get six affidavits. When affidavits are wanted so badly I suppose that
            they can be gotten or made to order. </p>

          <p> Mr. McCULLOUGH said that a more respected memoriral than Mr. Winterbotham's was never
            presented to any Legislative body. It does not mention names, and the purpose is that
            the Legislature may pass such a law as will protect the elective franchise and prevent
            the sort of practice complained of. The only question the Senate can have to do with is
            the question whether there shall be legislation on that subject and whether such
            practices have been committed heretofore has nothing to do with it. The investigation by
            the Committee into the laws in existence and not to investigate people-wagon
            manufacturers or anything else. If the practices complained of have existed, all this
            Legislature can do is to pass laws to prevent it in the future. If the Studabakers have
            not been doing anything wrong, it will not hurt them. If they are opposed to that sort
            of legislation it will look like they didn't want it. Mr. Winterbotham is still asking
            us to go ahead with the investigation and opposed to my making this motion to
            reconsider. As a <pb n="192" xml:id="VAA8558-21-191"/> matter of fact these charges hare
            been made through the public prints for the past three or four months. The Courts have
            been open all that time, and why is it that these gentlemen have not taken this
            investigation to that tribunal? If their charge is untrue Mr. Winterbotham has thrown
            down the glove and said to these gentlemen: "Come into the Courts and make me pay for
            it." Instead of Mr. Winterbotham's being abused he ought to be honored for sending to
            the Senate that memorial, because it is not every man that has the nerve to do it. Some
            men are cowards when It comes to charging a man with crime, but Mr. Winterbotham is not
            a coward. These gentlemen can make him pay for it in the Courts of law. The Constitution
            opens for them a Tribunal where they can force an investigation if they want to
            investigate as bad as they pretend. Let them go to a tribunal whose judgment means
            something. It is a crime against the people of the State to take the people's money to
            pay for an investigation they are too cowardly to make for themselves. For very many
            reasons this investigation would necessarily be a farce, and all this talk about wanting
            to investigate is mere political claptrap that ought not to wave with any member. As
            this matter has consumed the time of the Senate long enough he moved the previous
            question.</p>

            <p> The following described bills were reported back from Committees with a
              recommendation that further action be indefinitely postponed:</p>

            <p>Mr. WILEY, from the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, reported back Mr.
              Frazer's bill [H. R. 336] to amend Section 863 of an act concerning proceedings in
              civil cases. The report was concurred in.</p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN, from the same Committee, reported back Mr. Shively's bill [H. R. 248] to
              amend section 1,637 of the Revised Statutes of 1881, concerning proceedings in
              criminal cases. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELY hoped that the report of the Committee would not be concurred in He had
              introduced the bill for the purpose of relieving the Courts. It provides that small
              misdemeanors, there the fine does not exceed $5, shall he tried before Justices, and
              that they shall have exclusive jurisdiction. It is merely to keep these trivial
              offenses out of our Courts. </p>

            <p>The report of the Committee was concurred in. </p>

            <head rend="center">ORAL ARGUMENT-SUPREME COURT.</head>

            <p> Mr. McMullen, from the same Committee, reported back Mr. Wiley's bill [H. R. 249] in
              relation to petition for rehearing in the Supreme Court.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILEY explained that he introduced the bill by request. </p>

            <p>The bill provides that the Supreme Court shall hear oral argument in cases, of
              appeals, and that the Judge rendering the original decision shall not be allowed to
              participate in the deliberations on such appeal. He has received a great many letters
              from lawyers who desired that the bill should become a law. It is a wholesome measure,
              and he felt that the bill should pass. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN was opposed to the bill on the ground that it would consume too much time
              for the Court to stop and hear oral argument. Each lawyer would consume something near
              a week in his argument for appeal.</p>

            <p>Mr. McMULLEN felt that the question of time should not be considdred where justice
              was at stake. He was opposed to allowing the Judge who had rendered the original
              decision to take part in the consideration of the appeals. He considered the spirit of
              the bill to be good, and favored recommitting the bill with the instruction that a
              docket fee or penalty be inserted in order to prevent annuals being taken in cases not
              having sufficient and reasonable grounds. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT favored oral argument before the Supreme Court. He did not accord any
              weight to the argument that it would consume the time of the Court. When per ons
              desire to come before the Supreme Court they should have that privilege. He moved that
              the bill be recommitted to the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName> with
              instructions that the bill be amended as suggested by Mr. McMullen and reported back
              favorably. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, was opposed to the bill. He thought the provision of the bill
              reflected on the Court.</p>

            <p>Mr. Jewett's motion to recommit was agreed to. </p>

              back Mr. Robinson's bill [H. R. 314] concerning attorneys employed by County
              Commissioners. </p>

            <p>Mr. ROBINSON hoped that the report of the Committee would not be concurred in. He
              believed that it was right that these attorneys should not be allowed to appear before
              the County Commissioners.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, explained that the attorneys could not now, according to the
              decision of the Supreme Court, appear before the Commissioners by whom they are
              employed. He favored recommitting the bill, and moved that it be recommitted with
              instructions.</p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>Mr. RAHM, from the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName> returned the general
              appropriation bill [H. R. 302] with some sixteen amendments proposed by that
              Committee.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. BELL the Senate resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName> [Mr. Bell in the Chair] for the consideration of special order,
              being the general appropriation bill [H. R. 302] making appropriations for the State
              Government and its Institutions.</p>

            <p>The bill having been read through-</p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM move d that the Committee recommend the bill be printed with the
              amendments proposed by the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>. He urged great
              care in this the most important bill that will come before this body. The whole matter
              should be before the Committee in printed form.</p>

            <p>Mr. RAHM explained the Committee amendments were mainly in the amounts-changed either
              to reduce or increase the sums.</p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN supported the motion to print, not for the purpose of delay, but for
              careful and intelligent consideration, as ought to be done. </p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE considered the printing unnecessary, proposing to proceed with the
              consideration of the bill, at least till the Committee shall differ with the bill as
              transmitted here from the House. There are but few changes proposed by the bill, a
              difference of probably not to exceed $14,000. He was inclined to think this was a move
              to put off the bill from day to day till a later time in the session, when want of
              time may be plead. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES thought there was no need of delay for the printing of the Committee
              amendments and counseled immediate action. </p>

            <p>The motion was rejected.</p>

            <p>The Committee then proceeded to consider the bill by clauses. </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY moved to make the salary of the Governor's Messenger $720 Instead of
              $700-the same that person was allowed for the part two years. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD said $700 was the largest amount till 1881; previous to that time $600
              was the sum. </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY understood the Messenger did more work than the Governor's Private
              Secretary.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE noticed the first appropriation for this Messenger was in 1877. In two
              years since that time there was no appropriation; $700 was enough for this Messenger. </p>

            <p>Mr. FAULKNER moved to amend the amendment by inserting $600. That was sufficient. He
              could furnish any number from his County for that money. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN did not think there was another person connected with the Governor's office
              who did so much labor.</p>

            <p>The amendment to the amendment was rejected affirmative. 21; negative, 24. </p>

            <p>The amendment for $720 was also rejected by the casting vote of the Chairman. </p>

            <p>Mr. FAULKNER made an ineffectual motion to strike out the appropriation for the
              Governor's Clerk. The Committee's amendment, reducing the salary of the Adjutant
              General from $1,400 to $1,200, to comply with the statute fixing the salary at the
              latter sum being read- </p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY staged that if the salary is not raised by a bill for that purpose the
              amendment should be adopted; but believing that the bill fixing the salary at $1,400
              should be passed, he apposed the amendment. </p>

            <p>Mr. McINTOSH did not think the bill referred to would be passed. </p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS thought if there be any correspondence between what work is done and
              the pay, and any one acquainted with the work of that office well knows the work can
              not be done by a competent officer for $l,200. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES favored the Committee amendment.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE said the Committee had put down the salary of the Assistant Attorney
              General, and he did not think this was a very essential office, and $l,000 was the sum
              fixed in 1879 and was sufficient. </p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS: Under the charge of this office are papers of immense importance to
              the soldiers of the State, and it was a very essential office. </p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM praised the work done by the present incumbent, and insisted encouragement
              should be extended in that direction. He hoped the $1,400 would be retained. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN: Out of the growing importance of this office the $1,400 should be left as
              in the bill. </p>

              <p>The Doorkeeper announced a message from the House of Representatives. </p>

              <p>On motion of Mr. BROWN the Committee rose to allow the Senate to convene in order
                to receive the message from the House, which announced the passage by that body of

                required by the rules. </p>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the motion lost. </p>

              <head rend="center">THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>

              <p> On motion of Mr. BELL the Senate resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of the
                  Whole</orgName> for the further consideration of the general appropriation bill,
                the question being on the <orgName>Finance Committee </orgName>'s amendment striking
                out $1,400 and writing in lieu $1,200 for the salary of the Adjutant General. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD defied gentlemen to point in this bill to a single dollar increase in
                any Democratic official; but on the contrary there is a decrease. </p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN knew no change in affairs that 'would'allow a man to maintain a family
                for less now than two years ago, consequently he favored 'the $1.400 sum as in the
                bill. </p>

              <p>The Committee amendment was reported.</p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE moved to reduce the Governor's civil contingent fund from $2,000 to
                $1,000 in accordance with the recommendation of the late State Auditor in his report
                to this General Assembly. The attention of the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>
                was not called to this matter.</p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY was informed this appropriation has never been less than $2,000, and as a
                matter of course, all the money not used will go back into the Treasury.</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN believed the Governor to be an honest, careful, conscientious public
                servant. The appropriation does not require the Governor to use all the money. He
                did not always judge the future by the past. This appropriation is made to aid in
                enforcing the laws of the Senate. He was willing to trust this money in his hands,
                and should support the $2,000 appropriation. </p>

              <p>The Committee amendment reducing the appropriation to $1,200 was
                rejected-affirmative, 16; negative, 22.</p>

              <p>The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>'s recommendation that $2,500 be inserted
                instead of $3 000, for the Governor's military contingent fund, was agreed to upon a
                division-affirmative, 24; negative. 19.</p>

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM moved to increase the salary of the Secretary of State from $2,000 to
                $2,500.</p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES insisted an appropriation bill is not the place to fix salaries.</p>

              <p>The motion was rejected.</p>

              <p>The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>'s recommendation of an increase of the
                appropriation for the distribution of public documents from $300 to $800 was agreed
                to. </p>

              <p>Mr. SAYRE moved to strike out the appropriation for a Deputy Auditor of State, for
                the reason that the office yields the Auditor of State, as he understands. $L,000 a
                month.</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN, while in favor of a just compensation, did not believe the Auditor
                receives any too much compensation, and would favor an increase rather than a
                decrease.</p>

              <p>The motion was rejected.</p>

              <p>Mr. SAYRE moved to strike out the salary provided for a clerk of the Auditor of
                State, for the reasons stated.</p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS: If the statement that the office is worth $1,000 a month is true,
                this motion should prevail, as should the preceding motion.</p>

              <p>Mr. YANCEY opposed the motion.</p>

              <p> It was rejected.</p>

              <p>Mr. SAYRE moved ineffectually to strike out the salary for the law department
                clerk; and also to strike out the salary for the insurance department clerk of the
                Auditor's office. The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>'s recommendation to
                increase the office expense appropriation of the Auditor's office from $750 to
                $1,000, being stated-</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD explained, for the past few years when the enumeration is made to fix
                the apportionment of the General Assembly, this appropriation is increased.</p>

              <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>

              <p> Mr. GRAHAM moved that the Committee rise, report progress and ask leave to sit
                again on Mr. WILLARD'S suggestion, at 2 o'clock Thursday afternoon. </p>

              <p>The motion was agreed to. Accordingly the Committee rose, and through its Chairman
                reported as instructed.</p>

              <p>The report was concurred in by the Senate.</p>

              <p>Mr. HILLIGASS introduced a bill [S. 279] for relief of Weems Heagy, former
                Treasurer of Madison County, and his securities, which was read the first time and
                referred to the appropriate Committee. </p>

              <head rend="center">BUREAU OF STATISTICS.</head>

              <p> On motion by Mr. MAGEE the bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_078">S. 78</ref>] to
                amend Section 2 of the act to establish a State Bureau of Statistics [the Chief to
                be selected by the General Assembly] was read the second time, with a Committee
                amendment providing that the first election shall take place oh the taking effect of
                this act, which was concurred in. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN moved to amend by striking out all after the enacting clause, and
                denounced this as one of those infamous political bills to legislate out a man
                appointed by the Governor. This ought not to be done unless there can be some good
                reason given why it should lie done. He called upon the author of the bill to give a
                reason. </p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE said, acting upon the advice of the Senator from Rush [Mr. Spann], who
                said in the beginning of the session, "You, gentlemen, are entitled to the offices
                and you should have them," he had introduced this bill. There is an office created
                by that bill we want for the benefit of the people and we don't want it continued in
                the interest of a political party. We want a Democrat in that office, because all
                things being equal he is the best man. We don't want that office run in the interest
                of the Republican State Central Committee. We want that office run for the purpose
                named in the law creating it to furnish vital statistics. We don't want it to
                furnish statistics for either the Republican or the Democratic party. We don't wan't
                a man to discharge the duties of that office and at the same time dis- charge the
                duties of Assistant Secretary to the Central Committee of a political party. Without
                having any specific information, he said the charge comes from political and
                personal friends. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN now supposed we had gotten to the bottom of this move. The Senator
                confesses there is nothing in this bill at all but the fact that the hungry
                Democrats want this one little office. Not being satisfied with taking the
                benevolent Institutions and Reformatory Institutions, and taking the State Prisons,
                and taking everything in sight, it is left for the Senator from Cass [Mr. Magee] to
                come in and claim the whole earth. [Laughter.] There is nothing in the bill but that
                it turns out of office a competent man He denied the charge that the head of this
                Bureau has run it in the interest of the Republican party. The gentlemen at the head
                of this Department would not allow that thing to be done if they knew it. If it has
                been done it was without their knowledge or authority. This bill is one of
                considerable importance, and for the purpose of having it fully and fairly
                discussed-it being now late in the afternoon-he moved that the Senate adjourn. </p>

              <p>The motion was rejected. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD demanded the previous question. </p>

              <p>The demand was seconded by the Senate by yeas, 25; nays, 19. The main question was
                ordered by yeas, 25; nays, 21, and the motion to strike out all after enacting

              considered as engrossed and put upon its passage, and on that motion he demanded the
              previous question. </p>

            <p>This demand was seconded by yeas, 56; nays, 41, and under the operations thereof the

            <p>The Speaker announced that the question before the House was the motion by Mr.

              pending when the House took the noon recess. </p>

            <p>The yeas and nays having been demanded the vote resulted yeas, 40; nays, 48. </p>

              <p>The special order for the House being the bill [S. 1] to provide for the better
                government and management of the State Benevolent Institutions, Mr. Jewett demanded
                that the special order be taken up, which was agreed to by the House.</p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT stated that this was a very wise measure and had been thoroughly
                discussed, and as he thought no one would be enlightened by a further discussion of
                the bill he moved the previous question, which was seconded by yeas 53; nays. 39. </p>

              <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 55; nays. 38. </p>

              <p>The SPEAKER decided the special order to be Mr. Jewett's bill [H. R. 26] to amend
                Section 6 of an act concerning promissory notes, bills of exchange, etc. </p>

              <p>The bill was read and by yeas, 41; nays, 52, the further consideration was passed
                over at present.</p>

              <p>The Speaker decided that the special order before the House was the motion by Mr.
                Shaw to reconsider the vote by which Mr. Shively's bill [H. R. 248] to amend Section
                64 of an act concerning proceedings in criminal cases was indefinitely
                postponed.</p>

              <p>Mr. SHAW thought it was a bill of some importance, and spoke in favor of his
                motion. </p>

              <p>Mr. McMULLEN stated that the House had spent some time in the consideration of the
                question of tile jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace, and he thought it was not
                worth while to occupy more time, and he therefore moved to lay the motion on the

              <p>The motion to lay on the table was rejected by yeas, 29; nays, 51. </p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. HEFFREN the report of the Committee was laid on the table, and on

              <head rend="center">THE LATE HENRY C. MEREDITH.</head>

              <p> On demand by Mr. MERING the special order for the hour was called up, it being the
                resolution of respect concerning the death of ex-Representative Henry C. Meredith,
                of Wayne County. </p>

              <p>The resolution was read by order of the Speaker. </p>

              <p>Mr. MERING said: As the mover of the resolution it will be expected that I make
                some remarks, and I only wish I was more competent to outline the character of and
                portray the many good qualities of our deceased friend. But I am glad to know that I
                will be followed by those who knew him longer and more <pb n="198"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-21-197"/> intimately than I; and who will do full justice to one
                whose life was in every way a worthy example. My acquaintance with Henry C.
                Meredith, though running through a period of twelve years, was slight indeed. He
                lived in the west and I in the east of our County. I do not remember of ever having
                met him save in the city of Richmond, and then but for a few moments conversation.
                His extended hand and smiling countenance gave at once a passport to his friendship
                and confidence. I knew him in another way. It was through the popular estimate which
                the community in which a man lives places upon him and measures and gauges him
                accordingly. As a rule Its judgment is correct and just. Tried by this standard, he
                was the peer of any man as a dutiful son exemplary as the head of a family, and
                performing cheerfully all the duties of citizenship. Bearing the honored name of him
                who commanded the "Iron Brigade," the eyes of our people were constantly upon him,
                and it is not flattery to say that their just expectations were always realized. As
                President of our State Board of Agriculture he was prompt and efficient in the
                discharge of Its many duties. In his own County, as his father before him, he was at
                the head in the breeding and rearing of fine stock. Honored as he was by the
                confidence of his fellow-citizens, he held a seat in this body, and served in the
                Fifty second General Assembly of the State of Indiana. The summons of death came
                unexpectedly, but be died as he had lived, calmly and gently entering upon the
                unknown realities of another existence. He passed away in the prime of his manhood,
                when it seemed that a career of great usefulness was widening out before him. The
                last of his name, he sleeps by the monument which he erected to the memory of his
                loved father, having lived a life worthy of all emulation and bequeathing to us a
                record full of good deeds. </p>

              <p>Mr. BEESON said: I think that on an occasion like this it is fitting and proper
                that we should stop the wheels of legislation for a time that we pay a tribute of
                respect to one that so young in lire had obtained such as honorable position in the
                service of the state. Henry C. Meredith was born near Cambridge County, July 17,
                1843, and died, After a short illness, at his residence, near that place, July 5,
                1882 He was the last living representative of an old and honored family who had been
                identified with the history of Eastern Indiana for over fifty years, and was
                recognized as leaders in all measures for public improvement, education and good
                morals. Henry C. Meredith's wife was the daughter of Hon. O. B. Claypool, of
                Connersville, Ind. It was my fortune to have personal acquaintance with him for a
                number of years, and to those who knew him it is scarcely necessary to speak of his
                many noble qualities. He was beloved because he was frank, cordial and sincere, and
                looked with the eyes of charity upon the failings and mistakes of men. This death,
                how sudden! He was in the prime life. Many years of distinction and honor were
                apparently before him. His life in this world is ended, his mission accomplished,
                and he has gone to join the innumerable host in that undiscovered country, from
                which there is no return. Life is but a span. We determine upon our plans, we lay
                out our work, arrange the programme for a long term of years-and view it, panorama
                like; when suddenly, perhaps without warning, our lives are required of us, and the
                bright future fades into the dark mystery of death. Even now, "our hearts, like
                muffled drums, are beating funeral marches to the grave." I cordially second the
                adoption of the resolution.</p>

              <p>Mr. HUSTON said: I most heartily concur with the gentlemen from Wayne [Mr Mering
                and Mr. Beeson] in all that they have said in regard to Henry C. Meredith. I knew
                him as a citizen, I knew him in society, and I served with him in the last General
                Assembly. I can say this of him: That Henry C. Meredith was an honest man. He was
                honest to himself,he was honest to his family, and he was honest to his country. He
                was a man of strong conviction. He was a man who was actuated by what he considered
                to be for the best interest of the people. He was not actuated by any selfish
                motive. Henry C. Meredith lived in the County adjoining the one in which I live, and
                consequently I knew much of him and the estimation in which he was held by his own
                people. He was a man of large public spirit; a man who evinced great interest in the
                affairs of the County and State, He was a graduate of Bloomington University. After
                his graduation he conducted a paper at Cambridge City. It was a newspaper of the
                people and for the people. I attended the funeral of Mr. Meredith, and I do not
                remember of having ever attended a funeral where the people, without regard to party
                distinction, evinced to much sympathy for a bereaved family as was felt and shown
                for the family of Henry C. Meredith. His wife is a most estimable woman, a lady whom
                I have known all my life. I most cordially second the adoption of the resolution. </p>

              <p>Mr. FRAZEE stated that it was in the capacity of a breeder of thoroughbred Short
                Horn cattle that he was most intimately associated with Henry C. Meredith, and that
                it afforded him pleasure to bear testimony to his strict integrity and high sense of
                right and wrong. He considered him a gentleman of refinement and culture. In his
                associations with him he had not heard him utter a word that might not with
                propriety be uttered in the presence of ladies. Mr. Meredith was fortunate in bis
                marriage to Virginia Claypool, of Fayette County, a young lady upon whom nature had
                been lavish of her gifts and i charms She was educated at Glendale College, where
                she carried off the first honors of her class. By an inscrutable Providence Henry C.
                Meredith has been called home, ere his sun was in its zenith, in the prime and vigor
                of his manhood, while his step was yet elastic, and with no gray hairs upon his
                brow. The last representative of a noble family, his two older brothers, the Major
                and Captain, had offered up their lives upon their country's altar.</p>

              <p>Mr. Deem paid a tribute of respect to the deceased. </p>

              <p>Mr. MELLETT was not personally acquainted with Mr. Meredith in his lifetime, but he
                knew him as an honest, valued citizen-a man whose usefulness in society was
                acknowledged. He cordially concurred in all that had been said.</p>

              <p> Mr. Campbell and Mr. Smith, of Tippecanoe, heartily seconded the resolution.</p>

              <p> Mr. Shockney also submitted a few remarks.</p>

              <p> Mr. Sutten, as a further mark of respect, moved that the House adjourn.</p>

              <p> The motion was agreed to. </p>

            <head rend="center">TEACHER'S LICENSE.</head>

            <p>On motion by Mr. WHITE his graded teacher's license bill [<ref
                target="#SB_1883_01_04_145">S. 145</ref>-see page 72, and 182, of the Brevier
              Reports] was taken up, it having failed to pass last Saturday.</p>

            <p> Mr. YANCEY said this bill ought not to pass. If a trial license is required the bill
              is unfair, because it prohibits the granting of six months' license the second time.
              Again, a young man or young woman not able to obtain a longer license should be
              granted a six months' license as often as applied for, if they can pass the
              examination therefor, otherwise an aristocracy in this line may spring up. In justice
              to those aspiring to qualify themselves for teachers the bill should be rejected. </p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH, of Jay, opposed the bill. Some teachers holding a twenty-four months'
              license to-day do not teach as good a school as some holding a six months' license. He
              condemned the system, or the class of questions propounded to teachers on examination.
              This bill ought not to become a law. </p>

            <p>Mr. ADKISON was influenced the other day by the Senator from Hancock [Mr. Yancey] and
              the Senator from Jay [Mr. Smith] to oppose the bill. Having thoroughly examined the
              bill since he did not believe the bill subject to the objections urged by these
              Senators. It is as important to guard the community against incompetent school
              teachers as against incompetent doc- tors. The bill contains a stimulus for young
              people to prepare themselves for the discharge of their duties as teachers. </p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY also voted against the bill the other day, but should vote for it now. He
              looked upon this as an important matter-bearing upon the education of the people of
              the State, it is not simply for the purpose of furnishing occupation for persons, and
              if they can not more perfectly prepare themselves under a six months' license for'a
              twelve months' license they had better quit. </p>

            <p>The bill parsed the Senate by yeas, 33; nays, 12. </p>

            <head rend="center"> THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.</head>

            <p> On motion by Mr. SPANN the Senate returned to the consideration of his motion
              pending at the adjournment yesterday, to reject the House amendment to Mr. Brown's
              bill [S. 1] for the better management of the Benevolent Institutions-see pages 105,
              135 and 136 of the Brevier Reports. He said the judgment of the Senate was this
              amendment stricken out in the House should prevail, and he desired to know upon what
              ground objection is made to such a humane provision. He urged Senators to rise about
              the rut of political necessity in this humane feature. We are willing a Democratic
              woman should be put in the position and have charge of this unfortunate class of
              fellow-beings. If this section remains he would vote for the bill. He favored
              recognizing women of the State who have the ability.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN offered a substitute for the motion that the Senate concur in the House
              amdnemtn. The Senate can not dictate to the House what it ought to do, even to get the
              vote of the Senator from Rush. All this talk about a female physician has been made
              for the purpose of defeating the bill, because this matter is left to the decision of
              the Board of Trustees, who can make just such an appointment, as the Senator desires,
              if they feel so disposed. He demanded the previous question.</p>

            <p> The demand for the previous question was seconded by the Senate-yeas, 25; nays,
              20.</p>

            <p> Under its operations the substitute motion, that the Senate concur in the House
              amendment, was agreed to by yeas, 27; nays, 21.</p>

            <p>The motion as amended was agreed to by yeas, 27; nays, 21-and so the Senate concurred
              in the House amendment, striking out of the bill the section requiring the Female
              Department of the <pb n="200" xml:id="VAA8558-21-199"/> Insane Asylum to be placed in
              charge of a competent female physician. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to reconsider the vote concurring in the House amendment, and to lay
              the motion to reconsider on the table. </p>

            <p>The latter motion was agreed to by yeas, 28; nays, 20. </p>

            <p> Mr. CAMPBELL moved for a dispensation of the constitutional rule that his bill [S.
              247-described on page 167 of these reports] for the better advertisement of contracts
              labor, that it may be pressed &gt;to the final vote. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN opposed the motion. The bill is not in the proper shape. It is a covert
              attempt to strike down existing contracts for the purpose of annulling them. He asked
              if the author would object to an amendment exempting existing con tracts from the
              operations of the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL had no objection,not intending to interfere with existing contracts. </p>

            <p>The motion to suspend the rules was rejected yeas, 28; nays, two-thirds not voting in

            <head rend="center"> PURCHASE OF TOLL ROADS.</head>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGASS called up his bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_048">S. 48</ref>-see
              page 167 of the Brevier Reports] providing for the appraisement, purchase an'l
              convertment of toll roads into free roads, which failed to pass last Monday. He
              explained it provides for a majority petition by owners of land lying along the roads.
              The Committee can order an appraisement on the actual cost value and make assessment
              on lands benefited lying within one and one-half miles of the road. The provisions are
              the same as under the free gravel road law. It only encumbers the land owners along
              the line represented by a majority of petitions. The limit is ten years for the tax to
              be paid.</p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS feared it would permit the sale of some roads at eight or ten times
              actual value, and enable parties who have bought up stock at a nominal price to
              recover from parties along the line full value, and make them pay the second time for
              the same road. </p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS considered a sufficient answer to be this: that the question of
              purchase is left with a majority of land owners along the line. </p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM also feared the burden of paying for a road the second time by owners
              along the line of the road. The provisions of the bill will allow the taking away from
              owner thereof his stock in such roads without a fair compensation. That arbitrary
              right is not permitted by the Constitution. In his County there are a number of toll
              roads and the people want them continued. Our experience with free gravel roads has
              not been so satisfactory. The provisions of this bill would be liable to very great
              abuse-it will allow the appraisement of an old gravel road and compel its sale to the
              persons who built it. </p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS regarded this as a vicious bill. He suggested a difficulty where the
              road is mortgaged-it would not be bought.</p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGAS thought the illustration an extreme one-there are probably not, a half
              dozen in the State mortgaged-but there is a provision in the bill that will overcome
              the difficulty suggested.</p>

            <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH suggested a difficulty where owners of land along the line may be
              heavy stockholders.</p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS: The roads are not to be appraised beyond a fair cash value. There are
              provisions to protect every man who considers himself aggrieved. </p>

            <p>Mr. LOCKRIDGE saw in the bill no provision for appeal on one side-the rule ought to
              work both ways. He was not opposed to the general provisions of the bill but desired
              to see this objection remedied before voting for it. </p>

            <p>Mr. SAYRE also opposed the bill because the public interest is not sufficiently
              guarded. Money can be drawn for the purchase from the County Treasury without
              reference to the justice of the appraisement. While a taxpayer might enjoin, here are
              the mandatory provisions in the bill that its appraisement at a fair cash value shall
              be paid.</p>

            <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas, 30; nays, 16. </p>

              prohibiting certain animals running at large, which failed passing Saturday. He said
              it is a copy of the bill that came near passing two years ago.</p>

            <p>Mr. ADKISON opposed this bill because his constituency, without regard to age, sex,
              or previous condition of servitude, are opposed to it. There is an abundance of
              outside range for cattle and horses, and they desire to avail themselves of their

              <p> Mr. Benz's bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_006">S. 6</ref>] for the election and
                appointment of Supervisors of Highways [see pages 78, 97, 131, 169, 175 and 176 of
                the Brevier Reports] coming up in order, it was read the third time. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN and Mr. Voyles pointed out omissions in the bill of sections adopted by
                the Senate. </p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY moved to recommit the bill to a Committee of Three [Mr. Benz, Voyles and
                Henry] with instructions to strike out the emergency clause and insert Mr. Voyles'
                section.</p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY said the bill as it now stands is inconsistent.</p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES referred to three sections which were adopted by the Senate the other
                day and omitted from the engrossed bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD had no doubt the Senator from Washington [Mr. Voyles] thinks his
                sections were adopted, but the journal of the Senate shows they were not. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES The fact is all the same. No matter what the record is, the Brevier
                Reports show the sections were adopted as amended by a substitute offered by the
                Senator from Madison [Mr. Henry] to a clause in the third section as proposed by
                him.</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN read from the Brevier Report record to show the facts as stated by Mr.
                Voyles, the Senator from Washington.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD would consent to a recommittal if the bill be reported back at
                once.</p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY moved a substitute for the motion to recommit to a Committee of One [Mr.
                Benz] with instructions, so that upon the taking effect of the act Township Trustees
                shall appoint Supervisors, and striking out the postponement of the taking effect of
                the act until the first Monday of April, 1884, and the three Sections, 36, 37 and 38
                [Mr. Voyles'], as adopted the other day. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN would vote for the bill if the emergency clause be stricken out. </p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY insisted this General Assembly can determine a time when a law shall go
                into effect, but not sooner than the Constitution contemplates, except in cases of
                emergency, which is also provided for in the Constitution. The law now on the
                statute books is one of the best ever enacted, but there has been no opportunity to
                test its bad qualities because of a defect in furnishing the money for carrying out
                its provisions. </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY was not as well satisfied with this bill as be would like to, but it is a
                better one than the House bill, and if we are to have either he preferred this. It
                is for the interest of the roads of the State to have the bill take effect at
                once.</p>

              <pb n="201" xml:id="VAA8558-21-200"/>

              <p> Mr. VOYLES favored the motion to recommit. He desired to see the bill made
                consistent, and to see his amendments incorporated in the bill as they have been by
                a vote of the Senate. </p>

              <p>The substitute [Mr. Henry's] was agreed to by yeas, 31; nays, 15.</p>

              <p>The motion as amended by the substitute was adopted, and so the bill was
                recommitted. </p>

              <head rend="center"> SUFFERERS BY THE FLOOD.</head>

              <p> Mr. McINTOSH moved to take up the bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_414">H. R.
                  414</ref>] to appropriate $40,000 for the relief of sufferers on the Ohio, Wabash
                and White Rivers in the State of Indiana from the recent flood; that it be read the
                first time, the second time by title only and put upon its passage. He hoped the
                Senate would add $10,000 to the appropriation. </p>

              <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas, 44; nays, 0; accordingly the bill was read the
                first time, and the second time by title. [The Governor, Secretary and Auditor of
                State to disburse the money without delay.]</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN moved to add to the Board of Dispensation the Lieutenant Governor. </p>

              <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to increase the appropriation to $50,000. </p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE opposed the amendment. There will be a deficiency in the ensuing year.
                This bill was introduced this morning and hurried through the House. The expenditure
                of the money is not sufficiently guarded. While this appeals to the the impulses of
                our nature he opposed the passage of the bill without proper consideration. We are
                entitled to no credit for putting our hands into the State Treasury in this way. It
                is the people's money and not ours. Let us see,if the bill is to pass; that the
                people who deserve the money shall receive it, and that it shall not be dispense to
                undeserving. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES thought In a great emergency like this money should be appropriated from
                the State Treasury, The people will doubtless contribute liberally from their means,
                but it, will look niggardly unless this? Legislature make a liberal appropriation.
                To raise the captious question the money will not be properly distributed looks cap-
                nous. These sufferers call loudly for relief, and he thought no generous man or
                woman but would applaud the passage of this bill, even though it called for
                $100,000. </p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS would favor the amendment did he think it necessary-he favored a
                sufficient amount to meet the emergency. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN opposed the bill because it has in it concealed a communistic principle.
                Whenever any class want relief they knock at the doors of the State Treasury. We can
                not afford to make a bid precedent that shall go down the line of the ages. When any
                great disasters have overtaken people, when charity of their neighbors is appealed
                to relief will roll in and flood upon them until the suffering need no more. All
                over the country is bread, food and clothing being distributed to the people. This
                precedent is a dangerous one and ought not to be passed. The principle is wrong and
                the Senate ought to consider it well, </p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN hoped localities had nothing to do in in influencing Senators in voting
                upon this bill. Its passage will not be a precedent for the legislature hereafter to
                do an improper thing. At such a time as this tins kind of relief should be extended.
                The duty of Goverment is to protect her citizens. Man is not responsible for the act
                of God or a public enemy. He thought the $40,000 would carry the needed relief and
                hoped the amendment would lie withdrawn. He appealed to the Senate to ex- tend heart
                and hand to this measure. </p>

              <p>Mr. JOHNSON favored the bill but opposed the amendment, because its adoption would
                cause delay. If at any time delay is detrimental it is now. These sufferers hold up
                their arms imploringly for needed assistance, and he hoped not an hour's delay will
                be had.</p>

              <p>Mr. McINTOSH did not believe the amendment would delay the bill half an hour, and
                he hoped it would pass.</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN insisted not a good reason has been given for the passage of this bill.
                No man appreciated more than he the deserving objects of the bill, but it will not
                do to inaugurate a communistic principle. It is not because he did no: love these
                people who were his brothers and neighbors; it is only the principle he was fighting
                against. </p>

              <p>Mr. BELL thought there is a good deal of truth on both sides of this proposition.
                He should vote for the bill because of the great emergency-one unlikely to occur in
                the future. He acknowledged the principle to be a vicious one, but when emergency
                comes the eye is suffused and money flows like water to the relief of fellow
                sufferers. It is the easiest thing in the world to be generous with other people's
                money: but with this commission we may safely pass the bill. He opposed the
                amendment, believing the sum named in the bill sufficient for the present emergency.
                The public funds are not always raised by those able. Charity should come as the
                rain from Heaven, freely and unforbidden.</p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE supposed the bill would pass, but felt he must put his protest on record.
                He had as kindly a feeling for human kind as any Senator; but opposed anything like
                compelling charity. If this be a vicious principle, as acknowledged by the Senator
                from Allen [Mr. Bell], how can that Senator vote for the bill? We all had too good a
                knowledge of the generous people of this State to believe but that they would
                respond in abundant measure to their suffering brethren. If this precedent be
                established, every time a great fire or other calamity comes upon any people in this
                State, they will come here for relief and point to this precedent. The bill he
                regarded as unconstitutional, and should vote against it.</p>

              <p>Mr. CAMPBELL appreciated what has been said on both sides of this question. This is
                an unprecedented calamity, and he felt justified in voting, gladly, for such a
                measure of relief as this. </p>

              <p>Mr. ADKISON said the bill is not broad enough nor large enough. He would like to
                see it apply to every river in the State. The proposition is too narrow and the
                appropriation is too small. </p>

              <p>Mr. BELL hoped the money would be used only for the relief of physical suffering
                and personal want. Mr. VAN VORH1S was willing to take the responsibility of voting
                to help these sufferers. Citizens who will not contribute ought to be compelled by
                law to do so. </p>

              <p>Mr. WHITE felt his people would censure him were he not to favor this bill to
                relieve the suffering people of the State, though he opposed the amendment. </p>

              <p>The amendment increasing the appropriation to $50,000 was rejected by yeas, 7;
                nays, 37.</p>

              <p>Mr. SAYRE (explaining) would as lief vote for $100,000 as $40,000, but he would
                not, vote for the amendment now. If more money is necessary he stood ready to vote
                it. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to amend by adding a proviso that no more than $5,000 be
                appropriated for sufferers from overflow of the White River or Wabash River. </p>

              <p>Mr. SAYRE opposed any amendment on account of the delay.</p>

              <p> The amendment was rejected. </p>

              <p>Mr. MARVIN moved to strike out the words Wabash River and White River. </p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN knew no difference in the suffering wherever it is regardless of
                localities. There ought to be no distinctions. </p>

              <p>Mr. MARVIN had seen no report where the people on these rivers are suffering.</p>

              <p>The amendment was rejected. </p>
              <pb n="202" xml:id="VAA8558-21-201"/>

              <p>The bill was then read the third time and finally passed with the amendment adding
                the Lieutenant Governor to the Board of Disbursement by yeas, 39; days, 7.</p>

            on the part of the House and Senate be appointed to inquire into the necessity for
            relief of the sufferers from the Ohio River flood. </p>

          <p>Mr. JEWETT opposed the substitute and stated that these people are now in a suffering
            condition-wet, cold and hungry-and can not watt for the slow action of an investigation
            before there is legislation for their relief. On his motion the substitute; was laid on
            the table. </p>

          <p>Mr. STEWART thought there is no doubt of the existence of this suffering. He lived in a
            town on the Ohio River, but his town did not need any assistance. If we are going to do
            anything for these people it should be done at once. He hoped that a bill would be drawn
            up, introduced, and that the House would act on the same without delay. </p>

          <p>Mr. GIBSON had also received quite a number of dispatches from Jeffersonville relating
            to the suffering there, and he hoped that there would be no delay in the action of the
            House, </p>

          <p>Mr, WILSON, of Marion, offered an <sic>amendmendment</sic>, which was agreed to, that
            the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> report a bill forthwith providing for the
            relief of the sufferers. </p>

          <div type="section">

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN moved that the special order-the bill [H. R. 247]-for the incorporation
              of towns, etc., be taken up.</p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT opposed the motion to take up the special order. He felt that many members
              voted under a mistaken impression yesterday when they voted to pass over the
              consideration of the bill [H. R. 26] concerning promissory notes, bills of exchange,
              etc., and he believed that two-thirds of the members of the House desired to pass the
              bill. The bill has been before the House three times, and had each time been set
              aside. He thought that the motion for the special order should be voted down.</p>

            <p>Messrs. Patten, Gordon and Copeland spoke in favor of taking up the special
              order.</p>

            <p>The bill was taken up and read and the SPEAKER announced that it was ready for
              amendment.</p>

            <p>The <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> announced that it had prepared the bill
              for the relief of the sufferers of the Ohio River, which was, by the consent of the
              House, introduced, to-wit:</p>

            <p>By the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_414">H. R.
                414</ref>] to appropriate $40,000 for the relief of the sufferers from the recent
              floods of the Ohio River, and to appropriate from the general fund of the State not
              otherwise appropriated, and making the Governor, Secretary of State and Auditor a
              Board of Commissioners to dispense with the sum appropriated for said purpose, which
              was read the third time. </p>

            <p>Mr. STEWART moved that the Constitutional rules be suspended, that the bill be read
              the second time by title, be considered engrossed, read the third time by sections and
              put upon its passage. The motion was agreed to by yeas, 91; nays, 4. The bill was then
              read the second time. </p>

            <p>Mr, KENNEDY made an ineffectual motion to insert $50,000 hi place of $40,000.</p>

            <p>The amendment was rejected. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY offered an amendment making the provisions of the bill extend to all
              sufferers in the State from the recent floods.</p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN opposed the amendment. It was not necessary to extend this relief to every
              man who had lost a cabin or some cattle. In all such cases the neighbors could and
              would afford ample relief for the sufferers.</p>

            <p>Mr. FRAZER moved to recommit the bill with instructions that the words "other rivers"
              be inserted after the word "Ohio." </p>

            <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY moved to amend the amendment by inserting the words "Wabash and White
              Rivers." </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. JEWETT the motions to amend and recommit were laid on she table by
              yeas, 50; nays, 49.</p>

            <p>The bill was read a third time by section.</p>

            <p> Mr. MELLETT could see no reason if there are families suffering on the Wabash why
              these families should not be relieved by this Legislature a well as the families who
              are suffering from the waters of the Ohio River. </p>

            <p>Mr. HUSTON had not heard of any suffering from water, except from the Ohio River. He
              thought that the bill should pass for those who are hungry, cold and homeless.</p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELY was most heartily in favor of the bill, but after the rejection of such
              fair amendments as had been offered he would have to vote against the passage of the
              bill. He had letters in his pocket stating that persons were suffering from the
              overflow of the Wabash River. </p>

            <p>Mr. ANTRIM would like to see the bill, which he heartily indorsed, include the other
              rivers in this State. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN did not favor extending the pro' visions of the bill to other rivers than
              the Ohio, although the White and Wabash ran through his District.</p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON demanded the previous question.</p>

            <p>The House seconded the demand by yeas, 49; nays, 35, and under its operation the bill
              passed by yeas, 88; nays, 4.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT made an ineffectual motion to lay on the table this motion.</p>

            <p>The motion to reconsider was agreed to by yeas, 51; nays, 48 </p>

            <p> Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, insisted upon the right and justice of making the charities
              of this bill extend to the Wabash and White River Counties. The blue water of the
              White and the muddy waters of the Wabash are as cruel and relentless as those of the
              broad Ohio. The drowning <pb n="203" xml:id="VAA8558-21-202"/> woman's scream is the
              same terrible cry no matter whether it comes from the angry floods of one stream or
              the other. The starving child re a on the Wabash appeal as loudly for bread as do
              those from the Ohio. He regretted the bill came into the charge of gentlemen who
              prevented, through the operation of the previous question, debate, amendment or proper
              consideration. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT could not understand how any man who had a heart in his bosom could stop
              to raise objection to this measure, while the people on the Ohio were in such great
              distress and appealing to the Legislature for relief. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, regretted that there bad been any bad feeling raised on the
              question. He was satisfied that it arose from a misunderstanding of the facts. He
              slated that some 300 families were driven out of their houses near this city because
              of the high water, but the city of Indianapolis was able to take care of these people.
              He thought that if the people on the Wabash were in a suffering condition, and the
              people along that stream could not render them relief, and they should come to the
              Legislature with an appeal, that would immediately grant them. </p>

            <p>Mr. BOWERS stated that the city of Lawrenceburg is under water and many hundred
              people are driven from their homes. He hoped that the bill would not be delayed, and
              that it might pass at once. </p>

            <p>Mr. COPELAND objected to the amendment because the inhabitants of the White River and
              Wabash Valley regions have not asked for aid. He begged the gentlemen to turn their
              ears and hearts to the cry that comes up from the raging waters of the Ohio. Hundreds
              of our people have been driven from their homes, cold, desolate and hungry. The cry of
              hungry and despairing children rises to high Heaven asking for bread and shelter and
              clothing. Women with crying babes in their arms are Imploring us for aid: tottering
              old men with white locks are turned out of their homes in mid-winter at the mercy of
              wild winds and wilder waves; strong men with unlifted hands are begging and praying
              that the flood may roll back from the workshops and foundries that they may earn bread
              for their starving families. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELEY thought that the bill would receive the hearty endorsement of every
              member if the amendment was accepted. If the gentleman would accept the amendment the
              bill would pass the House in ten minutes. This amendment Is fair and reasonable, and
              the gentlemen who oppose it are the ones who are delaying the passage of what I
              consider a just and humane measure. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN spoke of the terrible suffering of these people from this great flood. He
              thought it was no time to stop and quibble about what might befall some other people,
              and delay the measure simply because it did not extend to some other people and some
              other region. These people are driven out of their homes by the remorseless flood and
              are praying for relief. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY did not think such legislation was right. He did not think they had any
              right to place their hands in the pockets of the State and take out this money for an
              appropriation. He favored extending the provisions of the bill so as to furnish relief
              to all persons in the State suffering from the recent flood. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN moved the previous question, which was not seconded by the House.</p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON moved that the bill be recommitted to a Special Committee of Two with
              Instructions to make its provisions extend to the flood sufferers from the Wabash and
              White Rivers, and to report in five minutes.</p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas, 72; nays. 19. </p>

            <p>This Committee was made to consist of Mr. Gibson and Mr. Frazer. </p>

            <p>Mr. MONTGOMERY, by consent, introduced a bill [H. R. 415] concerning the distribution
              of property, etc., which was read the first time. </p>

            <p>The Special Committee, to whom was referred the bill for the relief of the Ohio
              sufferers, reported that they had amended the bill as instructed. </p>

            <p>The report of the Committee was concurred in. </p>

            <p>Mr. HOWLAND regretted very much that the bill had been placed in a condition that he
              could not vote for it. No member of the House was more in favor of the bill, as first
              introduced, than he was. He was not in favor of adopting the amendment. </p>

            <p>Mr. TULEY had several dispatches in his pocket asking for relief, and though he did
              not favor adding the amendment to the bill, was willing to accept just what would be
              allowed. The people are driven from their houses and are camping upon the hillsides
              with nothing but a blanket to protect them from the cold. We have already wasted too
              much time on this matter. We are now willing to take what we can get. </p>

            <p>The amendment was adopted, the bill considered engrossed, and passed the House by
              yeas, 88; nays, 2. </p>

              appropriating $33,240 for a sewer from the Northern Prison to Fish Lake Creek, which

            <p>Mr. Bundy, as a member of the <orgName>Prison Committee</orgName> two years ago,

            <head rend="center">ADDITIONAL INSANE ASYLUMS.</head>

            <p>Mr. BELL called up the special order, being Mr. Graham's bill [S. 87] for the
              location of additional Insane Asylums one at. Evan^ville and one at Fort Wayne. </p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE moved to postpone the further consideration thereof till Tuesday next at 10
              o'clock, In view of the fact that the General Assembly is invited to visit Logansport
              next Saturday to return Sunday. It is but just to that locality that this motion
              should prevail.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES favored the motion, but doubted the propriety of building the additional
              Asylums at this time. He incidentally referred to a location in his District. </p>

            <p>Mr. RAHM introduced this bill over a month ago, and to postpone action now is simply
              to kill the bill. It is due to his interests that this bill should be acted on without
              further delay. Evansville moved in this matter last November, and now for other cities
              to arrange excursions looks like an effort to kill the bill, and it is unfair to
              postpone it further from time to time. There is a crying necessity for greater
              provision for the unfortunate insane now behind prison bars in the County Poor Houses
              all over the State. </p>

            <p>Mr. McCOLLOUGH also thought this bill should not be delayed for excursions. The
              incurably insane should be better provided for, as the Constitution demands, and the
              duty is imperative upon this Legislature to do something in that direction. </p>

            <p>Mr. WHITE, for the northern part of the State, spoke in favor of locating one of
              these Institutions at Elkhart-having the healthiest location and best water works in
              the northeast. He favored postponement.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY thought a majority of the Senate are in favor of locating one Asylum there,
              the other one being contended for by Fort Wayne and Logansport, and lately Elkhart has
              come in with a claim. He favored determining the question of location of one to-day,
              leaving the determination of the other till another time.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE was willing to that. </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY understands there is no way to back out of the excursion. That is a settled
              fact, There is an absolute necessity for additional Asylum for the incurably insane.
              Whether more than one shall be built now is another thing. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN favored Evansville as a place for one Asylum, but for the other place his
              mind is not made up. The bill ought to be dismissed on its merits to-day, but the
              question of location north of the National Road might be lets open.</p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS favored the motion to postpone, thinking it the view of many that the
              number should be greater, located at different places probably one in each
              Congressional District, making each District partially responsible for their
              management, under the control of the State. </p>

            <p> Mr. YOUCHE favored postponement, but not for the purpose of killing the bill, for he
              favored the erection of two Asylums. He desired time to consider the claims of places
              in the northern part of the State. The question as to what point in the northern part
              of the State an Asylum should be built, and as it is to be located for all time, great
              care and deliberation should be taken to canvass the question. It Evansville folk
              desire, <pb n="206" xml:id="VAA8558-21-205"/> not to kill this bill they had better
              not hurry it through too fast. </p>

            <p> Mr. GRAHAM did not believe either Evansville or Logansport geography the proper
              place. Logansport is more central for the northern portion of the State than Fort
              Wayne, and there are other places in the southern part of the State more central than
              Evansville. This location is to be permanent, and time enough should be taken to
              select with care. The grounds near the city belonging to the State would be a proper
              place and a far more economical place than any yet suggested. After next Tuesday there
              is ample time to decide upon a location, and he favored the motion to postpone.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL desired only to urge necessity for immediate action. As has been intimated
              by the Senator from Gibson [Mr. McCullough] the Constitution for thirty years
              has-demanded that provisions be made for the insane of the State, of which there are
              now more than 1,600 unprovided for. Yesterday when cry came up from sufferers by the
              flood, help was speedily granted, and how much sooner should the cry of those from
              whom the light of reason has forever fled? No action we can take will meet the hearty
              approval of the people of the State than to make immediate provision for this call of
              our unfortunate human beings. Those best informed say it is a mistake to mass the
              Asylums at one point, that better results can be obtained by building them at separate
              places. A comparison of management is a great advantage. Then upon the simple plea of
              economy. For transportation here from Fort Wayne each one brought costs $57, and
              friends desiring to visit inmates are put to great expense in coming from all over the
              State to one place. He thought the cottage system an excellent one. He favored as many
              additional facilities as could be obtained. Insane persons are now kept in this State
              in thirty-two places without clothing; in 108 places they are confined in cells; in
              twenty-two places in pens; in fourteen places they are wearing chains and balls; in
              twenty seven places they are fed through a wicket in an iron grate; in three places
              they are wearing handcuffs and in seven places they sleep on straw in cells. In two
              places they are controlled with the rod. </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE supposed there is no doubt of a necessity for additional buildings for the
              care of the insane. It is due to the State we should not consider the question of
              location until the claims of all cities applying shall be canvassed. This matter
              should not be disposed of now. A postponement till next Tuesday will not hazard the
              bill. Probably by that time inducements now unknown may be brought to the attention of
              the General Assembly. It may be sites may be donated or other things offered that
              would aid materially in the construction of the buildings. </p>

            <p>Mr. RISTINE favored the bill except the locations named therein. There was a
              proposition leaving the places vacant, which he favored, but a majority of the
              Committee insisted on inserting them. The postponement might endanger the passage of
              the bill. Let it be considered now- except the location feature. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN made a substitute motion that the bill to read the second time now, with
              the report of the Committee thereon, and the further consideration thereof be
              postponed till Tuesday at 10 o'clock. </p>

            <p>Mr. RAHM consented. He disclaimed any combination with Fort Wayne, declaring the
              location at Evansville to be decided on its merits solely. To-day it is the only city
              on the Ohio not suffering from the floods. </p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE was also willing to except the substitute motion.</p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS favored a larger number of Asylums, conceding the location to
              Evansville.</p>

            <p>The substitute motion was agreed to.</p>

            <p>Accordingly Mr. Rahm's bill [S. 87] to provide for the erection of an additional
              Asylum for the Insane at Evansville [on not less than 160 acres of land, with a
              capacity to accommodate 600 patients-see page 51-or may select several buildings-on
              what is called the "Cottage Plan;" as soon as any portion is completed patients may be
              received], was read the second time, with a recommendation of the <orgName>Reformatory
                Committee</orgName> for amendments providing for two such Asylums, one at Fort
              Wayne, in Allen County.</p>

            <p>The PRESIDENT pro tem. [Mr. Bundy in the Chair] declared the further consideration of
              the bill and report is postponed until Tuesday next at 10 o'clock, under the order of
              the Senate just adopted. </p>

              amend Section 4,524 of the R. S. so as to extend to all cities and town's the

            <head rend="center">ANOTHER JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.</head>

            <p>On motion by Mr. Marvin his bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_167">S. 167</ref>] to
              define the Twentieth Judicial Circuit and creating the Forty-third Judicial Circuit
              [Boone County the Twentieth and Clinton County the Forty-third] was read the third
              time. </p>

            <p>Mr. Mclntosh saw no necessity of making a Circuit out of these two Counties. </p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN, answering, read statistis of numerous Counties showing as in comparison
              these Counties were not asking too much-some having nine and four times the Court
              facilities. His people were active and energetic, which makes a difference in
              litigation. Those charged with crimes frequently have to lay in Jail sixty days. The
              Courts there are behind. It is unreasonable to expect one Court to do the business of
              his two thriving Counties. This change is badly needed as the business of the Courts
              is behind. </p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM favored the passage of the bill, a number of gentlemen having represented
              to him the necessity of this measure, which is but granting the right the Constitution
              says these Counties have. The Judge of that District is one of the most industrious,
              and yet he is unable to transact the business of the Circuit. New Circuits are- needed
              in many localities-one is needed in his District-and more will be created next
              session. </p>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON referred to the Constitutional guarantee that justice shall be
              administered freely and without delay, which in itself is a sufficient argument in
              favor of the passage of this bill. If the facts are as stated there should certainly
              be a new Circuit created, as proposed in this bill. </p>

            <p>Then came a recess till 2 o'clock. </p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>Mr. SAYRE desired to enter a protest against the passage of the bill. This session
              there has already been created two additional Circuit, Courts, and there may yet be
              other applications more deserving than the Counties of Clinton and Boone. He read a
              list of nearly twenty Counties having about as large or larger population than either
              the Counties affected by this bill having no more Court facilities. From an inspection
              of the docket of Boone County he had come to the: conclusion the measure is not
              absolutely needed. For these and other considerations he hoped this bill will not
              pass. </p>

            <p>The bill passed the Senate by yeas, 29; nays, 10.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. RISTINE his bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_170">S. 170</ref>] to

              <head rend="center">GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS.</head>

              <p> On motion by Mr. BELL the Senate resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of the
                  Whole</orgName> [Mr. Bell in the Chair] and resumed the consideration of the bill
                  <unclear reason="faded">[H. R. 30[?]]</unclear> making appropriations for the
                State Government and its institutions-commencing where the Committee left off

              <p>The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>'s amendment reducing the salary of the
                Deputy Attorney General from $1,000 to $600, and was agreed to. </p>

              <p>Mr. DUNCAN moved to increase the sum for office expenses of the Superintendent of
                Public Instruction from $500 to $600. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD opposed the amendment. </p>

              <p>Mr. DUNCAN offered this amendment at the request of both the outgoing and incoming
                Superintendent of Public Instruction.</p>

              <p> Mr. HENRY stated that $600 was appropriated last year and all was expended.</p>

              <p>Mr. WHITE also insisted $600 was necessary.</p>

              <p>The amendment was agreed to. </p>

              <p>Mr. JOHNSTON said the janitor of the State Library also acted as janitor of the
                Agricultural Bureau, and his compensation should be commensurate with his duties. He
                made an ineffectual motion to increase the salary from $500 to $900. </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY made an ineffectual motion to increase the pay of the State Librarian
                night watchman from $500 to $900.</p>

              <p>The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>'s amendment to reduce the sum for office
                and chamber expenses of the Supreme Court from $2,000 to $1,500.</p>

              <p>Mr. SAYRE is informed $2,000 is absolutely necessary, and he opposed the
                amendment.</p>

              <p>Mr. Graham also understood this sum should not be reduced below $2,000. One Judge
                has occupied his room one year without the carpet "being taken up.</p>

              <p>Mr. Van Vorhis was of opinion this would be parsimony instead of economy.</p>

              <p>Mr. White felt a curtailment would cripple the Judges.</p>

              <p>Mr. Willard reminded the Senate that it was only in 1881 that the appropriation was
                increased to $2,000.</p>

              <p> The amendment was agreed to but this vote was subsequently reconsidered on motion
                by Mr. Henry. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN moved to increase the salary of Assistant Librarian from $750 to $1,000,
                as justice to a woman who will do the work and have a good share of the
                responsibility. </p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE conceding what is stated, but opposed the amendment. </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY moved to amend the amendment by making the sum $900. </p>

              <p>His amendment to the amendment was agreed to as was also the amendment as amended. </p>

              <p>The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>'s amendment to make $360 the pay of the
                Messenger of the Supreme Court instead of $600, as in the bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS said this man does some clerical work in addition to his duties, but
                on general principles if the man is worth no more than that, the item had better be
                stricken out, </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY understood this messenger's duty is to carry books from the library to
                the Judges. </p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY saw no necessity for employing a full grown man for such light
                duties.</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN preferred to see a place abolished if not worth paying for.</p>

              <p>The Committee amendment was rejected.</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. SAYRE the sum for salaries of Circuit Judges was increased $7,500
                to pay the three additional Circuit Judges created this session. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE moved to make one of the three janitors provided for in the bill under
                the charge and appointed by the Judges of the Supreme Court.</p>

              <p>The amendment was agreed to. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN moved ineffectually to increase the salaries of Prosecuting Attorneys
                from $500 to $1,000.</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. MARVIN the sum for Prosecuting Attorneys was increased $1,500 for
                the three new offices created this session. </p>

              <p>The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> amendment, to strike out the appropriation
                for clothing for the insane, $22,000, being read-</p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE stated since the Committee acted upon this the Superintendent of the
                Asylum contends this should not be taken from the bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS moved as a substitute for the Committee amendment a change of
                wording so as to make the appropriation in gross. There is no reason for counting
                these items in separate accounts. This is the view of the Superintendent of the
                Insane Asylum. Two years ago Mr. V. made an effort to have these sums stated in
                gross. They ought to be so considered. </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY saw no reason why these accounts be put in gross. </p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH, of Delaware, understands the Committee reconsidered this act. </p>

              <p>Mr. DAVIDSON, learning that appropriation was necessary, is satisfied the amendment
                was a mistake. </p>

              <p>Mr. Voyles insisted the bill passed this session does not increase their salaries.

                said students to connect themselves with any College Secret Society they may desire;
                and a like statement shall be filed with the Auditor before each quarterly warrant
                is drawn; being read-</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD delivered a set speech in support of the Committee amendment as follows
                : </p>

              <p> MR. P<hi rend="sc">RESIDENT</hi>-As the author of the proviso which has been
                unanimously reported from the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>, and as a
                member of that Committee in charge of the appropriation bill, it is proper that I
                should give the reasons for the amendment proposed I desire in advance to state to
                the Senate that I have no personal inter- est in this matter whatever, as the only
                Greek fraternities into which I ever had the honor to be initiated, so far as I am
                aware, have never sought to establish a chapter in Indiana. But none the less warmly
                is every impulse of my nature in sympathy with this proviso. The object of the
                proviso is almost too well known in the Senate to <pb n="208"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-21-207"/> require explanation. Its purpose is to declare by solemn
                legislative enactment that the faculty of Purdue University shall not trample on the
                civil liberty of students in that Institution, whether citizens, or minors.</p>

              <p>It proposes to declare in the most emphatic term in which this General Assembly can
                enunciate it, that and hobby-riding shall have no place in the advanced education
                which we are laboring to bestow on rich and poor alike in Indiana. It is indeed
                strange, Mr. Chairman, that in this, our advanced civilization, in a State which has
                the finest system of common schools on the continent, a legislator should be forced
                to insist that the blessings of civil liberty and freedom of thought shall not be
                denied to any citizen of Indiana. </p>

              <p>One would think from the necessity which has given rise to this proviso that we
                were groping in dark ages of the past, under a despotic Government, rather than
                breathing the free air of Heaven in a State whose educational system is the pride
                and boast of her citizens. Nevertheless, the necessity is imperative. The
                Constitution of Indiana guarantees that "no law shall restrain any inhabitants of
                the State from assembling together in a peaceable manner to consult for their common
                good." Certainly no educational institution which is supported in party by the State
                will be permitted to invade this, one of the dearest rights of citizenship, simply
                because a fossilized faculty is imbued with the quintessence of craukism. The
                students of Purdue, who are so unfortunate as to be tyranized over by these
                antediluvian fanatics, know Their rights and have dared to assert them. </p>

              <p>I purpose to briefly review the contest between the friends of civil liberty on the
                one side and the monomaniac faculty of Purdue up in the other. An application was
                made in the Tippecanoe Circuit Court in the name of the State of Indiana: on the
                relation of Stallard vs. White and others for a mandamus to compel the faculty of
                Purdue to admit a student, otherwise qualified, but who refused to sign what is
                known as the "Purdue Greek Fraternity pledge." The point in question was "whether a
                public institution supported in pa by the State could require any person, either a
                citizen or minor, to agree to abide by this rule of Purdue as a condition precedent
                to his entering the Institution. The rule alluded to is in the following
                language:</p>

              <p>3. "No student is permitted to join or be connected with any so-called Greek or
                other College secret society, and as a condition of admission to the University or
                promotion therein each student is required to give a written pledge that he or she
                will observe this regulation. A violation of this regulation and pledge forfeits the
                right of any student to class promotion at the end of the year and to an honorable
                dismissal."</p>

              <p>Upon a hearing of the cause before Judge Vinton, of The Tippecanoe Circuit Court,
                the writ of mandate was dented to the plaintiff and an appeal was promptly prayed to
                the Supreme Court. While this appeal was being taken, and while as yet the case was
                not decided by the Supreme Conn, the extremely conscientious, high-minded and
                honorible President of Purdue, whose hair stands erect in horror at the very mention
                of a secret society, by a species of chicanery which would disgrace a pettifogger in
                a Police Court endeavored to bias the action of the Supreme Court by an official
                report to the Governor of the State in which he uses the following language: </p>

              <p>"It is not feared that Judge Vinton's decision will be reversed by the Supreme
                Court of the State, and hence the validity of the Purdue regulation prohibiting
                connection with College secret societies may be considered as judicially
                settled."</p>

              <p> At the time those words were penned by the President of Purdue he well knew that
                nothing whatever was settled by a Circuit Court decision from which an appeal had
                been prayed to the Supreme Court, and his futile attempt to bias a Court can only be
                considered the chattering nonsense of a blind fanatic, or else a willful
                misrepresention in an official report. He may take whichever horn of the dilemma he
                choses, but notwithstanding this insinuating effort on the part of the President of
                Purdue, the Supreme Court, decided the case upon its merits. I desire to quote from
                the decision: "But the possession of this great power over a student after he has
                entered the University does not justify the imposition of either detracting or
                extraordinary terms as a condition of admission into it, nor does it justify
                anything which may be construed as an invidious discrimination against an applicant
                on account of his previous membership in any one of the Greek fraternities,
                conceding their characters, objects and aims to be what they are averred to be in
                the complaint." So much for the case which th e President of Purdue so boldly
                announced in advance was practically settled. But the Faculty of Purdue were not
                satisfied: they passed for a rehearing: they wanted more, and they got more than
                they wanted. The Court granted the rehearing, and then reaffirmed their former
                decision with this addition: "In legal effect we have only decided that Regulation
                No. 3, adopted by the Faculty, and the special pledge tendered to Hawley fairly
                implied a discrimination against a class of the inhabitants of this State as much
                entitled to admission in the University as any other class, and that to that extent,
                that regulation and that special pledge were both unlawful and unreasonable." </p>

              <p> "When an inhabitant of the State has acquired the right of admission into a Public
                School, and that right has been unjustly denied, he is as much injured as if some
                important property right had been invaded, and as much entitled to appeal to the
                Courts for relief. This has been settled by innumerable precedents and decided
                cases, and is no longer an open question. It is equally the duty of Courts to grant
                relief against the enforcement of unjust and unreasonable regulation for the
                government of Public Schools after questions of admission have been disposed of." In
                this you perceive that the Court went even further than in its original decision,
                and says in fact that it is the duty of the Court to take cognizance of rules of
                this kind, whether they be precedent to admission or refer to the subsequent
                continuation of the student in the University. Now, how did the faculty of Purdue
                receive this decision of the Supreme Court? Did they submit to tit with good grace
                like law-abiding citizens? Did they bow with respect to the Supreme Judicial
                authority of the State and endeavor to right the wrong they had done to the students
                under their charge? Far from it. They assembled together and concocted a subterfuge
                that scarcely serves even to disguise their contempt by the Supreme Court of
                Indiana. Let me inform the Senate of the action they took. They adopted the
                following rules and pledge:</p>

              <p> 2. No student shall join or have any active connection as a member or otherwise
                with any so-called Greek fraternity or other College secret society or with any
                other students' society not authorized by the faculty, and as a condition of
                graduation or honorable dismission, students shall be required to sign a written
                statement that they have complied with this regulation.</p>

              <p> 6. As a condition of admission to the University or any department therein, o
                re-entrance, students shall be required to subscribe to the foregoing regulations
                and all other regulations of the University relating to obligation and duties of
                students, and promise a faithful compliance therewith during their connection; that
                is, until dismissed or graduated.</p>

              <p> "Pledge (to be signed by student): I hereby subscribe to the foregoing
                regulations, and all other regulations of Purdue University which re<pb n="209"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-21-208"/>late to the duties and obligations of students, and I
                promise on my honor a faithful compliance therewith during the University year,
                ending June 30 next." </p>

              <p>In this way the faculty of Purdue re-imposed upon the students the very rule which
                the Supreme Court had termed degrading and extraordinary. These rules assume to
                establish a condition subsequent to admission of a condition precedent, but in truth
                and in fact they establish a condition precedent by making the student pledge his
                honor to abide by the condition subsequent. This is the most bold-faced and impudent
                attempt to evade Supreme Judicial authority that I have ever known, either in this
                State or any other. The faculty of Purdue have placed themselves in shameless' and
                open contumacy of the Supreme Court, and defiantly challenge its powers, and did the
                law of civil procedure permit it, I doubt not they would" be summoned for contempt
                and allowed to cool their fevered fanaticism inside the cold walls of a common Jail
                until they had purged themselves of their contempt. This is the history of the
                struggle which the students of Purdue have made against the oppression which crushes
                them down. You ask, perhaps, why do they not again go into the Courts? Why do they
                not compel the faculty to abandon their heinous and degrading regulation? Remember,
                Senator, that these students are many of them young boys, poor perhaps, and unable
                to bear the heavy expenses which an appeal of cases to the Supreme Court necessarily
                entails, and what assurance will they have that another contest will not be followed
                by another attempted evasion ? They have been victorious in the Courts but it has
                been of little avail, and, therefore, they come to you as the representatives of the
                people, and they have the right to make their appeal to you. They ask you to relieve
                them from these regulations, which the Supreme Court has pronounced to be degrading.
                They ask you to burst the shackles which bind their consciences, They ask you to
                relive them of the infamous pledge which dishonors their man hood. They ask you to
                say, through the medium of legislation, that you will not permit an class of the
                inhabitants of this State to be held in moral slavery by any combination of men
                what- soever. They ask to be relieved from the ignominious and insensate mandates of
                a cabal which can be most fitly characterized in the words of the most varsatile of
                English literati, "men who are a type of those never to-be-forgoten times of cold
                hearts and narrow minds-the golden age of the coward, the bigot and the slave. And
                these students have the right to appeal to you. It was a right guaranteed to them by
                their fathers, and that it might never be disregarded it was placed in the supreme
                law of the State in these words: "Knowledge and learning generally diffused
                throughout a community being essential to the preservation of a free Government, it
                shall be the duty of the General Assembly to encourage by all suitable means moral,
                intellectual, scientific and agricultral improvement, and to provide by law for a
                general and uniform system of Common Schools, where tuition shall be without charge
                and equally open to all." </p>

              <p> Every Senator upon this floor is aware that it is under this provision of the
                Constitution that aid has repeatedly been granted to the State University, the
                Normal School and Purdue University, and to the credit of the other Institutions be
                it said that Purdue has been the only one to violate the Constitution of Indiana as
                expounded by the Supreme Court of the State. </p>

              <p> I appeal to you, my fellow Senators, to right this wrong. I appeal to you not to
                close your ears to the demand of the down-trodden students of Purdue University. I
                appeal to every liberty-loving sentiment which animates your bosoms, I appeal to you
                Republicans whose hearts thrill with just pride when you recall, as the grandest
                achievement of the greatest representative of your party, the striking off the
                fetters from the limbs of 4,000,000 enslaved, and I ask you are you ready to
                maintain a species of moral slavery right here in the free State of Indiana? I do
                not believe it.</p>

              <p> I appeal to my Democratic friends, members of a party which has survived so many
                successive defeats only because it is founded on inalienable and unchangeable
                principles, and I ask you, are you going to deny the prayer of the oppressed in
                utter disregard of the fundamental principle enunciated by the founder of our party,
                "equal and exact justice to all men?" </p>

              <p>Again I appeal to yon as Senators acting under the obligation of a solemn oath, and
                I ask you, are you going to disregard the sacred provision of the Constitution that
                the system of Common Schools shall be equally open to all. Are you going to say that
                a man who joins a Greek fraternity should be classed in the same category as a
                criminal, that he shall not be accorded the-same liberty as other inhabitants of
                this State? Why, what are the Greek fraternities?</p>

              <p> If you listen to the drivel of the President of Purdue, you would suppose that
                they were the offspring of Satan and the damned. Away with such fanaticism. These
                fraternities have numbered in their catalogues the grandest names in American
                history in the nineteenth century. You find their members in every assemblage of
                educated men. As I look around upon my colleagues, I find that well nigh half of
                them have experienced their blessings and known their worth. They throw around the
                young man just entering collegiate life the most secure protection imaginable. He
                leaves his home, doubting, hesitating, untried, inexperienced, totally unfamiliar
                with the ways of the world, and when be enters the fraternity he finds himself amid
                a brotherhood whose older members will guide and counsel him. He finds himself
                protected, advised, admonished, urged onward in the pathway of ambition, while his
                course is regarded with the most affectionate solicitude and brotherly care. He
                finds himself at once admitted</p>

              <lg>
                <l>"To a sphere where love's the center,</l>
                <l>Where all hate and envy cease,</l>
                <l>Where dissensions never enter</l>
                <l>To a fellowship of peace.</l>
                <l>Each for every other caring </l>
                <l>Learns his brother's good to prize,</l>
                <l>With his brother honor sharing-</l>
                <l>Every honor multiplies."</l>
              </lg>

              <p>The Greek fraternities train the student by the art of criticism into habits of
                correct thought. They teach him the first rudiments of political maneuvering. They
                give him new and broader ideas of humanity. They elevate him in all that constitutes
                true manhood. These fraternities form the green oases in the dreary desert of
                collegiate labor. For myself I can say that the Greek fraternities into which I had
                the honor to be initiated, accomplished for me fully as much as the collegiate
                course itself. And in after days, when fighting the battle of life, in the pauses of
                the contest; with what fond remembrance does the mind look back and dwell upon
                fraternity experience! I have experienced the beneficent influence of the Greek
                fraternities, and never shall my voice be silent when they are assailed until my
                tongue is stilled in death.</p>

              <p>But there is another aspect, in which this question should be viewed. What means
                this sudden attempt to engraft into the youthful mind the belief that a secret
                society is simply a league with hell? Are we going back to the dead issues of the
                palmy days of Thurlow Weed, and attempting to revive the spirit of Morganism in the
                land?</p>

              <p>Are we expending the money of the State that the worn out so-called priciples of
                the anti-Masonry party may be instilled into the minds of the young? If so I, for
                one am ready to call a <pb n="210" xml:id="VAA8558-21-209"/> halt and say that rot
                one single cent of the money the State shall be expended for the inculcation of such
                pernicious doctrines. You can never eradicate an innate principle from the human
                mind. The tendency of men to associate themselves together in secret societies is a
                part of human nature I challenge all history to disprove the assertion. The records
                of secret societies are found engraven in stone amid the hieroglyphics of the
                Rameses. The songs of these orders were chanted beneath the hanging gar- dens of
                Babylon; they were re-echoed along the shores of the Aegean in the Elusinian
                mysteries: they were heard again in the Vehm Gericht of Germany and Burgundy, and
                finally in our own times they are echoed and re-echoed in every Clime and beneath
                every sky-</p>

              <lg>
                <l>"Where'er the sun</l>
                <l>Does his successive journeys run."</l>
              </lg>

              <p> The influence of the secret society is to-day well nigh forming a brotherhood of
                mankind as the various orders extend their power. The secret orders are cementing
                and uniting humanity in a "solid phalanx of friendship, which no foe can sever,
                neither can the gates of hell prevail against it." </p>

              <p>They are hastening that day of universal brotherhood which the Scottish bard, with
                fatidical eye, foresaw more than a century ago and prophesied in his grandest
                poem.</p>

              <p> Mr. Chairman, I sincerely trust that the proviso may be adopted by such a decisive
                majority as shall thoroughly and finally settle this question for the future. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE called attention to the fact that the proposed amendment would be a
                special act applying to Purdue University alone. Under some circumstances a proviso
                of this kind might not be very disadvantageous to a University, but prompted as this
                is by spite, and backed as it is by a speech in which personal vituperation of the
                President of that Institution has been a prevailing motive for the passage of such a
                proviso at such a time, it can be nothing more nor less than a stab at that College,
                and nothing more nor less than an insult to the gentlemen who constitute the Board
                of Trustees, the President an el Faculty of an Institution that has done a great
                deal of good in this State. Who is it that makes a complaint, and who is it that
                appeals to the Senate on behalf of these down-trodden students? </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD stated that he had in his possession over thirty letters from the
                students playing for this prohibition, and every one of them telling him that they
                would be expelled if their names were revealed.</p>

              <p>Mr. YOUCHE opposed the amendment, although'belonging to one of the honorable and
                ancient Greek fraternities that have chapters in this State. When voting on such
                questions we should rise above all considerations but what is for the best interests
                of the State. He favored the public interest and would not vote to saddle a rider of
                this kind on the bill which would put it in the power of one man to rob the people
                of the State from benefits that might be derived from this school. </p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. SPANN the Committee rose, reported progress and asked leave to sit
                at 2 o'clock to-morrow. </p>

              <p>The Senate concurred in the report. </p>

            <p>By Mr. Carr, by consent, [H. R. 418] to legalize the incorporation of the town of
              Cherabusco, Whitley County.</p>

            <p>By Mr. Jewett, by consent, [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_419">H. R. 419</ref>] to
              appropriate the sum of $100,000 from the general fund, not otherwise appropriated, for
              the relief of the sufferers from the floods of the Ohio, Wabash and White Rivers. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT stated the amount appropriated on yesterday is wholly inadequate to
              relieve the distress, and that he had in his possession several dispatches from the
              deluged districts which he desired to have read. The dispatches being read, he moved
              that the House take up and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill [<ref
                target="#HB_1883_01_04_414">H. R. 414</ref>] to provide $40,000 for the relief of
              the Ohio, Wabash and White River sufferers. </p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to by consent. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT moved that the Constitutional rules be suspended and that his bill [<ref
                target="#HB_1883_01_04_419">H. R. 419</ref>] be read the second time by title. He
              would like to have an appropriation of $100,000 for the sufferers, but if that amount
              would not be appropriated, he desired to get as large an appropriation as the measure
              would allow. He explained the condition of affairs at New Albany in particular paying
              an exceedingly large number of the houses were small cottages, one story in height,
              and as these are flooded the people have absolutely no place to go, and many families
              depend upon the work of the mother for sustenance.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, said the safest way would be to pass the bill to a second
              reading and leave it in that condition for the present, and until the present
              appropriation is distributed. </p>

            <p>The motion to suspend the rules and read the bill the second time by title was agreed

              the flood of the Ohio. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY was of the opinion that the State of Indiana could provide ample means
              of relief for all sufferers within her borders, and as other States could do the same

            <head rend="center">COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS.</head>

            <p>The SPEAKER announced the special order to be Mr. Stucker's bill [H. R. 186] to amend
              Section 33 of an act providing for the election of County Superintendents.</p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELY moved to amend the bill so as to limit the number of days to which any
              County Superintendent should be entitled to 180 in a year. Mr. S. was of the opinion
              that no public functionaries had so much abused the privileges H their office as had
              the County Superintendents, often as asking pay for more days than there are in the
              year. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY was very sorry to be at variance with the gentleman from Wabash [Mr.
              Shively] He considered this one of the most important offices in the County. In his
              County he was satisfied that the County Superintendent could put in every working day
              of the year in a manner that would be valuable to the interest of their schools. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, and Mr. CAMPBELL were opposed to the amendment. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. CAMPBELL the amendment was laid on the table.</p>

            <p>Mr. SUTTON moved to amend by allowing the Superintendent in Counties of 15,000
              inhabitants and under, $500 per annum; in Counties of more than 15,000 inhabitants and
              under 20,000, $600 per annum; in Counties of more than 20,000 and less than 30,000
              inhabitants. $750 per annum: in all Counties of more than 30,000 Inhabitants, $750 per
              annum. </p>

            <p>Mr. SUTTON thought this would be an equitable adjustment of the matter, and spoke in
              favor of its adoption. </p>

            <p>Mr. STUCKER was opposed to the amendment. He desired the bill to come before the
              House that the members might vote upon it without any amendments. </p>

            <p>The amendment was laid on the table. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, made an ineffectual motion to amend the bill so as to limit
              the number of days any County Superintendent to 180 days in which to visit
              schools.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. Jewett the bill was laid on the table by yeas, 53; nays, 37. </p>

            <p>Mr. WRIGHT, from the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, reported back Mr.
              Howland's bill [H. R 178] concerning the duties and power of County Commissioners, and
              requiring them to give bonds with no recommendation.</p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed. He considered this a radical
              change in the office of County Commissioner. Never in the history of the State had
              County Commissioners been compelled to give bonds. He thought that the members of the
              Legislature had just as well required to give bonds as to require County Commissioners
              to do so. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, thought that every ministerial officer should be required to
              give bond. He believed that in the allowance of claims, end in the amounts allowed the
              County Attorneys, the Commissioners very frequently should be liable on a bond. He
              moved that the motion to indefinitely postpone be laid on the table. </p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY concurred in what the gentleman from Marion [Mr. Wilson] had said. He
              was in favor of the County Commissioners giving bond. </p>

            <p>Mr. MELLETT opposed the proposition of requiring the County Commissioners to give
              bond. Bethought you had just as well require the Judges of the Circuit Court to give
              bond and thereby render them liable on every decision rendered. Under the provision of
              this bill, should it become a law, no sit man could be induced to accept the office of
              County Commissioner. </p>

            <p>Mr. SUTTON said: This is unquestionably a good measure, and should become a law. It
              would prevent undue and hasty action on the part of Commissioners, and when they
              knowingly violate the law in allowing unjust and extortionate claims their action
              might be adjudicated upon and they be held responsible upon their bonds. </p>

            <p>Mr. ADAMS moved to amend by requiring the action for damages to be brought in the
              name of the State on the relation of the Attorney General. </p>

            <p>The amendment was accepted by the author of the bill [Mr. Howland].</p>

              <head rend="center">FEMALE REFORMATORY SEWER.</head>

              <p>The SPEAKER announced the first special order to be Mr. Wilson, of Marion's, bill
                  [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_052">H. R. 52</ref>] to construct a sewer from the
                Female Reformatory to connect with a sewer in the cty of Indianapolis.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILSON explained the necessity of this bill, stating that a suit had been
                brought by the Federal Government in the United Stales Court of this District to
                abate the nuisance of The sewarage passing through the Arsenal Grounds, and, the
                Court was Just waiting to see what action the Legislature would take before
                proceeding with the abatement. The State is a party to this suit, and, unless
                something is done the Institution, will be closed, and the expense the State has
                incurred in creating the Institution would be an entire loss. He further stated that
                the cost of the sewer would be, as he was informed, something less than $30,000,
                while the loss to the State by refusing to construct the sewer would be more than
                $100,000.</p>

              <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY was of the opinion that the city of Indianapolis was to receive some
                of the benefit of this sewer should it be constructed and therefore thought that the
                city should pay a portion of the expense. He had been informed that the property to
                be drained by the sewer was not worth more than the sewer. He was opposed to the
                passage of the bill-at present, and made an ineffectual motion to postpone the
                further consideration until to-morrow at 2 o'clock.</p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe. considered this a very necessary work. The State had
                already appropriated one hundred and thirty thousand dollars to this Institution,
                and it would not do to refuse this appropriation as provided in the bill and incur
                the loss of the entire amount appropriated. </p>

              <p>Mr. HEFFREN thought the only question before the House was whether or not the State
                would protect its own property. This Reformatory is a State Institution, and it is
                not a question of benefiting some one else, but it is a question of protecting an
                institution of the State. </p>

              <p>Mr. MOODY felt that if the members were not, fully acquainted with the provisions
                of the bill it was their fault, and not the fan It of the persons, who are urging
                the passage of the bill. Suppose this sewer does benefit the city of Indianapolis
                  <pb n="212" xml:id="VAA8558-21-211"/> it is an absolute annihilation of one of the
                State Institutions if this sewer is not constructed. He toped that the bill would
                pass immediately, and allow an opportunity to take up some other legislation, </p>

              <p>Mr. STEWART occupied the same position in regard to this matter at the beginning of
                the previous General Assembly as the gentlemen who are now hesitating about passing
                this bill. He was not sure that the selection of the present site for the location
                of this Institution was a wise one; but since the State had incurred the expense of
                erecting the buildings and the other expenses necessary to establish the
                Institution, it would not pay to allow the Institution to be closed simply to save
                the necessary appropriation of $30,000 required to build this sewer. He considered
                it a matter of economy, and felt that the money in the hands of the proper persons
                would be judiciously expended. He urged the necessity of immediate action upon the
                question. </p>

              <p>Mr. FLEECE stated that ii; was not for the benefit of the city, but it was
                exclusively for the use of the State, and that the sewerage coming down from this
                Institution through the small creek, as it does at present, was the cause of much
                sickness to persons living along this stream. He favored the passage of the
                bill.</p>

              <p>M. MELLETT desired to say to the House that there are provisions in the bill that
                he could not favor. He was not us fully informed on the question as he would like to
                be. Under the circumstances he thought there was but one thing to do and that was to
                construct the sewer. </p>

              <p>Mr. ADAMS was not informed concerning the provisions of the bill, and did not like
                to vote for i a measure until he fully understood it. It might be his own fault, but
                this was the first time he had seen the bill. He thought the bill should provide for
                a commission to decide whether or not the city of Indianapolis is to be benefited by
                the construction of this sewer. He was of the opinion that the next Legislature,

              <p>The Speaker announced the next special order to be Mr. Wiley's bill [H. R, 39] r,o
                provide for the election of a reporter of the Supreme Court, etc., allowing $2.50
                per copy for reports of the Supreme Court.</p>

              <p> Mr. SMITH considered the passage of the bill about equivalent to closing up the

              <p>Mr. HEFFREN stated that the reports cost less than half the sum allowed the

              <p>Mr. MOCK was of the opinion that the reporter of the Supreme Court would clear not

                regulation of stock running at large, was read the third time.</p>

              <p>Mr. PATTEN opposed the passage of the bill, considering the present law sufficient.
                He thought the present bill would impose hardships upon the farming communities, and
                create innumerable lawsuits, without benefiting anyone in the least. </p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT was opposed to the bill because it recognized the principle that co one
                but a freeholder should have a voice under its provisions, He considered every man
                entitled to a voice, whether he was a freeholder or not. He was not seeking to
                influence others' votes, but there were the reasons why he could not support the
                bill.</p>

              <p>Mr. MONTGOMERY thought the people of this State are satisfied with the present law,
                and was therefore opposed to the bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. HOLLER believed the bill would create legislation, and for that reason opposed
                it. </p>

              <p>Mr. Mutz was opposed to changing the present law.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILSON. of Koscinsko, also opposed the passage of this bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. McHENRY regarded this bill as against the interests of the poorer class of
                farmers.</p>

              <p>Mr. DEEM thought this bill in the interest of large and against the interest of
                small farmers, and hoped it would be voted down.</p>

              <p>Mr. THOMAS believed his constituents are opposed to this bill and consequently
                should vote against it. </p>

              <p>Mr. SUTTON was sure this bill places the matter in the hands of those most

            <p>Mr. MACARTNEY explained it was to remedy a defect in the present law, which is a bid
              to delinquents to put off paying tax liens on real estate. There is no reason why a
              less per cent. should be paid after the expiration of two years than before. The bill
              makes a uniform penalty of 10 per cent. and does not apply to tax sales made

            <p> Mr. Duncan'R bill [S. 66] to amend Section 4,424 of the Revised Statutes of 1881,
              concerning the election of County Superintendents.</p>

            <p>Mr. DUNCAN explained the bill provides for a four years' term instead of a two years'
              term as now, which will obviate an objection to the present mode of selection because
              one-half of the Trustees will have nothing to do with electing a School
              Superintendent. The bill also provides that if the Trustees fail to make a selection
              on the day named in the law, they may meet en a succeeding day and ballot until they
              have selected a Superintendent. The first election to be in June next. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN favored the bill, but thought the office of School Superintendent the most
              worthless office known, and it ought to be abolished. </p>

            <pb n="214" xml:id="VAA8558-21-213"/>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM concurred in the appreciation of the office just expressed. There is a
              great amount of fraud perpetuated by these officers, and there is no good reason
              apparent why the term of such an office should be extended. The Board of Trustees of
              incorporated towns should have a voice in the selection of County Superintendents. He
              moved to recommit the bill to a Special Committee, with instructions to amend.</p>

            <p> Mr. BELL opposed the motion. The principle is viscous and would be giving towns more
              control than they ought to have. Two years ago this proposition was considered and
              rejected.</p>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGASS would favor the motion in the interest of politics of his
              neighborhood, were politics to govern his vote. But he opposed it, believing the
              principle to be wrong. The County Superintendent has no control over town schools, and
              it would be unfair and unjust to give a representation to the town Trustees in the
              selection of a County Superintendent. He favored the bill as it is, and hoped it would
              pass in the interest of the glorious school system of Indiana. </p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE demanded the previous question.</p>

            <p>It was seconded, and under its operations the motion to recommit was rejected by
              yeas, 15; nays, 29.</p>

            <p>The bill failed to pass by yeas, 25; nays, 18, for want of a constitutional majority.

              of the act to establish a State Bureau of Statistics-see page 196 of the Brevier
              Reports-being read the third time, </p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN opposed the bill because the only object is to legislate out Republicans
              and put in Democrats. If gentlemen will point out one act of dishonest on the part of
              any man connected with the Bureau of Statistics he would vote for the bill. It is an
              iniquity and an outrage, and no precedent has ever been set in the State of Indiana
              for such action.</p>

            <p> Mr. MAGEE stated in the discussion the other day he had said on information that the
              chief of one of these Bureaus used the office for partisan purposes, and as an
              attachment to the <orgName>State Central Committee</orgName>. He has been assured
              since that such is not the fact, and this information comes from such trustworthy
              source that he wished to withdraw that imputation upon a gentleman he does not know.
              He made the statement in good faith, and now makes the retraction. He then demanded
              the previous question.</p>

            <p>The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question by yeas 28, nays 19, and

            <p>The question recurring; Shall the bill pass?</p>

            <p>Mr. McINTOSH: If every householder were able to pasture his own stock on his own land

              pounds on wagon tires of less than four inches in width, between November 15 and May
              15, on gravel, macadamized or plank roads, except when the ground is frozen
              sufficiently to bear up such a weight, was read the third time.</p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN spoke in favor of the passage of his bill; In his County thousands of
              dollars had been destroyed by driving heavy loads over newly made roads. The bill is
              almost an exact copy of the Ohio law on this subject. </p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM did not believe this bill should pass. Where there are toll roads they
              must be kept up and in repair or tolls can not be taken. The authorities should keep
              roads in repair so that teamsters required to haul heavy loads may not be compelled to
              give up their occupation. </p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS thought when roads are furnished free at all times of the year it is
              not asking too much that in certain seasons the roads should be protected from such
              burdens as would destroy them. </p>

              <head rend="center">GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>

              <p> On motion by Mr. BELL the Senate resolved itself into a <orgName>Committee of the
                  Whole</orgName> [Mr. Bell in the Chair] and resumed the consideration of the
                general appropriation bill [H. R. 302] the question being on the amendment proposed
                by the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName> to the item of $12,000 for Purdue
                University, submitted yesterday afternoon.</p>

              <p>Mr. JOHNSON deprecated the action of the faculty, but spoke in favor of extending
                to that Institution the fostering care of the State. The $12,000 appropriation
                proposed in the bill is inadequate ; it makes no provision for the running expenses,
                nor for the expenses of the chemical department. He moved to amend the
                  <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>'s amendment by increasing the appropriation
                from $12,000 to $20,000 and changing the proviso so as to require the faculty to
                rescind the rule. </p>

              <p>Mr. C<hi rend="sc">HAIRMAN</hi>-A great deal has been said on the floor of this
                Senate about a certain rule adopted in Purdue University and excluding the so-called
                Greek fraternities from that Institution. That such a rule was adopted and enforced
                no- body denies. The matter was carried before the Courts and even went to the
                Supreme Court for final adjudication, and after the decision of the Supreme Court it
                yet remains, go to say, in status quo, neither party being entirely satisfied with
                the decision. The result of this unfortunate quarrel is a great deal of bad blood
                and irritation, which certainly reacts upon the Institution itself. The Board of
                Trustees of Purdue, it is claimed, adopted the prescriptive rule against the Greek
                fraternities because it was afraid that the members of these fraternities would
                exert an injurious influence upon the spirit of an Institution which, to be true to
                the intentions of its organization, must forever remain an Academy for the benefit
                of agriculture and the mechanic arts. The Trustees supposed, it is claimed, that
                classical students, such as usually compose the fraternities, would look down with a
                sort of contempt on the students who were employed in the mechanical workshops and
                on the farm connected with the Institution, and m order to avoid the presumed danger
                of this contact, they excluded the fraternities from the Institution. Now, Mr
                Chairman, I am willing to believe that the Board of Trustees and the faculty were
                sincere and honest in their suppositions. But I must say at the same time that, in
                my opinion, they made a great, fatal mistake, and to a decree injured the
                Institution. I can not but believe that their fears and apprehensions concerning
                these fraternities are without solid foundation, and are based rather on imagination
                and illusion than on reality and substance. I will say right here that I want the
                management of this Institution to be broad and liberal. Purdue University is
                supported by National and State appropriations, and as such its portals should be
                thrown open wide to all applicants and to all new comers, no matter whether they are
                "Greeks" or barbarians, without any discriminations whatever as to religious,
                political or social connections. As soon as the faculty of any public institution,
                supported by the money of all the taxpayers of the State, makes such a
                discrimination, it will place itself in antagonism with one or more classes of
                citizens, and alienate their sympathies and good will. On that account I think the
                Board of Trustees in enacting the rule committed a grave error, and Purdue
                University has suffered by it. And, furthermore, Mr. Chairman, I do not see that
                these Greek fraternities do so much injury to their members. All over the State, in
                the highest offices and positions, we find men who have been or are still members of
                these fraternities. On the floor of this Senate they are largely represented, and if
                I am not mistaken a "Greek" occupies the presiding officer's chair with distinction
                and honor. Now this speaks well for these fraternities. I am not afraid of them! Let
                them come to Purdue and let them show there by their examplary conduct that the
                fears of these Trustees are groundless and unreasonable! Let them by a strict
                observance of the discipline of the University refute the charges preferred against
                them that they are unruly and would be detrimental to good order and peace! Let no
                rule or pledge stand in their way. Let this rule be rescinded, Mr. President, but
                let it b6 done in a decent and dignified manner. We represent here the sovereignty
                of a great State, and our acts should partake of the dignity which our exalted
                position confers upon us. If we deem it our duty, in the interest of Purdue
                University, to demand that the objectionable rule be rescinded, let us make that
                demand, but in doing so let us take care that we neither insult the men upon whom we
                enjoin the will of the State nor injure the Institution whose interests we are here
                to protect. I have not the least doubt that the Board of Trustees and the faculty of
                Purdue will bow to the sovereignty of the State as represented on this floor, and
                that they will rescind the rule if admonished to do so by this Senate. And although
                a Senator from Tippecanoe, which prizes Purdue University as one of her richest and
                most precious jewels, I Will say that a majority of my people will welcome the
                change in the management with pleasure and satisfaction. </p>

              <p>But now, Mr Chairman, let me also raise my voice in behalf of the noble
                Institution, which applies to this Senate for protection in Its growth and for
                support in the development of the ends for which it was created and organized.
                Purdue University is not classical Institution of learning, it is not a University
                proper. But with all respect and deference to those great classical Universities,
                which have done so much for mankind, and from which our entire civilization has
                sprung, I yet may justly claim that loan agricultural State like Indiana and to the
                citizens of this State, an Institution like Purdue is of much greater benefit and
                practical value than any University possibly can be. There we have an Institution
                founded for the cultivation of those special branches of education which are needed
                most right here in our State, in the States surrounding us, in the West. It is an
                Institution for the teaching of scientific and practical agriculture. It is located
                among us to give the sons of farmers, the sons of the people a valuable and
                practical education, which they can not otherwise acquire and without which most of
                the discoveries and conquests of modern science would be lost to them. In Purdue the
                young man who wishes to engage in agricultural pursuits in after life passes not
                only through a regular course of theoretical instruction in all those branches which
                are connected with and have a direct bearing on agriculture and horticulture,
                chemistry, botany, zoology, meteorology, entomology-but he has also an opportunity
                on the University farm to observe and study tho practical application of the lessons
                and instructions he has received in the school room. </p>

              <p>And again, the young student who devotes himself to the mechanical or Industrial
                arts, passes not only through a regular course of theoretical instruction in
                chemistry, drawing, engineering, mathematics, dynamics and natural philosophy but
                from the school room he passes into the laboratory and work shops and is initiated
                there at once into the practical application of the principles and lessons
                inculcated in the school room. Now, Mr. President, it is for this Institution, so
                invaluable to the industrial and farming interests of our State, that I ask adequate
                recognition and support at the hands of this Assembly. I want this Senate to make an
                appropriation for Purdue University which will prove sufficient to carry out the
                great project for which it was organized-to maintain in our midst an Institution for
                the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts." The Institution is there; it <pb
                  n="216" xml:id="VAA8558-21-215"/> is completely organized: it has a wide action of
                usefulness and influence, extending its sphere from year to year. It is located in
                one of the finest and wealthiest Counties of the State, in close proximity to one of
                the most beautiful and populous cities of the State, which has but lately added a
                valuable Public Library to its educational advantages; it is easy of access; it has
                beautiful buildings, a rich farm and all it needs in a liberal provision, both for
                its running expenditures and for such necessary improvements as will enhance its
                sphere of usefulness. The appropriation in the House bill, and retained in the
                amendment of the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>, is entirely inadequate to
                meet there demands. For the last four years, the running expenditures of Purdue
                University have averaged between $30,000 and $34,000, and it is thought impossible
                by the Board of Trustees that these expenditures can be reduced without crippling
                the Institution as a whole or crippling if not destroying its industrial
                departments. Three of these important departments-Experimental Agriculture and
                Horticulture, Practical Mechanics and Civil and Mechanical Engineering-have been
                organized during the last four years, and the proposed appropriation makes no
                provision at all for the running expenses of these important Departments, nor for
                the Department of Chemistry, including the State Chemist's work, which is connected
                with considerable expense and necessitates the employment of an Assistant Chemist.
                The $12,000 recommended by the Senate Committee are, as I sated before entirely
                insufficient, and should be increased to at least $20,000, both to meet the running
                expenses of those special Departments, which form, perhaps, the most valuable
                feature of the University, and also to add such apparatus, instruments, tools and
                improvements as are considered indispensable.</p>

              <p>I appeal to this Senate to vote that appropriation! It is necessary or I won Id not
                ask for it! Let it not be said that ill-advised considerations of economy caused us
                to cripple our Educational Institutions! This great State of which we have l so much
                cause to be proud, want is system of education to be equal or superior to the best
                in the land, and no man, no Senator, will find favor with his constituents who will
                weigh dollars and cents with too rigorous care where the most sacred educational
                interests of the State are involved. Not as a Senator from Tippecanoe County, not as
                a Senator protecting the local interests of his own immediate constituency, but as a
                member of the Senate of Indiana and in behalf of this noble State, in behalf of the
                industrial and agricultural interests of this State, Mr. President, I now move the
                following amendment to the amendment of the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> and
                hope that it will be adopted:</p>

              <p>Strike out [in line 138 of the printed bill] the word "twelve" and insert in lieu
                of it "twenty," and strike out all after the word "provide" and insert In lieu
                thereof the words; "That before any part of the appropriation hereby made be paid,
                the rule adopted by the Purdue University affecting secret societies, and the Greek
                fraternities in particular shall be rescinded." </p>

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM offered a substitute appropriating $20,000 for Purdue University, and
                spoke in favor of his proposition to increase the sum appropriated for Purdue
                University from $12,000 to $20,000, and in the course of his remarks said a great
                many are I led to believe the State has, financially speaking, a greater interest in
                Purdue University than the facts in the case will warrant. He had taken the pains to
                ascertain some facts on that subject, and finds that taking out of the account the
                amount donated by Mr. Purdue, Tippecanoe County, the city of Lafayette and the
                General Government, according to the financial valuation nut upon the Institution,
                its buildings, grounds, etc., the State of Indiana has invested in it the sum of
                $82,000. Now as 882 000 is to $650,000, so is the interest this General Assembly has
                in that Institution, and in that proportion and no greater has it the right to
                interfere with the local management of that Institution. He was not here to make a
                fight for the Greek fraternities or that University ; but let us not take as a fact
                a rumor started by some person who probably has evil designs upon that Institution.
                The Trustees say that interference at this time with the fraternity question will
                seriously embarrass the Institution. The President is possibly a member of a Greek
                fraternity, and if that be true, he knows both sides of the question, and with the
                Trustees knows better what is for the good of the classes of that University on that
                question than does this General Assembly.</p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY favored the proviso offered by the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Johnson].
                Not because not in favor of the proviso proposed by the <orgName>Finance
                  Committee</orgName>, but this one seems to be more satisfactory to the friends of
                the Institution. This is one of the great and growing Institutions of the State, and
                it is our duty to foster it in the broad and liberal way that tis character would
                indicate. He was not in favor of choking off appropriations for it, but on the
                contrary favored building it up.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN favored the proposed rider, provided it does not destroy the power of
                the Trustees and faculty to control the students in cases of personal misbehavior.
                Because the faculty have enacted a foolish rule which has brought disgrace upon the
                Institution, and is not manly enough to back down, this rider is the oil to be
                poured upon the troubled waters </p>

              <p>Mr VAN VORHIS also thought the rule referred to a very foolish one, and by this
                time the faculty must see they have made a mistake. He did not favor the rider
                proposed by the Committee, and did not think we can afford to add to the jury
                already done that Institution. He favored voting a sufficient sum to run the
                Institution, if it ought to have more than named in the bill; then the amendment
                increasing it to $20,000 ought to be adopted. </p>

              <p>Mr. HILLIGASS said the Senator from Hamilton [Mr. Graham] in the statement of
                donations to Purdue coming from other sources than the State, omitted to say that
                the State of Indiana has contributed in the past $266,000 for the support of that
                Institution. At one time it contained 284; students, but to day, in the face of an
                arbitrary rule adopted by the faculty, there are only 150 students From the showing
                in the past it may be predicted that the time is not far distant when Purdue
                University will have to be abolished altogether unless their tyrannical rules be
                abrogated. It the faculty have the right to go thus tar, they may go farther and
                prescribe rules against Church organizations. He spoke in favor of the amendment
                offered by the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Johnson.]</p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY opposed the proviso. If it is a proper regulation to be placed upon the
                statute books it ought to apply to all the Colleges in the State; but he favored the
                $20,000 appropriation. With the magnificent donation made by the grand old man whose
                name it bears, and with the donation made by the General Government fend from
                Tippecanoe County, and the aid it gets from the State, it ought to be the pride and
                glory of the State.</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN referred to the history of the establishment of Purdue University and
                the pledge by those then most interested in its location, that in the State would
                accept the offered gratuities and put this College upon its feet and employ the
                great power of the State to protect it, the Legislature would never be asked for a
                dollar to sup- port it. He hardly thought the people making that promise could keep
                it, and so staged at the time. However he has, and always shall, stand by and
                support any just and fair appropriation notwithstanding that promise. The rule
                adopted <pb n="217" xml:id="VAA8558-21-216"/> by the faculty he did not believe is
                right. It Is anti-American in principle. He favored the proviso as the only means by
                which the Legislative order can be made effective against the faculty order;
                although it does look a little like starving a fellow into obedience. He hoped this
                amendment would prevail, and if it were not adopted was almost persuaded to state he
                would not favor the appropriation of one dollar to the maintenance of the
                Institution. </p>

              <p>Mr. DAVIDSON felt a deep interest in the success of the Institution from the fact
                that the farm Ins interest is the grandest of all the interests in this great
                country-all other interests live by and are supported by he plow. Therefore if any
                Institution needs protection and sup- port from the State it is an Institution that
                will educate and instruct the rising generation how to plow and how to analyze the
                soils and thus make them more productive. He had farmed long enough to know that
                there is a great difference in the productions of soils, and a farmer requires a
                knowledge of what land needs or how land is to be treated in order to be more
                productive, and that knowledge can be obtained so well in no other way than by
                analyzing the soils, and a study of them so as to ascertain what they need in the
                way of fertilizing. He did not like the idea of putting a rider on this bill, but he
                wanted the Institution protected in such a way that the people of the State may
                derive the greatest benefit from its success in the interest of agriculture.</p>

              <p> Mr. BELL. [Mr. Spann in the Chair] was opposed to granting a single dollar of
                money to Purdue University, unless something in the nature of the provisions
                proposed by the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Johnson] is coupled with the donation
                when it is made. The rule adopted by the faculty is illiberal, unjust, unreasonable,
                and violates all principles which should control our actions, and unless some such
                proviso is adopted he would not vote aid to this Institution.</p>

              <p>Mr. MARVIN was in favor of voting $20,000 straight to Purdue University for the
                reason that it is the only farmers' College in the State of Indiana. Two years ago
                he favored $20,000, and it was voted without any restriction. What do you want to
                trammel Purdue for? It is wrong. He hoped the appropriation of $20,00 would be voted
                to Purdue University without a why or a wherefore.</p>

              <p> The substitute [Mr. Graham's] was rejected upon a division-affirmative, 14;

              <p>The last proposition of Mr. Johnson's amendment, that before any part of the
                appropriation be paid, any rule adopted by the faculty affecting secret societies
                and Greek fraternities in particular shall be rescinded, was agreed to.</p>

              <p> The first part of the amendment increasing the appropriation from $12,000 to
                $20,000, being next in order-</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN made an ineffectual motion to make the sum $15,000.</p>

              <p> Mr. MAGEE moved to make the appropriation $13,000.</p>

              <p> Mr. JOHNSON insisted the University needs from $20,000 to $25,000 to meet the
                current running expenses and necessary improvements. The Chemical Department alone
                requires $1,200, to say nothing of the other departments standing in need of
                improvements.</p>

              <p> Mr. KEISER opposed the motion unless it be the intention to cripple the University
                and eventually wipe it out. This is a people's College. There is not an Institution
                in the State whose <unclear reason="faded/missing">[?]ings</unclear> up will show so
                grand a result as this one. Others turn out lawyers, doctors and teachers, but this
                is the one poor man's College. </p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE, judging from the last exhibit, was sure <unclear reason="faded"
                  >$[?]3,000</unclear> was an ample sum to carry on that Institution. It cost nearly
                $15,000 to raise $2,000 worth of truck and vegetables, and nearly $4,000 each to
                educate a young man to become a farmer, and after being so educated he never becomes
                one. No Senator would vote a larger sum than be if needed.</p>

              <p>Mr. CAMPBELL presumed this Institution is under able management, and should be
                perpetuated. Then give it what is asked for by the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr.
                Johnson].</p>

              <p>The amendment [Mr. Magee's] was rejected, upon a division-affirmative, 13;
                negative, not announced. The amendment [Mr. Johnson's] for $20,000 was agreed to. </p>

              back from the <orgName>Committee on Railroads</orgName> without recommendation. [It
              provides that railroads shall fence within six months; furnish transportation on
              demand, except in certain contingencies, or be liable for loss occasioned thereby; no
              discrimination as to rebates or drawbacks; if unable to supply full demand for

            <p>On motion by Mr. PATTEN the Constitutional rules were suspended-yeas, 87; nays, 0-and
              the bill read the second time. </p>

            <p>Mr. Gilman did rot desire members to vote for this bill without first understanding
              its provisions. He simply desired that the amendments be adopted and the bill ordered
              printed. </p>

            <p>Mr. Gordon moved that the bill be printed and made the special order for next

            <p>Mr. GIBSON was opposed to making any more Special orders. He thought it would be a
              saving of time to allow all bills to come up in their regular order.</p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN considered this one of the most Important measures that could come before
              this General Assembly. While he had not asked a special order for any of his own
              bills, he believed that the people were demanding this legislation, and he was in
              favor of making this the special order for next, Tuesday. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY concurred in the remarks made by the gentleman from Clark [Mr. Gibson]. He
              thought there had been too many special orders.</p>

            <p>Mr. GORDON thought this question was second to none in importance that had come up
              before this House. He was, therefore, in favor of making it a special order.</p>

            <p> Mr. Stucker's bill [H. R. 261] to repeal Sections 4986 to 5,0l0 inclusive of the
              Revised Statutes of 1881, establishing a Stare Board of Health, was reported back from
              the <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName> with the recommendation that
              it be indefinitely postponed </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, thought the Board of Health an institution that ought not to
              be abolished. Every Nation in Europe that looks after the interests of its people
              sustain similar institutions. He was opposed to killing the matter without proper
              consideration. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN objected to Boards of Health because of the expense it had been to the
              people. He considered the $5,000 appropriated, but a small part of the cost of the
              people of the State. He moved to lay the report of the Committee on the table.</p>

            <p>The motion was rejected by yeas, 43; nays 49.</p>

            <p>Mr. Gilman's bill [H. R. 18] declaring it unlawful for Counties and Townships to aid
              in the construction of railroads, was reported back from the <orgName>Committee on
                Railroads</orgName> with th e recommendation that the emergency clause be stricken
              out.</p>

            <p> Mr. FRAZER moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed.</p>

            <p> Mr. GILMAN believed that the principle by which one man votes money out of the
              pocket of another is wrong. He was opposed to the motion to indefinitely postpone. </p>

            <p>Mr. ANTRIM thought it would be safe to allow the majority of the people to settle
              this matter. He referred to those Counties in the State that have but one railroad,
              and believed this bill would practically leave the Counties at the mercy of this one
              railroad, there being no competition. He thought that in such Counties the people
              should have the privilege of voting for another load if they so desire.</p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELY was of the opinion that the wisdom of the present law had never been
              questioned, and he hoped the present law would remain unchanged.</p>

            <p>Mr SMITH, of Tippecanoe, was of opinion that in some of the southern Counties of the
              State there was need of more railroads, and he was not in favor of denying them the
              privilege of voting for more railroads if they so desire. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY said: This is one of the bills formerly reported to this House by the
                <orgName>Railroad Committee</orgName> with instructions for indefinite postponement,
              and was by the House referred back to that Committee. After a second careful
              examination of all the provisions of the measure, it was unanimously ordered that the
              bill ought not to become a law. The Committee was unanimously of the of the opinion
              that the law ought to be left as it now is, and that people should be permitted to
              govern this matter in each Township as they think to their best interest.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, could not vote for the bill without having more facts
              concerning the case. He thought it might be possible that there are suits pending the

              this bill.</p>

            <p> Mr. SHAFFER made an explanation for the benefit of members. Mr. Heagey took
              possession of the office, and received a certificate of deposit from his predecessor
              for $20,000. In a few weeks the bank failed, and the money was lost without ever
              having been in the hands of Mr. Heagey, who has made good to the State all the School
              Fund, and has paid Madison County the sum of $6,000 of said amount. The amount yet due
              from him is the sum of $7,000. The Township Trustees have all been relieved by special
              acts of the Legislature. The citizens and taxpayers of the County are all asking that
              this bill pass for his relief.</p>

                reported that the Committee had up to the present time obtained $265, and desired to
                know what disposition the House desired them to make.</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. WILSON, of Marion, the Committee was directed to turn the amount
                over into the hands of the Board, consisting of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor,
                Secretary and Auditor of State. </p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT made an ineffectual motion to put the money In the hands of some of the
                Relief Societies of Indianapolis, saying he desired to place the money in the hands
                of parties who would give relief at once to those who are suffering.</p>

              <p>[It was ordered that when the House adjourn this afternoon it be until 2 o'clock on
                Monday.</p>

              <p> Mr. Jewett, from the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, reported back
                the bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_419">H. R. 419</ref>] to appropriate $100,000
                for the relief of the sufferers from the Ohio, Wabash and White River flood, without
                any recommendation. </p>

              <p> Mr. JEWETT spoke of the necessity of passing the bill while the members are all
                present, believing it would be undue delay to wait until the members were called
                together again next Monday at 2 o'clock.</p>

              <p> Mr. SHIVELY offered an amendment, which was accepted by Mr. Jewett, that any part
                of the appropriation not expended should be covered into the Treasury of the
                State.</p>

              <p> Mr. JEWETT moved that the bill be considered engrossed, read the third time by
                sections and put upon its passage.</p>

              <p> Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, was of the opinion that the House should not take this
                action at this time. If when members return next Monday it is found that this amount
                is necessary, then the House could pass the bill in five minutes and get it into the
                Senate at once.</p>

              <p> Mr. GIBSON had one reason why he desired the measure to pass at once. He believed
                that the reason the Board had been so slow in giving out the sum formerly
                appropriated was the small amount that they had to appropriate. That it required
                them to proceed in a too cautious manner. He hoped that the bill would pass the
                House this evening.</p>

              <p> Mr. PATTEN was not in favor of voting any further appropriation until the $40,000
                had been expended and it was seen to be necessary to pass this bill. He did not
                think the House or the Senate would be slow to act when the necessity is seen to
                arrive.</p>

              <p> Mr. THOMAS would favor this appropriation when he thought it necessary tot do
                so.</p>

              <p> Mr. MONTGOMERY thought it would be unexpedient to vote $100,000 at present.</p>

              <p> Mr. WILEY was favorably disposed toward the bill. If the money is not expended and
                is more than is necessary, it will be covered into the Treasury.</p>

              <p> Mr. WILSON, of Kosciusko, though the resources of the State too great to be
                penurious about granting this appropriation. He was going to materialize his feeling
                for the sufferers by voting this bill.</p>

              <p> Mr. SHOCKNEY could see no reason why gentlemen opposed this bill, since all money
                not expended would return to the State. The $40,000 appropriated for the former bill
                would not be $1 for each sufferer. He thought there was no time to wait for a
                Committee to investigate.</p>

              <p> Mr. JEWETT hoped that he would not be accused of unduly pressing the passage of
                the bill. He was satisfied if members knew of the message he had received of the
                persons who had come from the flooded district to plead for assistance, they would
                not question the purity of his motives in making this earnest effort to secure aid
                at once.</p>

              <p> Mr. MOODY spoke favorably of placing the bill upon its passage at once.</p>

              <p> Mr. WILSON, of Marion, thought in the face of the fact that more rain would likely
                fall in the near future, followed by colder weather, that this measure for relief
                should be acted upon at once.</p>

              <p> Mr. GORDON was of the opinion that if the House passed the bill leaving hte
                appropriation at $100,000 it would not pass the Senate. He made an ineffectual
                motion to reduce the appropriation to $60,000.</p>

              <p> The bill was considered engrossed and passed the House by yeas, 60; nays, <unclear
                  reason="faded">3[?]</unclear>.</p>

              <p> Mr. JEWETT moved to reconsider the vote and lay that motion on the table. The
                latter motion was agreed to. </p>

                    <salute>Gentlemen of the Senate:</salute>

                  <p>The Constitution provides that every bill which shall have passed the General
                    Assembly shall be presented to the Governor, and that if he approve he shall
                    sign it, but if not he shall return it with his objections to the House in which
                    it shall have originated. It further provides that if any bill shall not be
                    returned by the Governor within three days (Sunday excepted) after it shall have
                    been presented to him it shall be a law without his signature unless the general
                    adjournment shall prevent its return.</p>

                  <p> Senate Bill No. 1 relating to the government and management of the Benevolent
                    Institutions, was presented to me on Wednesday, the 14th inst., Saturday, the
                    17th inst., had the Senate been in session, was the last day upon which I could
                    have returned the bill with objections. The Senate not having been in session
                    that day, and yesterday having been Sunday, no doubt is entertained that it is
                    competent for me to return the bill with my last objections to-day. On Saturday
                    last, however, thinking that a question might possibly be started whether, in
                    order that the objections might be in session, the bill should not have been
                    delivered to the presiding officer of the Senate on that day along with my
                    objections thereto, I placed the bill in his hands and a written statement of my
                    objections to it, and requested him to return the bill to the Senate on the
                    meeting of the Senate to-day, and also to cause to be communicated to the Senate
                    the statement of objections which I delivered to him. I have the honor now to
                    repeat the same request, regretting however that an occasion has arisen which
                    obliges me, under a sense of official duty, to differ from a majority of the two
                    Houses in relation to the expediency of the passage of the bill. </p>

                    <salute> Gentlemen of the Senate:</salute>
                  </opener>

                  <p>I respectfully return to the Senate, with my objections, Senate Bill No. 1,
                    entitled, "An act providing for the better government and management of the
                    Hospital for the Insane, the Asylum for the Blind, and the Institution for the
                    Deaf and Dumb; repealing all laws or parts of laws in conflict therewith, and
                    declaring an emergency." The power of the Governor to appoint Trustees for the
                    three Benevolent Institutions, the Hospital for the Insane, the Institution for
                    the Education of the Blind, and the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, was
                    conferred by the act of March 6, 1879, reorganizing these institutions. But one
                    Legislature has intervened since the passage of the act. The Legislature that
                    passed it deemed the necessity so strong for the provision transferring from
                    itself to the Executive the power of appointing Trustees that it did not allow
                    the President of the Board of Trustees and two other Trustees whose terms of
                    office had then two years to run, to serve out any part of the residue of their
                    terms. The reasons of the Legislature for desiring to transfer this power from
                    itself to the Governor are not difficult to understand. The sessions of the
                    Legislature are limited by the Constitution to sixty days, except when some
                    extraordinary duty is devolved upon it, such as revising the whole body of our
                    laws.</p>

                  <p>The time is sufficient when the Legislature is in a condition to address itself
                    with earnestness to its legislative work. But to perform the duties entrusted to
                    it within the time limited, and to form wise laws, the uninterrupted and
                    deliberate attention of members of the Legislature is of course imperatively
                    necessary. That attention can not be given when the Legislature converts itself
                    into a body for the distribution of officers, and time is necessarily consumed
                    every day in the bodies of the Houses and elsewhere in listening to the
                    solicitations of candidates and their friends. The inevitable effect is a
                    distraction from the duties incumbent upon themselves and a <pb n="221"
                      xml:id="VAA8558-21-220"/> great waste of time. It is also well-known that when
                    the Legislature makes itself a direct agency for bestowing office, party spirit
                    always runs so high that the greater portion of its time is spent in useless
                    political controversies, to the great detriment of the business which its
                    members were elected to discharge. </p>

                  <p>These may well be supposed to have been the considerations which induced the
                    Legislature in 1879 to change the law to what it is now. The chief complaint of
                    the people against our laws is that they are so unstable. The people do not see
                    why the laws abolished and changed so often that plain men can never be certain
                    what the laws are, and are obliged to resort, to a professional class to learn
                    what they are, on the simplest subjects. It Is a wise rule not to change a law
                    until evil consequences from it are sensibly felt. </p>

                  <p>It is claimed by the friends of the bill now re turned, that the present law
                    which it is intended to replace, has thus far worked well. If, under it the
                    Governor nominates for Trustees persons unsatisfactory to the Senate, that body
                    can refuse to confirm the nominations, and put upon him the responsibility of
                    nominating others whom they may ultimately approve. If he omits to do so the
                    incumbents will continue to hold their places. The people will therefore
                    perceive no satisfactory reason why in four years after passage of the present
                    law it should be repealed by the law which the Legislature in 1879 condemned. </p>

                  <p>The power of appointing to office is not one to be coveted by the executive. To
                    a sensitive mind the disappointment inflicted upon many worthy applicants is
                    more keenly felt than the gratification of giving to a successful few. In
                    arguing in favor of the law as it now is I feel that I can speak therefore, in
                    an impersonal way for what is best for the public and not for what would be most
                    agreeable to the appointing officer. </p>

            <head rend="center">GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>

            <p> The Lieutenant Governor announced the special order being the consideration of the
              general appropriation bill [H. R. 302], as in <orgName>Committee of the
                Whole</orgName> [Mr. Bell in the Chair] commencing where the Committee left off on
              Friday afternoon.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE moved to make office expenses of the Clerk of the Supreme Court $500.</p>

            <p> It was agreed to.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY moved to increase the appropriation for the Fishery Commission from $1,000
              to $3,000. He has information that the present Fish Commissioner spent more during the
              past year than the appropriation. If we are to have this most benevolent institution
              of the States it ought to be placed on a basis that will enable the Fish Commissioner
              to carry out the purposes and intention of the law. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD opposed the increase, especially when not more than $1,300 was asked.</p>

            <p>Mr. WHITE favored the motion. The northern part of the State is dotted all over with
              lakes, which should be stocked with fish. The State of Michigan appropriates s^me
              $10,000 a year, and Indiana should not be so far behind. </p>

            <p>Mr. YOUCHE heartily concurred with the remarks just made by the Senator from Elkhart
              [Mr. White]. There is nothing that adds so much to the comfort, happiness and pleasure
              of the people of his section as good fishing grounds. They all are in favor of it, and
              they all want the Fishing Commission to be encouraged. </p>

            <p>Mr. FAULKNER opposed the motion. Fish can be obtained by anyone by sending for them,
              without money and without price, a large sum being yearly expended by the government
              for the propagation of fish, which will be distributed to proper applicants.</p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN insisted Indiana ought not to be niggardly in this matter of placing in the
              streams of this State food fishes, so that fishing may be full and free to every man
              who will cast a line. Indiana should be put in a position in this matter to be abreast
              of sister States on this fish question.</p>

            <p> The amendment [Mr. Bundy's] was agreed to upon a division-affirmative, 23; negative
              not counted.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE moved to increase the sum appropriated for maintenance of T( pairs of the
              State's Prison North from $75,000 to $85,000, at the suggestion of the Chairman of the
                <orgName>Committee on Prisons</orgName>.</p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL visited the Prison with the Committee and knew the boilers were old and
              dangerous, and provision should be made for insane convicts. which latter are simply
              inhuman.</p>

            <p>The amendment was agreed to. </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN made the same motion with regard to the State Prison South. Before that
              Prison can be put in proper condition it needs a new wall better cell facilities, etc. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD thought it a strange way to treat an appropriation bill, when nothing of
              the kind is asked by the management. Last year both of these Prisons were within
              $75,000 of two years ago. It is the business of those interested to make these kind of
              demands, and he objected to these increases.</p>

            <p> Mr. BENZ said the Warden of the Northern Prison requested him to make an increase,
              and would have been here but for sickness, asking that an additional amount be
              appropriated. </p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN said the Warden of the Southern Prison made a similar statement. The work
              house needs repair, the cells need repairs and the Prison generally put in better
              condition.</p>

            <p> The amendment was agreed to upon admission-affirmative, 23; negative, not
              announced.</p>

            <p> The <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>'s amendment reducing the appropriation for
              the Female Reformatory from $30,000 to $28,000, being read- </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD said the appropriation for this Institution has not been expended but
              once.</p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS insisted instead of lowering this appropriation it ought to be
              increased. He moved to insert $35,000 instead of $30,000.</p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN hoped the sum in the bill would be allowed to remain. The managers tell
              him, as a member of the Committee, that they never had enough money appropriated for
              its management.</p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM desired to see the substitute amendment prevail. He visited this
              Institution two years ago with the Committee, and if the inmates are fed as they were
              on that occasion, it is a disgrace to the State of Indiana-the food was unfit for any
              human being to eat He hoped the management would see 10 it that no starvation is
              Bilowed in that Institution.</p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS understands that two years ago there was over $2,000 unexpended; and
              that this is not the way to avert the evils just complained of. Unless this is done he
              opposed increasing the appropriation. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN contended this sum can be used for maintenance-including food and clothing
              and repairs. This bill makes an increase of $2,000 over last, year, and that is
              probably as far as should be gone. He hoped the officers would remedy the evil spoken
              of by the Senator from Hamilton [Mr. Graham.] </p>

            <pb n="222" xml:id="VAA8558-21-221"/>

            <p> Mr. WHITE thought the appropriation ought to be increased.</p>

            <p> Mr. CAMPBELL in conversation with the Governor, that gentleman stated the
              appropriation has been too small.</p>

            <p> Mr. RISTINE stated that there was urgent need in preparing comfortable quarters for
              the sick.</p>

            <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS was satisfied $35,000 is none too much. That Institution is in such a
              needy condition the State ought not to permit it to remain. Many things have been left

            <p> The motion was rejected by yeas, 13; nays, 24.</p>

            <p> Mr. McINTOSH also explained his negative vote. When the bill appropriating $40,000

              considering the vast amount proposed to be appropriated by this bill, it ought not to

            <p>Mr. HOWLAND desired that the report would not be concurred in. If it was the sense of
              the Committee he would not object to striking out that provision of the bill which
              provided for an appropriation by the State to pay for the publication of reports of
              these several Societies. He thought that these Societies are composed of the
              industrious and representative men of almost <pb n="224" xml:id="VAA8558-21-223"/>
              every County in the State. They meet in Indianapolis every year to hold their annual
              meetings. They ask this appropriation for the purpose of publishing their reports that
              the farmers all over the State may have the benefit of their reports and statistics. </p>

            <p>Mr. MUTZ could see no necessity for this bill at the present time. He had no
              objections to these Societies, but he did not think they should ask the State to pay
              their expenses. </p>

            <p>Mr. OILMAN favored the report of the Committee to indefinitely postpone. He was of
              the opinion that the^e same reports were to be found in the reports of the State Board
              of Agriculture. He was not in favor of taxing the whole people to pay the expense of
              Associations composed of a few persons. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, was in favor of doing every thing possible to encourage the
              agricultural, mechanical and other Associations of 'the State. He favored the
              suggestion of the gentleman from Marion [Mr. Howland] to press the bill, if necessary,
              without the appropriation. </p>

            <p> Mr. DEEM was astonished at the report of the Committee. He was satisfied that the
              Committee labored under a misapprehension concerning the provision of the measure. It
              is a bill to encourage stock raising, wool growing and cane growing, etc. The
              appropriation asked is to publish these reports that they may be scattered among the
              farmers of the State. The reports are not introduced simply for the breeders and stock
              men, but they are for all farmers.</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. DEEM the report of the Committee was laid on the table and the bill

            <head rend="center">PUBLICATION OF INSURANCE STATEMENTS.</head>

            <p> Mr. Heffren's bill [H. R. 251] to amend Section 1 of an act in regard to foreign
              Insurance Companies.</p>

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN hoped that the report of the Committee to indefinitely postpone would
              not be concurred in. He could not see any reason, and did not think any member could
              see any good reason why two papers in the city of Indianapolis should have exclusive
              right to publish these statements. Not one-tenth of the voters of the State take these
              Indianapolis papers. He was in favor of having these statements published in the
              papers of the different Counties of the State wherever these Companies have
              established agencies.</p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, was in favor of good Insurance Companies, and very much
              opposed to poor Insurance Companies. He desired to be fair to the Companies as well as
              to the people, and he thought this bill would require the Companies to publish
              statements in ninety-two Counties, which he thought would be somewhat of a
              hardship.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, desired to say in behalf of the Committee that this report
              reflected the sentiment of each individual member of the Committee. After a careful
              consideration of the question the Committee decided that the beat thing to do was to
              leave this law as it is now. The present law has given substantial satisfaction to the
              Companies, and substantial satisfaction to the State officers. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT moved that the bill be recommitted to the <orgName>Committee on
                Insurance</orgName>, with instruction that the bill be amended so as to require
              Insurance Companies to publish these statements in the papers of the several Counties
              in which said Companies were doing business. The motion was agreed to. </p>

            <p>Mr. Montgomery's bill [H. R. 246] to compel Foreign Insurance Companies doing
              business in this. State to pay judgments rendered against them in one year from the
              time the judgment was rendered, unless an appeal is taken, was recommended to be
              indefinitely postponed.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. MONTGOMERY, the report of the Committee to indefinitely postpone was
              laid on the table, and the bill was ordered engrossed.</p>

          <p> On motion by Mr. YANCEY the reading of the Secretary's minutes of yesterday's

          <p>The bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_066">H. R. 66</ref>] to legalize the

            <head rend="center">FLOOD SUFFERS.</head>

            <p> Mr. SPANN moved that the Constitutional rule be dispensed with in order that the
              bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_419">H. R. 419</ref>] to appropriate $100,000 for
              the relief of sufferers by the floods on the Ohio, Wabash and White Rivers may be read
              the first time by sections, the second time by title, the third time by sections and
              put on its passage. </p>

            <p>The motion was rejected by yeas, 20; nays, '&lt;;3. Pending the roll call-</p>

            <p>Mr. DUNCAN, when his name was called, said he had just returned from Jeffersonville,
              New Albany, Madison, Aurora and Lawrenceburg, but as the other members of the
              Committee had not returned, he thought it but just they have time to report to the
              Senate that it may vote intelligently on this subject. There is yet unexpended $25,000
              of the $40,000 appropriated, and it will take some time to use that up. So he voted
              "no." </p>

            <p>Mr. HOWARD, in explanation of his vote said because of the misery he knew was
              existing among these sufferers, and $40,000 is insufficient to relieve the distress,
              voted "aye.'</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES when his name was called, said: When I know that the people are in
              distress owing to the great disaster brought upon them by unexpected floods, and when
              I know I have a right to do any act for their relief, I am willing to do it promptly,
              without luggling over forms and questionable delay. I vote "aye." </p>

            <p>So the rules were not suspended. </p>

            <p>By consent the bill was read the first time and referred to the <orgName>Committee on

            <head rend="center">STOCK RUNNING AT LARGE.</head>

            <p>Mr. ADKISON called up his notice given Friday to reconsider the vote by which Mr.
              Yancey's bill [S. 62] was rejected to prevent the running at large of stock, was
              rejected. </p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY Insisted if there ever was a time- when such a bill should be passed it is
              now when so many fences have been swept away by the recent floods The present law has
              been found wholly insufficient. The running at large of stock ought not to be
              allowed.</p>

            <p>Mr. LOCKRIDGE also hoped the bin will pass. There never was a time when such
              legislation 1s- more needed than the present. Being at home over Sunday the people
              with whom he talked: were universally demanding such a measure. In many cases no
              fences have been left and there not sufficient timber to replace them. The statistics
              of 1880 show the fencing in. Indiana alone would reach fourteen and one-half times
              around the world, and the rail fence in Allen County would reach nine times around the
              State. The value of stock in this State is $104,658 260, or over $l2,000,000 less than
              the estimated value of fencing. This will be a big question in the near future: if
              about one-fourth or one eighth the amount of fencing will keep stock up.</p>

            <p> Mr. MAY trusted the bill would not pass It is not consistent in Senators to vote for
              $100,000 to be given to sufferers in the Southern part of the State one minute and
              then vote for the passage of this bill the next. Simply say to the people along the
              Ohio River, "you shall fence in your stock," thus making a pasture monopoly for land
              owners and consign poor people to suffer by taking from them the main stay of their
              subsistance-their cows. He remonstrated against the passage of this bill, especially
              at this time. </p>

            <p>Mr. DAVIDSON said if this bill does not consume a good deal of time it is worthy of
              careful consideration. He opposed any measure that has a tendency to make neighbors
              fallout with each other and quarrel, and that is what the present <pb n="226"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-225"/> law for enclosing stock does whenever it is enforced. He
              would prefer to furnish pasture for the poor man who works for him, than to keep all
              his land fenced in. Then when cows are kept in pasture the owner can find them,
              otherwise they stray off four or five miles, and will not give as good milk or as much
              of it as if they had a pasture to run in. He favored the passage of this bill.</p>

            <p>Mr. ADKISON explained he made the motion to reconsider at the request of the author
              of the bill, and having voted against it twice before would do so again.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES insisted this bill would work a hardship in some portions of the State.
              The present law on this subject is right-it is in effect to make a local option on
              this subject. A petition to the Commissioners will certainly reflect the will of the
              people in the locality, and the County Commissioners will undoubtedly reflect that
              will. </p>

            <p>The bill failed to pass by yeas, 21; nays. 22. </p>

            <head rend="center">AN ADDITIONAL INSANE ASYLUM.</head>

            <p>On motion by Mr. BUNDY the Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special
              order, being Mr. Rahm's bill [S. 87] for the location of a new Insane Asylum, and he
              moved to amend the report of the Committee which proposes to locate a second Asylum at
              Fort Wayne, by striking out the amendments recommended by the Committee so as to leave
              the bill as originally introduced. The cities of Elkhart, Richmond, Logansport, South
              Bend, and probably Peru, will or have made application; the necessity being so great
              for a location of at least one Asylum, in justice to the people of Evansville their
              bill should go through on its merits. After the location is made there a bill for a
              location north can be introduced.</p>

            <p> Mr. FOULKE offered a substitute for the amendment to the report of the Committee so
              as to provide for three new Insane Asylums, to be located at Evansville, Richmond and
              Logansport. He declared the first duty of the State is to make adequate provision for
              the insane-and it ought to be immediate. The uniform result has been shown to be
              better for these helpless beings where they are not brought together in large
              numbers-300 or 400 at most are as large a number as should be put in one Asylum. We
              should provide for the accommodation of at least 1,000 more patients in Insane
              Asylums. He would guarantee them proper treatment as well at Richmond as at any point
              in the State. It is, among cities corresponding in size, the third in raying the least
              death rate among all others in the United States. It is wise policy to scatter the
              State institutions somewhat. Richmond has never yet been favored in this way, and is
              now willing, by its City Council, to appropriate $25,000 to secure the location of one
              of these Asylums there. </p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL offered a substitute providing for a Commission to consist of the
              Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary and Auditor of State and Superintendent of
              the Insane Asylum to select a location for each of the Asylums, and that the bill be
              referred to a Special Committee to so amend the bill as proposed. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES favored this substitute as the only way to harmonize this matter. It is an
              easy way to get out of a dilemma; and a Commission may be better able to make a proper
              election than the General Assembly. He hoped the Senate will send this bill to a
              Special Committee with instructions similar to that last proposed. </p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS also favored the proposition of the Senator from St. Joseph [Mr.
              Campbell], venturing the assertion there were not less than 100 lobbies seeking the
              location of these Asylums. He opposed entertaining any pecuniary proposition from any
              locality for the location of such Asylums. They ought to be spurned and locations made
              where easy of access and for the health and comfort of these unfortunate people. He
              was unwilling to favor any but the cottage system. Those bereft of reason should have
              plenty of daylight, fresh air and sunshine.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL, fearing the building of any Asylum would be endangered, which would be a
              public calamity, moved to refer the bill to a Special Committee, to report at 2
              o'clock, said Committee to consist of Senators Voyles, Campbell, Magee, Rahm, White,
              Foulke and Bell. </p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN has been importuned by his constituents to put in a claim for one of the
              cities he represents as a location for one of these Asylums, but at the risk of
              displeasing them he would not endanger the passage of this bill by doing so, although
              his city is unsurpassed in many advantages by any other location named. This bill had
              better be passed than to get in a quarrel over locations. Let not this enterprise be
              imperiled by the tacking onto it a location for any other place, but stand by the
              original proposition to build one at Evansville.</p>

            <p> Mr. MAGEE stated that in sixty days the building at Logansport can be ready for the
              reception of 300 patients, and if a speedy accommodation of these unfortunates be
              indeed desired, the Logansport proposition should be accepted at once.</p>

            <p> Mr. WHITE opposed the substitute by the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke] because in
              the northern part of the State there are several cities combining all the advantages
              of Richmond. No city in the Union, for healthfulness, excels the city of Elkhart. And
              as far as brick are concerned, no city can furnish as cheap and as good a quality.
              Then Elkhart will subscribe any reasonable sum of money to secure the location. The
              northern part of the State is entitled to a State building, and he pressed the claim
              of the city of Elkhart, which will do as much or more than any city of its size in the
              State. </p>

            <p> Mr. RISTINE referred to a bill providing for Commissioners to be appointed by the
              Governor to locate a place in the northern and in the southern part of the State which
              claims his preference, but he was willing to favor the motion to refer to the Select
              Committee proposed by the Senator from Allen and Whitley [Mr. Bell.] </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL feared if this discussion is kept up no location will be made this session.
              He favored his motion for the consideration of the bill by the Select Committee named
              in his motion. He believed the Committee could agree on a location in the northern
              part of the State.</p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY favored passing the original bill as introduced. He opposed the tacking on
              a good bill something not conceded by all as a good measure. He favored making ample
              provision for the afflicted of the State.</p>

            <p>Mr. ADKISON repelled the assumption that there are few who will vote again t a
              location at Evansville, and believed the first consideration should be as to the
              health of the location, the second drainage, and the third facilities for reaching the
              place. He favored an untrammelled Commission to select the location. Peru is the most
              central point in Northern Indiana, yet no body there seeking the location there. It
              immediate provision for the insane is desired Logansport is ahead of any other
              location. He opposed the appointment of a Commission. </p>

            <pb n="227" xml:id="VAA8558-21-226"/>

            <p>Mr. WILLARD finds this Senate is but repeating the history often years ago. In 1872
              there as introduced a bill for the erection of a Hospital for the incurably insane,
              which failed to puss after a 100 days session. In the closing days of this session we
              find ourselves in a similar position. It we are to give relief to a class which has
              suffered more and suffered longer that any other, we should strip the bill of all but
              the provisions embraced in it when originally introduced. Only eight or nine days of
              the working days of this session are left and it should be passed at once. The
              greatest demand of the State is for the building of an Asylum at once. </p>

            <p>Mr FOULKE said that is the very reason he favored the reference of this bill to the
              Select Committee representing these different interests. He believed such action would
              facilitate the passage of the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to add to the motion [Mr. Bell's] that Evansville be selected by said
              Committee as one of the locations. </p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE believed the sense of the General Assembly that two Insane Asylums shall be
              built. If the Senate will vote for Evansville simply because a lobby has been here
              from the beginning of the session urging her claims, he objected. He favored the
              motion without the addition. </p>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON, for the Select Committee on Prison Labor, submitted a report (which was,
              without being read, ordered printed), accompanied by a bill [S. 284] to abolish
              contracts for convict labor, and regulating the employment of convicts of our State
              Prisons and Reformatory Schools. The bill was read the first time. He made an
              ineffectual motion-yeas, 22, nays, 21-that the bill be made a special order for Friday
              at 2 o'clock. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES, as a privileged question, called up his motion, notice of which was
                given yesterday, to change the rule 54 so that the daily order of business shall be

              <p> Mr. SPANN raised the point of order that this question can not be called up as a
                privileged question.</p>

              <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR believed that such a motion can be called up at any
                time.</p>

              <p> By consent the Senate returned to the consideration of the subjection pending at
                the noon recess. </p>

              <head rend="center">NEW INSANE ASYLUM.</head>

              <p>Mr. Brown withdrew his amendment pending at the noon recess.</p>

              <p> Mr. BUNDY moved to refer the bill to a Special Committee of Six to be appointed by
                the Chair, with instructions to selection Evansville as one of the points, and that
                the Committee amend the bill so as to provide for an additional Asylum, the location
                to be left blank.</p>

              <p> Mr. GRAHAM questioned the advisability of the Legislature traveling around to hunt
                up a location for any public building. The arguments are all against a location at
                Evansville, and he opposed such a location. The bill allowed the transportation to
                Evansville from all parts of the State. That is away down in the pocket on the Ohio
                River, a distance of 182 from here, the center of the State, and 320 miles from the
                north-east corner of the State. The Committee suggested by the Senator from Allen
                and Whitley [Mr. Bell] is a proper one and he desired that Committee should be
                untrammeled by instructions. He hoped it would thoroughly canvass all the places
                mentioned in connection with a location for the new Asylums.</p>

              <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS also thought the Committee should not be instructed for
                Evansville-all locations should be considered together. He favored making provision
                now for the entire insane of the State. There is more interest manifested in
                securing locations than in the people who are to occupy the buildings when erected.
                The proposition of the Senator from St. Joseph [Mr. Campbell] is the wisest one yet
                advanced. He favored any number of Asylums required to take care of the insane of
                the State. It is well understood that it is not for the best interest of the insane
                people to mass them together-the literature on this question is full of good
                suggestions not mentioned in this discussion.</p>

              <p> He thought there should be four or six different locations, putting probably not
                more than $100,000 at each location. There is no question but that the cottage plan
                should be adopted. </p>

              <p> Mr. BUNDY withdrew his substitute, and offered in lieu an amendment, by providing
                that the Committee shall be appointed by the Chair. </p>

              <p>Mr. CAMPBELL opposed the motion to change the composition of the Committee-thinking
                it best to have a Committee of those whose localities desire the Asylums.</p>

              <p> Mr. RHAM objected from the start to any amendment to his bill. He replied to
                objections to locating the Asylum at Evansville, which lies on the Ohio River which
                skirts the borders of this State for some 350 miles, and a person can travel that
                entire distance on one of the Ohio River floating palaces for the sum of $5.
                Vanderburg County has formed no combination in this matter. He desired the Northern
                portion of the State compromise the differences. He introduced his bill the 12th of
                January and no other city in the Southern part of the State has applied for the
                location. Provisions and living are cheaper there than elsewhere in the State; for
                instance, coal is delivered for 90 cents a ton.</p>

              <p> Mr. MARVIN did not like to see so little attention paid to the Committee report.
                He thought the General Assembly should select the location, and not trust that duty
                to a rambling Commission. These Asylums should be built immediately. Evansville is
                the next largest city in the State and Ft. Wayne comes next to Evansville, and he
                thought it to be to the interest of the State to locate these Institutions near the
                large cities.</p>

              <p> Mr. FLETCHER took himself somewhat the credit of suggesting to the Senate
                Committee the idea of building Asylums throughout the State instead of massing the
                insane in one Institution as in Indianapolis-making a mass of insane humanity more
                calculated to breed insanity than to cure it. The sentiment of Superintendents of
                Insane Asylums throughout Europe is against the American plan, which is continued
                through the influence of the Superintendents who are personally interested in
                keeping the Asylums very large. We need a great deal of laid and a great many
                smaller Asylums-not gaudy with outside decorations and whited sepulchres within.
                Many of them he feared would be found very black. It is a shame to take insane
                persons from their families a long distance, and is more calculated to create
                permanent insanity than to bring relief. He favored the establishment of Asylums
                near the large centers of population, which shall have the appearance and comforts
                of homes. The things constantly going on within the wall of large Institutions no
                one man can possibly know. No doubt there are men confined in such Insane Asylums
                who are as sane as any man on this floor. Small Asylums will prove far more
                efficacious in preventing persons from being sent to these Asylums who are not
                insane. He opposed the motion for a Commission to locate these Asylums, but hoped
                this General Assembly as in duty bound, would carry the plan out of building
                many-seven or eight or ten if necessary-commencing at Evansville next Fort Wayne, as
                being accessable places and the centers of population. </p>

              <body>
                <div type="resolution">
                  <p>Whereas, The plan of the State id letting convict labor at low rates has effect
                    to decrease the wages of honest labor, and consequently diminishes the ability
                    to educate their children and provide for those depending upon them; and, </p>

                  <p>Whereas. The present system of employing convict labor comes in conflict with
                    the rights and interest of honest citizens who have devoted years of toil to
                    become skilled workmen, and thus enable them to add to the revenue and welfare
                    of thin State therefore</p>

                  <p>Resolved, That we regard the letting of convict labor at too low rates not only
                    a great personal injustice to honest labor but a damage to the best interest of
                    the State, and consequently should be discontinued; and,</p>

                  <p>Resolved. That a Special Committee of Five be appointed to whom the subj ct
                    shall be referred with instructions to suggest some remedy for the present

              <head rend="center">THE STATE UNIVERSITY.</head>

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM called for the special order, being his bill [<ref
                  target="#HB_1883_01_04_256">H. R. 256</ref>] to provide a fund for the permanent
                endowment of the State University, and it was read the third time.</p>

              <p>Mr. GILMAN hoped the bill would not pass the House. He was not in favor of taking
                the people of the whole State to endow an Institution that does not benefit more
                than 30 per cent of the people of the Stale. </p>

              <p>Mr. GORDON said: Before the members vote upon this it would be proper to pause a
                moment and consider the magnitude of this question. This bill ought not to pass, for
                it is not in the interest of the general educational interests of the State. An
                appropriation of $90,000 annually for twelve years would be equivalent to taking a
                fund that would run the Common Schools of the State for three months. It is wrong in
                principle to appropriate this money. It is not for the benefit of the people of the
                entire State, and his tax should not be collected from the people of the whole
                State. </p>

              <p>Mr. Wilson, of Kosciusko, hoped this bill will not pass, and in opposing it trusted
                no one will change him with not having proper respect for our educational interests,
                the provision of this bill for the endowment of this University are not such as he
                could support. There are thousands of people all over this State who are in debt for
                their homes and it would not be good financiering for us to attempt to raise this
                appropriation by taxing these people, who are already paying from 6 to 8 per cent.
                on their indebtedness. </p>

              <p>Mr. MONTGOMERY hoped this bill will pass. As has been stated, her education
                interests are the pride of the State of Indiana. It would be prudent for us to vote
                this money for the permanent endowment of this Institution. One per cent on the $100
                is a very small tax, and it would be expedient for us as the Legislature assembled
                here to vote this appropriation, that this Institution may be made a permanent
                Institution. </p>

              <p>Mr. McMULLEN did not desire to detain the House long, but it appeared to him that
                this bill should pass. He thought no member would say that Indiana ought not to have
                a permanent University, one that will be the pride of the State. We must do as other
                States have done. We must profit by their example. He desired to tale to the
                gentleman from Putnam [Mr Gordon] that the tax for the coming year is not to be
                increased one cent by the provisions of this bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. STUCKER opposed the passage of the bill.</p>

              <p>Mr. MELLETT said: I am in favor of the passage of this bill. I can say for one that
                when I believes a measure is right, and that it is just, and that it is for the best
                interest of the State, that I can not refuse to support it, because I must meet my
                constituents hereafter. I believe that this measure is in the best interests and
                welfare of the State, and for this reason I am in favor of it. I think the time has
                come when the people of this State should be willing to endow this Institution. </p>

              <p>Mr. K ESTER thought that if it is right to maintain this Institution it should be
                done in a credit table manner. He did not apprehend that this bill would cripple or
                influence the Common School Interests of the State in the least. He hoped that the
                bill would pass. </p>

              <p>Mr MOODY spoke in favor of the bill.</p>

            Commissioners was read the second time, and with an amendment by Mr. Voyles requiring
            the Commissioners to be selected one from each Supreme Court Judicial District, the bill
            was considered as engrossed, and under a dispensation of the Constitutional restriction

            <head rend="center">NEW INSANE ASYLUM </head>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES, from a majority of the Special Committee thereon, returned the bill fs
              87] for the location of a new Insane Asylumn at Evansville, Vandergurg County,
              recommending the substitution of new matter, authorizing the Governor to appoint two
              Commissioners from each of the two political parties, who, with the Governor, shall
              select suitable sites over fifty miles from Indianapolis for three new Insane
              Hospitals on not exceeding 160 acres of land, Commissioners to be allowed $5 per day
              and expenses; $300,000 appropriated for 1883 and the same amount for 1884. The Board
              to appoint Superintendents of builings and also Superintendents of the Hospitals. No
              patient to be discharged until permanently cured. The capacity of each to be from 200
              to 700 patients. </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL, for the minority of the same Committee, recommended the passage of the bill
              reported by the majority, with the provision that one of the Asylums shall be located
              at Evansville signed by himself and Mr. Rahm.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES opposed naming any place for a location, as is proposed by the minority,
              and favored leaving this question in the hands of the Commissioners.</p>

            <p>Mr. YANCEY believed, in justice to all concerned, that the minority report should
              prevail, inasmuch as the citizens of Evansville seem to have taken more kindly to the
              proposition for establishing another Insane Hospital than any other city in the State.
              Though it be in the pocket, that city should have justice dealt out to it.</p>

            <p>Mr. ADKISON opposed the minority report, and saw nothing in the argument just
              advanced. That city may be more enterprising than many others, but he denied it had
              more interest in the unfortunates of the State than many other places, mentioned or
              not mentioned. It can afford to enter into with other places desiring the location of
              this Institution.</p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS regretted feeling compelled to vote against the minority report-thus
              encumbering the bill with the selection of one location which would be unwise. If one
              is to be selected, all should; if only one, then none should be. </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL conceded some force in the last remarks, and yet the minority report
              commends itself above such reasoning. In the discussion yesterday there was a decided
              feeling expressed in favor of locating one of these Asylums at Evansville, and that
              being a large center of population, easily and cheaply accessible, with other
              considerations, influenced the minority to bring in its report. There seems to be an
              agreement upon Evansville all over the southern part of the State. While there are so
              many cities in the northern part of the State seeking the location it is better to
              leave that interest in the hands of the proposed Commission. </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY supposed both reports and favored the bill as originally introduced. He
              objected to expending several thousand dollars just to locate these Asylums when it
              can be better done by the General Assembly. As between the two reports, he preferred
              the minority, because it definitely locates. </p>

                  <p>The day before yesterday several gentlemen who were appointed for the purpose
                    by the Board of Trade of Indianapolis appeared before the <orgName>State Relief
                      Committee</orgName> to represent the urgent necessity that the General
                    Assembly shall pass the pending bill for the further appropriation for the
                    relief of the sufferers from the floods. I annex to this communication the
                    report of their statements. I am satisfied the present appropriation is
                    insufficient, and that a larger appropriation should be made. The present
                    appropriation has thus far been used merely for the purchasing of food, clothing
                    and medicines for the sufferers. When the flood shall have subsided the
                    suffering from injuries to property by persons in very reduced circumstances,
                    especially in towns that have been wholly or in great part submerged, will be
                    found to be so great that it will be manifest that some aid should be given to
                    such persons to render their homes habitable. If the General Assembly shall
                    desire that part of any appropriation be applied in that manner it should be

            <p>Mr. MAGEE, from the <orgName>Joint Committee on Public Buildings</orgName>, recommend
              an appropriation of $10,000 in favor of Sarah May, widow of Edwin May, late Architect
              of the New State House.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN stated that the State House Commissioners recommend the allowance of this
              claim.</p>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY was sure the recommendation of the Joint Committee in this matter should
              be sustained.</p>

            <p> Mr. MAGEE, of the <orgName>Committee on Public Buildings</orgName>, stated Mr. May
              was paid <unclear reason="faded">$[?],000</unclear> for plans worth $18,000, in order
              to complete which he mortgage after his death.</p>

            <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS said by reason of these plans the Commissioners were enabled to save
              probably $10,000.</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. BROWN the report of the Committee was concurred in by yeas, 35;
              nays, 12.</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. BROWN the Joint resolution allowing $10,000 to Mrs. Sarah May,
              widow of Edwin May, was read the first time. He moved that the Constitutional rule be
              suspended that the resolution be pressed to its passage now.</p>

            <p> Mr. McCULLOUGH resisted the motion, claiming the measure to be unjust in several
              particulars, which he mentioned. The administrator should be the applicant; then there
              is a gratuity in this sum of over $7,000. This estate should be as every other. Claims
              should be collected for the benefit of heirs and creditors-not for the widow.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN explained that Mr. May contracted indebtedness by reason of a contract
              with the State. The State has been the gainer by his death, by the appropriation of
              his work.</p>

            <p> Mr. HILLIGASS regarded the way in which this claim is pressed as begging the
              question, understanding the State House Commissioners can settle it. The heirs and
              creditors will be barred against this money which will go direct to the widow.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES opposed the claim.</p>

            <p> Mr. Magee had investigated the claim, and would not have favored it for the reasons
              referred to by the Senator from Washington [Mr. Voyles]-that of outside influence. The
              Commissioners made a hard contract with Mr. May, knowing of his necessities and taking
              advantage of them. Now, the State of Indiana can not afford to be unjust.</p>

            <p> Mr. CAMPBELL was convinced this is an equitable claim, because the Chairman of the
              Committee stated it would have cost the State this sum had the architect lived. This
              is simply a question of equity. </p>

            <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS after investigation could corroborate what is said by the Senator
              from St. Joseph [Mr. Campbell] that it is a just one, and it ought to be paid whether
              it can be collected or not.</p>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY understands this claim has the unanimous indorsement of both the State
              House Commissioners and the <orgName>Joint Committee on Public Buildings</orgName> of
              the two Houses of the General Assembly, and that is sufficient to entitle the claim to
              passage. He demanded the previous question.</p>

            <p> The demand was seconded, and under the operations of the previous question he motion
              to suspend the Constitutional rule was rejected by yeas, 31; nays, 15, two-third not
              voting in the affirmative. </p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN moved to reject the bill.</p>

            <p> Mr. BELL desired to see the Congressional Districts remain as they are, but the late
              law of Congress providing for the members of the Forty-eighth Congress is so framed
              that it requires each State to re-district for representative purposes. We ought to
              re-enact the present law, so that there shall be no mistake about Indiana's
              representation in the next Congress. He did not favor the bill.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILLARD would not oppose a bill, if there be a necessity, re-establishing the
              old apportionment. He hoped this bill would be rejected.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN was not troubled with the fears entertained by the Senator [Mr. Bell]. A
              simple <pb n="233" xml:id="VAA8558-21-232"/> resolution re-enacting the old laws will
              satisfy the Congressional demand. He opposed the bill, and would not vote for it under
              any consideration. He demanded the previous question.</p>

            <p>The demand was seconded, and under the operations of the previous question the motion

                recommendation that it be amended so that so none of the money shall be expended
                except to relieve present necessities in the way of board, clothing, bedding and
                medicine; reducing the amount to $60,000, and allowing pay to members of the Relief
                Board for expenses, and a per diem to the Lieutenant Governor; and that all

              <p>The Senate returned to the consideration of Mr. Rahm's bill [S. 87] for the
                creation of an additional Insane Asylum at Evansville.</p>

              <p> Mr. McCULLOUGH favored concurrence in the minority report, and the selection of
                the location by the General Assembly, rather than to delegate that species of
                legislation to four or five men. Evansville has many advantages among others the
                purchasing of supplies, probably, more cheaply than in any other portion of the
                State. If a location is selected in any other part of the southern portion of the
                State, it would be doing injustice not only to Evansville, but also to the entire
                State. There is no reason why the location for the southern part of the State should
                not be fixed at Evansville. </p>

              <p> Mr. VOYLES did not like to be placed in the attitude of favoring any one locality
                over another, and it is unjust to designate but one point in the bill, leaving
                others to be selected by a Committee.</p>

              <p> Mr. MAGEE favored the minority report, and was very anxious to see the bill
                advanced to the final vote and passed.</p>

              <p> Mr. FOULKE opposed the minority report. The theory of referring the question of
                selection to a Commission is that the claims of every locality may be fairly and
                justly considered, and one locality should not have any advantage over another. The
                minority report does not propose a logical or fair solution of the question: it
                simply would shut out the presentation of claims from other cities in the southern
                part of the State.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN could not see the force of the argument just made. There should be no
                Hesitancy in adopting the minority report. Evansville is located in the proper place
                geographically and has all facilities for ingress and egress, besides the advantage
                of climate. Conceding these facts why not concur in the minority report &amp;s the
                necessity is apparant for more and better accommodations for the insane? The same
                movements will be made before the Commission proposed to be created as have been
                made before this Senate: and as no city in Southern Indiana has come up here asking
                for an Asylum, except Evansville, that locality might as well be adopted and without
                further delay. </p>

              <p> Mr. FLETCHER regarded Evansville as the only place the southern portion of the
                State for the location of one of these Asylums, from the fact it has among other
                advantages cheap building material, and a large population about it. In the northern
                portion of the State there are several sides presenting equal claims, a selection
                from which it may be well to leave to the Commission. He favored the minority
                report. </p>

              <p>Mr. Van Voorhis contended if such be the case the matter can be safely left to the
                Commission because it can not go around Evansville as a location. </p>

              <p>The minority report was concurred in by yeas, 33; nays, 14, and the majority
                report, as amended by the minority, was recommenced.</p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES from a majority of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> returned
                the bill [H. R. 133] for a metropolitan police force for the city of Indianapolis
                with a favorable report.</p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS from a majority of the same Committee, submitted a report declaring
                that the bill proposes to take from Indianapolis the right of self-government, and
                the right to choose the instruments by which good order may be preserved, and compel
                them to submit to that most vicious, outrageous and unjust policy of taxation
                without representation. It may force the city to expenditures beyond the limit
                prescribed by law; it increases the public expenses of the city more than $25,000,
                and thus reduces the outlay for fire protection, street lights, sanitary provision,
                etc., etc. It is a plain and bold proposition to organize the police force for
                partisan purposes, and to give the Democratic State officers control of a large
                amount of money without accounting to anybody for its expenditure, which they may
                expend without any pretext whatever in connection with the police. The bill is
                vicious in principle and tyrannical in effect, loosely and imperfectly drawn so as
                not in any way to protect the city. The report recommends its indefinite
                postponement, and is signed by three members of the <orgName>Judiciary

            <p> Mr. SHOCKNEY hoped the bill would pass. It is a just and equitable measure. In his
              city the Water Works are located on the Indiana side, while nearly 2,000 of the
              population and many of their manufactories are located on the Ohio side, thus
              preventing the extension of mains across the line (as the law now is), and preventing
              protection to nearly one-half of their population. If this bill becomes a law under
              its provisions, large factories, machine shops, and suburban towns can be benefited by

            <p>The bill [S. 193] to extend the jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace to amend
              Section 1,418 of the Revised Statutes of 1881, was read the third time.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILSON, of Marion, believed that a bill of much more merit was introduced by
              some members of the House a few days since. He was sorry that this bill has got as far
              as it has. It would only give such cities as Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Evansville and
              New Albany one Justice of the Peace. That will not be sufficient. They must have more
              than that.</p>

            <p> Mr. STERRITT was of the opinion that the bill referred to by the gentleman from
              Marion [Mr. Wilson] was of much more merit than the bill under consideration. It
              provides for one Justice of the Peace for every 20,000 inhabitants. </p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, was opposed to this bill provided the bill referred to by
              the gentleman from Marion [Mr. Wilson] could be passed.</p>

            <p> Mr. WHITSIT thought this was a good bill, and one that would suit the people of
              Indianapolis.</p>

            <p> Mr. MELLETT thought the fewer the Justices the more highly they would be
              appreciated. One Justice of the Peace for each little incorporated town in the State

                read the third time. </p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, stated that the Committee was of the opinion that this

              <p>Mr. SHIVELY desired to state that under the present law a County is only allowed to

                of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum to convey a strip of ground on south side of said
                premises, was read he third time.</p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT thought the bill ought not to pass. He was informed that it was an
                attempt on the part of the Pennsylvania Company to grab this piece of ground. </p>

              <p>Mr. GIBSON stated hat the <orgName>Railroad Committee</orgName> went out and
                examined the grounds. He could gee nothing improper in the proposal of the Company,
                It was willing to pay whatever the Trustees demanded for the ground. </p>

              <p>Mr. MERING stated that this Company desire to lay a second track out to a point at
                which they propose to erect new shops. It will be necessary for them to secure this
                ground. The provisions of the bill are that the Trustees may dispose of this ground
                to the Company either for money or for improvements rendered by the Company. </p>

              <p>Mr. HOWLAND was of the opinion that the wall which the Company agree to build would
                be of great benefit to the Asylum property, and it was not necessary for the Company
                to construct this was to protect their own property. He favored the passage of the
                bill.</p>

              <p> Mr. SHOCKNEY believed that should this bill pass and the Pennsylvania Company
                erect the proposed shops it would greatly increase the value of the Asylum property.
                He favored the passage of the bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. SUTTON believed that the bill bad never been before the <orgName>Railroad
                  Committee</orgName>. Until he had more light concerning the provisions of the bill
                he would have to vote against it.</p>

              <p>Mr. SCHLOSS thought that the proposition made by the Company to erect the stone
                wall along the grounds was a good one.</p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, could see no objections to the measure if the Company
                desired to lay a double track. He was not certain but that the Company had adopted
                the proper plan in coming before the Legislature with their proposition.</p>

              <p>Mr. ANTRIM was opposed to the bill not because it was a railroad that desires to
                purchase its ground, but because the bill did not specify the consideration to be
                paid for the strip of ground.</p>

              <p>Mr. FRAZER thought simply because it was a Railroad Company that desired to
                purchase this ground that ought not to be an objection. </p>

              <p>Mr; PATTEN was in favor of postponing this matter.</p>

              <p>Mr. BEST did not favor the passage of the bill.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES moved to dispense with the Constitutional rule that his bill [<ref
                target="#SB_1883_01_04_173">S. 173</ref>] supplemental to the fee and salary act,
              may be passed through two readings and to the final vote. He explained it would
              prevent, constructive fees-officers violating its provisions may be removed on
              application of any taxpayers. The charging of any constructive or excessive fee by a
              County or Township official is made a cause of civil action on the part of the person
              insured, who may recover damages, in addition to the amount overcharged, of not less
              than $10 nor more than $30.</p>

            <p> The motion was agreed to-yeas, 36: nay, 4-and accordingly the bill was read the
              second time by title only.</p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM moved to amend the bill by appropriately inserting the words; "Knowingly
              tax, receive or demand any fee to which he is not entitled by the law now in force,"
              and substituting for "taxpayer" the words, "freeholder feud resident."</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE favored the first eight sections of the bill, but objected to giving the
              right to every taxpayer to have an officer removed-the 9th Section should be amended
              as Section 8 provides sufficient penalties.</p>

            <p>Mr SPANN moved to strike out Section 9. </p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM opposed this motion. It seems certain no legislation will be had on the
              fee and salary question this session that will amount to much. The trouble has been
              the abuse of the fee and salary law. In some Counties officers are receiving three and
              four times as much as the law allows. Section 8 does not impose a sufficient penalty.
              This leaves the fee bill as it is but says if officers tax any more than they may be
              removed from office. If this amendment and this bill prevail, it will be sure to stop
              this evil so much complained of all over the State. He referred to the Clerk of a
              comparatively small County, who is receiving and demanding amount $15,000 a year.
              Under the present law these officers can demand almost any fee they choose to tax. He
              desired to do all he could to prevent these abuses and hoped there was virtue enough
              in the Senate to restrain the ravages of County officers upon the people of this
              State.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES referred to the fact that Section 8 provides for a civil remedy, and if it
              be the will of the Senate to strike out Section 9 still the bill will go a long way in
              advance. If that Section is retained it probably should be amended.</p>

            <p> Mr. SAYRE regarded Section 9 as of not very great importance. If it be said this
              bill is accumulating penalties it is nothing more than what public officers have done
              by accumulating fees. Section 8 will be sufficient to restrain the taxation and
              collection of illegal fees. He favored the retention of Section 9, though the
              remainder of the bill will be productive of as much good as any law which has received
              the attention of the Senate this session. </p>

            <p> The motion to strike out Section 9 was agreed to by yeas, 83; nays, 11. </p>

            <p>The bill was considered engrossed, read the third lime and passed by yeas, 45; nays,

            <p> On motion by Mr. FLETCHER his bill [S. 101] to prevent frauds in the adulteration of
              sugars was read the second time, with Committee amendments.</p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS questioned whether there is much to be gained by the bill, except a
              lucrative field for the State Chemist, and whether there would be any benefit at all
              to the consumer. He favored this class of legislation, but of all other <pb n="238"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-237"/> things sugar is the one article that needs less
              legislation than any other. A great many other articles of food are adulterated in
              such a way as to be detrimental to health. </p>

            <p>Mr. McCLURE, so far as this bill is concerned, could see no practical advantage to be
              derived from it. The retail merchants, to be safe from prosecution, would have to
              obtain an analysis of all syrups and sugars sold by them. In order to know they would
              not violate the law. He opposed the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. FLETCHER stated the following points in favor of the bill: There is scarcely a
              pure syrup or sugar sold. Glucose and other matters of adulteration are frequently
              injurious to health. Adulteration often exists in syrups as great as 90 per cent.
              Sugar 10 to 20 per cent, one house in Chicago using 20,000 bushels of corn per day for
              sugar and syrup adulteration. The starch sugar costs less than four centers per pound,
              but used for adulteration sells for eight to ten cents per pound. The bill does not
              make the adulteration unlawful. It demands that the quantity of adulteration shall be
              made known to the purchaser. The method of securing analysis and labels is precisely
              the same as on use for determining commercial fertilizers. It encourages the sugar
              industry in Indiana, encourages home growth and manufacture, and enables the Indiana
              farmer in making pure sugar and syrup and to dispose of such pure goods without the
              competition of cheap adulterations, sold as pure, at fancy prices. It protects all
              retail dealers. It works no hardship on dealers without the State who do an honest
              business. There are not exceeding a dozen sugar refineries in the Union, and these
              make perhaps six different grades of sugar. All the analysis any one refinery would
              have to make would be these, and these once made would be good indefinitely for that
              grade or brand. Grades of straight syrups are even fewer. Refiners would have, of
              course, to make analyses for the various wholesale dealers using their goods in
              Indiana. The bill does not take a single dollar out of the public treasury of Indiana.
              After a careful examination by the <orgName>Committee of Agriculture</orgName>, the
              bill has been reported back to the Senate with the recommendation that it do pass.</p>

            <head rend="center">FLOOD SUFFERERS.</head>

            <p>On motion by Mr. BENZ the Senate took up the bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_419"
                >H. R. 419</ref>] for relief of sufferers by the flood.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES moved to amend by allowing of a reasonable sum to be applied in rendering
              habitable the recently overflowed houses of persons reduced to straightened and
              distressed circumstances.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN offered a substitute, authorizing the employment of worthy persons to
              assist in restoring the sanitary condition of the flooded districts, and righting up
              the property of the destitute, thus accomplishing a double purpose-assisting the
              distressed, and at the same time relieving the wants of the worker's family.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY thought the able-bodied citizens who receive relief should be required to
              assist the destitute to fix up their homes-that is a much better way. The Committees
              in the various towns can better direct the work in their own towns. It would be an
              unsafe thing to allow this Commission to hire men.</p>

            <p> Mr. BENZ opposed the amendment. Each town has its own <orgName>Relief
                Committee</orgName> and it knows best what shall be done. He favored an
              appropriation of $100,000. Those sufferers need provisions and clothing. From
              Cincinnati to below Mount Vernon money is needed. This Commission will not take the
              money out of the Treasury unless it is needed.</p>

            <p> Mr. McCLURE believed these matters should be left to the <orgName>Relief
                Committees</orgName> of the various localities. There are blocks after blocks of
              poor laborers' cottages, where bed, bedding and furniture, or whatever water could
              destroy, were destroyed in Jeffersonville, and they will need such supplies for a
              month to come. Only thirty blocks or squares were exempt from overflow. Nearly every
              grocery and dry goods store were flooded and but little saved.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN was inclined to the opinion that the bill had better be left alone, having
              full confidence in the Commission. It is more capable of doing what ought to be done
              than the Legislature. These amendments may tend to defeat the bill. He desired to see
              the bill passed as it came from the House.</p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN withdrew his substitute-not desiring to endanger the passage of the bill. </p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES explained the object of his amendment to be to fix more certainly some of
              the duties of the Relief Commission.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY: The best argument that the amendment should not go in is that Senators
              representing the flooded district are opposed to it.</p>

            <p> Mr. MAY, living in the flooded district, believed the appropriation should not be
              restricted by the proposed amendment; the local Relief Committee should be left free
              to act as they think best in such matters.</p>

            <p> The amendment [Mr. Voyles'] was rejected.</p>

            <p> Mr. RAHM had a talk with the Commissioners, especially the Governor, who recommended
              no greater appropriation than $60,000, which would be used in relieving the sufferers
              in any way the Commissioners may see fit, and that is the reason he consented to the
              reduction. </p>

            <p>Mr. HENRY offered the Committee amendment adopted yesterday (but left out in the
              engrossment), reducing the amount appropriated from $100,000 to $60,000.</p>

            <p>This amendment was agreed to by yeas, 21; nays, 20.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. HENRY the bill was read the third time-</p>

            <p>Mr. MARVIN voted against the other bill, for the reason lie didn't believe any law
              authorize the vote of a dollar in this way, and he should vote against this bill for
              this and other reasons. </p>

            <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS thought it directly in the line of duty for the State to take care of
              her poor. </p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM: It is the duty of the Legislature to practice economy, but not to shut
              its eyes to suffering.</p>

            <p> Mr. DUNCAN: The duty of taking care of the poor devolves upon Boards of County
              Commissioners, but a great public calamity has befallen the people so that the local
              authorities can not provide for the wants of those persons; and in such cases the
              Legislature has the power.</p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN had not seen anything to change his opinion, as a lawyer and as a Senator,
              that the principle of voting this money is a wrong one, and will return to plague the
              people of this State in the future. </p>

            <p>The bill passed by yeas, 37; nays, 7, with an amendment of title striking out
              $100,000 and inserting $60,000 in lieu. </p>

              <head rend="center">RAILROAD TARIFF.</head>

              <p> On motion by Mr. McCULLOUGH his bill [S. 19] defining unjust discriminations of
                railroads in rates of charges for transportation of freight or passengers, was read
                the second time with a Committee report recommending that it lie on the table.</p>

              <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH: He nor the people he represented have no quarrel with the
                railroads, but there are many unlawful wrongs being perpetuated by Railroad
                Companies, which, the Legislature of Indiana must consider and right sooner or
                later, and the sooner the better in justice both to the people of the State and to
                the Railroad Companies. His bill does not propose to fix any rate per mile, but to
                prevent charging more for conveying twenty five miles than for conveying fifty
                miles, or as much for conveying twenty-five as for thirty miles. There is not a
                clause in the bill prohibiting a Railroad Company from doing anything but what is
                palpably unlawful tinder the present law. The person overcharged may recover that
                amount, and in addition a sum sufficent to pay the expenses of the suit. In the
                decision of all Courts, wherever the question has arisen, it has uniformly been
                decided, and the Courts have held that railroads have no right to make the
                discriminations they do make, and that everybody knows they make Railroad men
                generally admit that they do make discriminations such as are in violation of law,
                but there is no excuse for the Legislature to permit it. Every time a Railroad
                Company violates the provisions of this bill they violate the law as effectually as
                a mob that would stop their trains. It is not justice to the people of the State
                that they should come continually to the Courts, as they do, claiming the protection
                of the State. Why, they themselves say, "We will not obey the laws of the State."
                The Legislature will be recreant to its trusts if it does not come speedily to the
                relief of the people of the State and stop the gross, outrageous and unlawful
                discrimination continually being perpetuated by Railroad Companies. He spoke at
                length in opposition to concurrence in the report of the Committee.</p>

              <p>Mr CAMPBELL cemented it was the duty of the General Assembly to throw round th
                people a protection from outrages and unjust railroad discriminations. He bad no
                desire to wage war upon the railroads, but the magnitude of this problem deserves
                careful consideration, which urged the Senate to give to this Question, His bill
                says but little on the railroad legislation, out proposes a Railroad Commisison with
                instructions to prevent unjust railroad discrimination. There is a necessity for
                arbitration between railroads themselves, as there is a necessity for arbitration of
                railroads and the people. There is unjust and extortionate charges made between
                intermediate points by nearly all Railroad Companies, and some thing should be clone
                for the correction of the evil. Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and various other
                States have similar Commissions, but the best of all is the one in Georgia, from
                which his bill is made up. This plan has been in operation in Georgia since <unclear
                  reason="faded">18[?]9</unclear>, and has been found to work satisfactory and to
                bring the railroad authorities and the people on better terms than were ever known
                before. In conclusion he asked the Senate to consider this subject carefully and
                refuse to concur in the report of the Committee recommending that the bill lie on
                the table. </p>

              <p> On motion by Mr. Voyles, the Governor's veto of his bill [S. 91] for the more
                efficient government of the Indiana reform School for Boys, was read. Some of His
                Excellency's objections are: The terms of office of all but one of the Trustees of
                the House of Refuge have expired. Dr. William Freeman runs under the appointment
                until as March 1, 1885 The present bill, however, puts an end to Dr. Freeman's term
                of office. I refuse to make myself a party to this proceeding, which I would do by
                giving my approval to the bill now returned. Section 13 provides that boys, for
                whatever cause committed, may at any time be discharged or released on trial by the
                Board of Control. In the case of a person convicted of crime, it not being treason
                or a case of impeachment, the power of pardon resides under the Constitution in the
                Governor. The Governor may pardon absolutely or conditionally, but the power can not
                be transferred by the Legislature to any other person or to any body of persons. It
                is not pleasant to be obliged to differ from a majority of the Legislature on the
                propriety of the passage of a bill, but it seems to me to be a plain duty to return
                this bill with an earnest expression of disapproval. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN hoped the Governor's veto would be sustained. He could not sit by and see
                such a wrong perpetuated simply for party purposes. The history of this State has
                not shown so much iniquitous legislation purely and simply for partisan purposes as
                has been enacted this session. The bill legislates out of office men who have done
                their duty well and faithfully. There has been no charge against any of them one of
                them, in whom there is no guile, a brother of a former Governor, who has been
                honored since his inception into politics, and now in his old age when he asked as a
                crumb that he be continued in office; they turned out to die, because he would not
                be controled and whipped in like a dog by Democratic caucuses. Where is the
                necessity of legislating Finley Bigger out of office? Only for the purpose of
                satisfying the greed of a party which has been out of power for twenty years. Then
                it legislates out of office a soldier, who has done his whole duty. The history of
                the future will bear out toe prophecy that in the next two years soar reformatory
                institutions will need investigation. Then he believed the bill to be of doubtful
                Constitutionality. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE would leave to Democratic conscience the propriety of passing a bill
                which purpose it is to legislate out of office an old soldier, who has performed
                faithfully his duties: but there is a question beyond that the question of the
                Constitutionality of this bill. It has been claimed all doubt; should be given on
                the side of the Constitution and against our right to legislate, but in this case
                there is no doubt the provision against the Constitutionality of this bill is as
                plain as black and white. The lower of pardon is placed by the Constitution
                exclusively in the hands of the Governor, while under this bill the Board of Control
                of this Institution may discharge or release on trial. That can be done by no power
                in the world but the Executive, and by the letter of the law that bill is
                unconstitutional. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES was surprised any good lawyer would say there was any question at, all
                of a Constitutional character. This section now objected to has been in the law for
                sixteen years last past. This bill is a fair and just revision of all laws <pb
                  n="240" xml:id="VAA8558-21-239"/> upon this subject. He understands the Republican
                legislated out of office has been negligent in his duties in being absent from ten
                out of twenty four meetings of the Board in the past two years. </p>

              <p>Mr. YANCEY opposed the bill because it is not of his political complexion. He would
                not object go seriously in turning out Union soldiers occasionally if the Democratic
                party were not so much in the habit of turning in soldiers who fought on the other
                side. To day there are Benevolent Institutions governed by men who did everything in
                then power to destroy the institutions of their country.</p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY: Compared with some political measures thrust upon us this session, this
                is a small affair. It is not pretended that the provisions of this bill are an
                improvement upon the laws of the Statute books. It is policy of Democrats to fill
                the offices if they can get the. The Insane Asylum of the State of Indiana, so far
                as subordinate positions are concerned, is a House of Refuge for the Confederate
                Army. The bill is an outrage and ought not to pass. </p>

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM made an objection to the bill when before the Senate originally, that it
                was in violation to the Constitution. It might prove a serious matter if by this
                bill this Institution should be left without any government at all. The Senator from
                Cass the other day admitted the purpose of the bill was to change its management.
                The Institution was going along very well and there is no complaint of the Statute.
                governing this Institution. Is not this bill an infamous and high handed outrage,
                and is there not virtue enough on the Democratic side of the Chamber to say we will
                go no further in this direction? In the light of this bill he felt like prophesying
                that in both ends of this General Assembly in two years from now instead of a
                Democratic a Republican majority will be found. </p>

              <p> Mr. HILLIGASS deprecated the wide range of this discussion, especially its
                political direction. He referred to seven Democratic Senators with honorable
                discharges from the Union Army, and comes with bad grace for their fellow Senators
                to charge them with standing cheek by jowl with Confederate soldiers, and that there
                is nothing that can be admired in the Democratic party. WE have set patiently and
                listened to such tirades day in and day out till forbearance ceases to be a virtue.
                He demanded the previous question.</p>

              <p> The demand was seconded by yeas, 28; nays, 19, and under the operations of the
                previous question the bill was passed, the Governor's objections to the contrary
                notwithstanding, by yeas, 28; nays, 20.</p>

              <p> The Senate then adjourned. </p>

          <p>Mr. HELMS introduced a bill [H. R. 462] to amend Section 2,537 of Revised Statutes of
            1881, to provide for the running at large of all kind of stock.</p>

          <p>Mr. CAMPBELL moved that the Constitutional rules be suspended that that bill be pressed
            to the final vote.</p>

          <p> Mr. PATTEN opposed the motion. It is not such a bill as ought to pass this House. It
            is simply making bad worse.</p>

          <p> Mr. CAMPBELL: If this bill is not such as should pass the House he would like for the
            gentleman from Sullivan [Mr. Patten] to tell the House what kind of a bill the House
            should pass for the relief of those persons who are petitioning for relief.</p>

          <p> Mr. SHIVELY hoped that the rules would be suspended and the bill put upon its
            passage.</p>

          <p> The rule was suspended by yeas, 70; nays, 17, and the bill was read the second time by
            title, and the third time by sections.</p>

          <p> Mr. PATTEN did not think the bill would remedy the evil it was intended to. The bill
            preposes to prevent the County Commissioners from restraining animals running at large.
            Its purpose is to relieve those persons, who have lost their fencing by the floods, and
            when it is carefully examined it will be found to compel those men who have suffered
            from this flood to stop and make fencing to keep up their own stock. Whenever a true
            attempt was made to relieve the suffering he was always willing and ready to lend his
            assistance, but this bill will undoubtedly work a hardship on a great many persons. A
            great many tenant farmers have their hogs and sheep running at large, and it would be
            unjust to cause them to keep them up. It is the poor class of men and the tenant farmers
            that need legislation.</p>

          <p> Mr. MUTZ was astonished that any member would get up here and oppose this measure in
            the favor of the poor man's cow. No good farmer or good tenant ever fails to have rails
            enough to fence up his own stock. The people along the Flat Rock and Blue Rivers, being
            his constituents, have appealed to him to secure the passage of such a law in order that
            they might have an opportunity to save their crops. He moved the previous question on
            the passage of the bill. </p>

          <p>The demand was seconded, and, under the operations of the previous question, the bill
            was rejected by yeas, 41; nays, 52.</p>

          <p> Mr. SHIVELY entered a motion to reconsider the vote. </p>

            <head rend="center">PAY DAY EVERY MONTH.</head>

            <p>Mr. Antrim's bill [H. R. 14] to require all companies and corporations to make
              settlement and payment to their employes at least once every thirty days, being read
              the third time.</p>

            <p> Mr. ANTRIM stated that the bill was not introduced through any animosity to the
              companies or corporations, but it subject is simply to compel such companies and
              associations to settle with their employes at least once every thirty days. The
              employes in this part of the State had suffered great injustice by the companies,
              getting behind with said employes, and when they received their money not getting but
              a small per cent. of the amount actually due them for their labor. If this bill works
              any hardships it is simply a question of whether the Company is to sustain that
              hardship or whether it will continue to be imposed upon the laboring men, who are the
              least able to sustain it, and who can not command credit. The penalty is not to crush
              the Company, but simply to compel them to pay every honest debt to its employes. He
              knew men in his own County last winter to whom a certain company were owing $200 and
              yet that man did not have enough money to buy his family a turkey dinner on Christmas
              Day. He desired to ask if this is right? The bill is in the interest of a class of men
              who are not filling the lobbies and working in the interest of this measure, but they
              are our constituents, and we are here to work for them just as much as for the
              interests of the wealth of our State, and they deserve just as much at our hands.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILSON, of Marion, was a sympathetic man<pb n="241" xml:id="VAA8558-21-240"/>
              with the working class. This bill provides that companies or corporations must pay
              every thirty days, anyhow. It provides for no contingencies, and in case such a
              contingency should arise, the Company would be compelled to pay this penalty, not to
              the employe but to the State Treasury, and if a receiver is appointed the result would
              be the same. He thought it would be wrong for the bill in its present shape to become
              a law.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, thought this unwise legislation. It smacks too much of that
              old English law of imprisonment for debt. He did not think the author intended any
              unwise or unjust legislation, but he was satisfied that the bill would work unjustly
              against the companies and corporations. A Railroad Company might have trouble in
              negotiating a loan or the pay can be unavoidably delayed, or the Company suffer
              temporary embarrassment, and in such cases the money that otherwise would go to the
              employes would go into the State Treasury or to pay an attorney fee.</p>

            <p> Mr. MOODY could not see where the bill would work a hardship. It simply provides
              that these companies, corporations or associations should pay their employes once
              every thirty days. And why not, when the law presents a penalty for a man not paying
              his note when it is due? There is nothing wrong about this bill, and it should
              pass.</p>

            <p> Mr. MONTGOMERY was one of the Committee that made a unanimous report in favor of the
              passage of this bill. He thought it should become a law. He thought it was in the
              interest of the laboring constituents of every member of the House, and he did not
              think it would be a hardship for the companies to pay once every thirty days.</p>

            <p> Mr. PATTEN could not see anything very wrong in compelling companies and
              corporations to pay their debts once every thirty days- to pay for the labor that
              created their capital. He thought that the principle of this legislation is right.
              These employes furnished the muscle, the skill and the labor to create this capital,
              and they should have the first earnings. </p>

            <p> Mr. JEWETT favored the principles embodied in this bill, and would very much like to
              see corporations and companies compelled to bay their debts in a reasonable time, but
              it appeared to him that this bill was not sufficiently guarded, and that the
              corporations, under the provisions of this bill, may be made liable for their own
              misfortunes. </p>

            <p> With the consent of the House Mr. JEWETT offered the following amendment, by adding
              to the last section a proviso: "That any corporation, association or joint-stock
              company may be exempted from the penalties of the act upon application showing good
              cause by order of the Judge of the Circuit Court of any County in which said
              corporation, association or company may at the time be engaged in business." He was
              willing to take the statement of the gentleman from Miami [Mr. Antrim] who has by his
              course on this floor shown himself to be a good lawyer, that this is a good bill. This
              bill is just to the workingmen, and Heaven knows there is little enough legislation
              for these men.</p>

            <p> Mr. MELLETT favored the passage of the bill with the amendment. He thought that some
              legislation on this subject was necessary. He believed that the sentiment of the House
              was in favor of the passage of the bill, and he hoped no copious objection would be
              made to any amendment that might be made. </p>

            <p>Mr. Jewett's amendment was adopted, and on his motion the amendment was considered
              engrossed and the bill passed the House by yeas, 84; nays, 7.</p>

            <p> Mr. McMULLEN moved to take up the bill [H. R. 91] concerning the relocation of
              County seats-Jennings County Court House bill-and which bill failed to pass on
              February 6 for want of a Constitutional majority. </p>

            <p>The motion was agreed to and the bill passed the House by yeas, 54; nays, 35. </p>

            <head rend="center">ROAD TAX.</head>

            <p>Mr. STEWART'S bill [H. R. 23] to amend Section 27 of an act concerning roads and
              highways, so as to permit of the working out of road tax in the same manner as the law
              provided previous to 1881, was read the third time.</p>

            <p> Mr. STEWART explained that the bill simply amended Section 27, by providing that
              both poll and property tax may be paid in work, and that the Supervisor should issue
              certificates to such persons, which certificates the County Treasurer shall receive in
              payment of such taxes. He thought this bill should pass and not run the risk of
              another bill passing which would include the same provision.</p>

            <p> Mr. JEWETT thought the passage of this bill might embarrass the passage of regular
              road laws and he would, therefore, vote against it.</p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY said: I am opposed to the present road law, and my people, without any
              exception, are opposed to the law. During my entire campaign I heard no voice raised
              in favor of the law, and for this reason I am in favor of any measure that will
              relieve my people from the effects of the present odious law. I voted two years ago
              for the present law upon the understanding that the bill was amended just as this bill
              proposes to amend it. In fact, I refused to vote for the bill two years ago for the
              reason that the law would not permit persons to work out their road tax upon the
              highway if they desired to do so. An amendment was then proposed and agreed to, or
              rather a proviso, which gentlemen will find in Section 27 of the present law, that was
              intended to apply to Section 10 of the law instead of Section 16, enabling parties to
              work out their tax instead of paying the money by applying to the Superintendent. The
              present law is not what we want, and gentlemen say to vote for this amendment will
              defeat the Senate and House bills prepared on this question with great care, and for
              that reason we should vote against this bill. If I knew that the Senate or House bill
              would be passed, then I would not care for this amendment; but how can we defend
              ourselves before our constituents if we defeat this bill, which, if passed, will cure
              the most obnoxious feature of the present law, and neither of the other bills is
              passed? I promised my people all over my County to do all in my power to repeal the
              dog law, the decedent act, the road law, the oats bill and the proposed prohibitory
              amendment tot he Constitution, and I have done all in my power to carry out this
              pledge. I do trust that this bill will pass; and then, if we can pass the House bill,
              which is claimed to be an improvement on the present law, well and good, and if they
              fail, we can have the consolation at least, of knowing that when the opportunity
              presented itself to better the present law we did not fail to embrace it.</p>

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN did not think it best to take favorable action on this bill. He favored
              having the Committee report at once on the road bill passed by the Senate, and take
              action on that bill without further delay.</p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, was in favor of this amendment, and then he would favor a
              general road law.</p>

            <p> Mr. BEESON thought that, in the interest of the people, this bill should not be
              voted down. He was in favor of passing the amendment to the present road law. </p>

            <p> The bill passed the House by yeas, 69; nays, 26.</p>

            <p> Mr. Muck entered a motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill passed.</p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT'S bill [H. R. 26] to repeal Section 6 of an act concerning promissory
              notes, bills of exchange, bonds or other instruments in writing <pb n="242"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-241"/> signed by any person who promises to pay money, was read a
              third time.</p>

            <p> Mr. SHIVELY hoped that the bill would not pass. He did not believe that the business
              or the farmers' interests demanded a repeal of that part of our statute; and he was
              satisfied it would result in more harm than good. Thirty-five- States have similiar
              laws upon their statute books and thus far there had been no effort to repeal said
              provisions of these statutes; and not only that, but every country of Europe have
              similar laws. In England and the German Empire, in every Nation, the commercial
              interests are protected by similar provisions.</p>

            <p>Mr. GORDON stated that the bill had been discussed several days back, and he
              therefore moved the previous question, which was seconded by the House. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT desired to say that this bill to repeal this statute will not prevent the
              collection of any honest note in the State of Indiana. It will simply prevent the
              collection of notes obtained by fraud and crime. The State Grange, as an organization
              representing the farming element of the State, has asked me repeal of this law, and up
              to this, the 22d of February, every demand has been refused, and this is the last
              opportunity to make any response so this request. The only objection that has been
              raised against this bid has come from bankers and note shavers.</p>

            <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 64; nays, 34. </p>

            <p>Mr. Henderson's bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_029">H. R. 29</ref>] to enable the
              several Counties in the State to sell and dispose of land for the benefit of the
              school fund, was read the third time. </p>

            <p>Mr. HENDERSON stated the provisions of the bill granted a reappraisement of certain
              lands, once sold, but abandoned by the parties purchasing after they have deposited
              the land of timber. It was necessary that the land be reappraised, and he hoped that
              the bill would pass. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH favored the provisions of the bill.</p>

            <p> The bill passed the House by yeas, 87; nays 3. </p>

            <p>Mr. HOLLER'S bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_031">H. R. 31</ref>] to authorize
              Boards of County Commissioners to grant bounties for the destruction of woodchucks,
              owls and hawks, was read the third time and passed the House by yeas 66; nays, 19.</p>

            <p> Mr. FRAZER'S bill [H. R. 38] for taxing the ownership of property for school
              purposes, was read the third time and passed the House by yeas, 80; nays, 11.</p>

            <p> Mr. MOCK'S bill [H. R. 48] to provide for the election of Supervisors of highways,
              was read the third time.</p>

            <p> Mr. MOCK thought it was the sentiment of the House that some road law should pass.
              He did not desire to stand in the way of any member voting for the bill which had
              passed the Senate on the same subject, but he hoped the members would vote for this
              bill for fear the Senate bill might not pass.</p>

            <p> Mr. MONTGOMERY was in favor of any good road law, and therefore he would vote for
              this bill. The Senate bill only allows the Supervisor $1.50 per day, and he thought it
              was better in this respect than the bill under consideration.</p>

            <p> Mr. BEESON did not favor the passage of the bill, and he was of the opinion that his
              constituents were willing give the present law a further trial.</p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, was pledged to vote for a change in the road law, but as
              this bill had passed the point where it could be amended except by unanimous consent,
              he thought it ought not to be passed by the House at the present time. </p>

            <p>Mr. MUTZ desired to state to the House that there had been a great cry going no all
              over the State for the repeal of this road law. Everybody is against it. The people
              can never be educated up to favoring the present road law. He moved the previous
              question on the passage of the bill. </p>

            <p>The demand was seconded, and under its operation the bill passed the House by yeas,
              70; nays, 7.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. McHenry the bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_283">S. 283</ref>] to
              abolish the Criminal Court in Alien County was amended by striking out "January 1" and
              inserting in lieu thereof "October 31," and passed the House by yeas, 90; nays, 0,
              under a suspension of the rules.</p>

            <p>The bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_173">S. 173</ref>] to fix the fees of certain
              officers was read the first time.</p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT called up the bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_419">H. R. 419</ref>] to
              appropriate the sum of $100,000 for the relief of the sufferers from the floods of the

          <p>The reading of the minutes was dispensed with.</p>

          <p> On motion by Mr. VAN VORHIS the joint resolution [S. -] to pay $10,000 to the widow of
            Edwin May, late architect of the new State House, was taken up-yeas, 26; nays, 13-and
            read the second time.</p>

          <p> Mr. McCULLOUGH moved to reduce the sum to $3,000. There is no law, equity or common
            honesty in this resolution as it stands.</p>

          <p> Mr. HENRY contended the claim was just, because the widow lost her interest in her
            home by reason of mortgage put upon it in order to enable Mr. May to carry out his
            contract with the State.</p>

          <p> Mr. MAGEE repelled any insinuation of improper motives influencing the Committee.</p>

          <p> Mr. VOYLES, while not willing to recognize that the claim should be more than $800,
            was willing to vote for the amendment out of a spirit of compromise.</p>

          <p> Mr. SPANN and Mr. BELL favored the passage of the resolution.</p>

          <p> Mr. HILLIGASS said it is not clear that the claim is equitable. Six thousand dollars
            was paid this architect by the State for those plans, and in addition near $3,000 for
            two years' superintendence of the work. He was willing to compromise on as much as
            $5,000.</p>

          <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS demanded the previous question.</p>

          <p> The Senate seconded the demand, and under the operations of the previous question the
            amendment to reduce the sum to $3,000 was rejected by yeas, 17; nays, 25. The joint

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p> Mr. GRAHAM moved to suspend the order of business that he may introduce a resolution
              for the appointment of a Committee of Five to proceed forthwith to examine the State
              Treasury, to investigate the condition of all funds with which the State Treasurer is
              charged, to ascertain if any of the public funds have been loaned in violation of law,
              the sum and security for such loan, and report the examination to the Senate at the
              earliest day possible. He referred to defalcations of Treasurers; in other States, and
              desired to prevent any such sorry experience in this State. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN referred to the fact that a Republican Treasurer of State was in office
              when the Senate convened, and remained so until the past eight or ten days, and yet
              this sense of duty didn't arise on the part of the Senator from Hamilton [Mr.
              Graham.]</p>

            <p>Mr. GRAHAM explained that the provocation for this resolution has come to light since
              the Democratic Treasurer' came into office. </p>

              <head rend="center">CROSSING OF RAILROAD.</head>

              <p> Mr. CAMPBELL called up a special order, the bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_138"
                  >S. 138</ref>] concerning railroads crossing each other on a common grade, which
                was read the third time.</p>

              <p> Mr. VOYLES moved to add to Section 1 a proviso that where the electric system
                referred to is adopted it shall not be put in unless with the consent of the
                Railroad Company.</p>

              <p> It was so ordered by consent.</p>

              <p> Mr. WILLARD would like to have them explained-it looks like a plan to get in a
                patent right.</p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE explained that the signal always set to danger. This is probably the
                only appliance that is in use When the train comes within about a mile of the
                crossing mere is an Insulated track which changes the switch by an automatic
                arrangement. The arrangement is such that two trains can not possibly meet each
                other at the crossing, and this will obviate the necessity of trains stopping at all
                crossings. </p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN said this bill was similar to an Ohio law. The point is this: When a
                train comes within half a mile or so of a crossing it changes the switch so that
                were another train coming from another way and attempt to pass the crossing it would
                go into the ditch. This system has been adopted in the interest of preservation of
                life. This bill protects no inventor, but is rather an encouragement for it provides
                for the adoption of the best system.</p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY showed there is nothing mandatory about the bill. In Ohio the cost to
                railroads for stopping at crossings was $2,497,000 last year.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN said this bill does not effect the old law, as where this protection is
                not adopted, the old law remains the same. </p>

              <p>The bill passed by yeas, 36; nays 4. </p>

              <head rend="center">CONTRACT CONVICT LABOR.</head>

              <p> A special order being the bill [S. 281] to abolish contract convict labor, and
                regulating the employment of the convicts of our State Prisons, and of the inmates
                of our Reform Schools, as well as providing for the maintenance of said
                Institutions; also repealing all laws in conflict herewith, and declaring an
                emergency, was read the second time, as was also the bill [S. 241] for the more
                profitable and equitable hiring by the State of the convicts in the State Prison,
                and to amend Section 10 of the State Prison act-See page 167 of the Brevier
                Reports.</p>

              <p> Mr. JOHNSON said:</p>

              <p> Mr. P<hi rend="sc">RESIDENT</hi>-In the report accompanying this bill which has
                been printed I have given most of the reasons which have induced the Committee
                appointed to look into the subject of Contract Prison labor to recommend its
                passage. There is not one Senator on this floor who does not know that the
                complaints about our present system of convict labor have become so general that the
                outcry against the wrongs inflicted by this system, both on manufacturers and
                workingmen, has become so loud and persistent that this General Assembly ought to
                heed this universal demand and apply the remedy, if it be possible to find one. Mr.
                President, from all parts and sections of this State petitions, signed by hundreds
                or thousands of legal voters, have come to this Senate and have been referred to
                your Special Committee for action, and all these <pb n="245" xml:id="VAA8558-21-244"
                /> petitions demanded that this system be abolished and that the incubus thereby
                imposed upon the manufacturing interests and the laborers of our State should be
                removed. At the present time the State of Indiana, which should be guardian and
                protector of honest labor and free industry within its borders, is placed in the
                anomalous position of being their enemy and opponent by upholding and sanctioning a
                ruinous competition which has seriously injured these interests for years past, and
                must finally destroy them.</p>

              <p> In the report accompanying the bill I have already compared the prices of Prison
                and free labor in various manufactures, and this comparison goes to show that the
                Prison labor is so much cheaper that the manufacturer employing only honest and free
                labor must either close his factory, because he is unable to compete with the
                convict labor contractor, or he must press down the wages he pays to his men to the
                starving point, and even then his profits will be so small and uncertain that it
                hardly pays him to remain in the field. Mr. President, I have the honor to represent
                on this floor a County where the ruinous effects of Prison labor have made
                themselves felt. There are hundreds of workingmen in the city of Lafayette whose
                hearts are throbbing with anguish and hope, and whose eyes are looking with intense
                expectation towards this Assembly, waiting and waiting, whether anything will be
                done to relieve their distress and help their wants. There are thousands of honest
                workingmen in my County whose wages are cut down by the unfair competition of the
                State, and who are on that account must not only themselves <unclear
                  reason="faded/missing">[?]</unclear> little comforts of life, but must also be the
                sad and powerless witnesses of their wives' and childrens' misery and want,
                powerless to help them, powerless to furnish a comfortable home, or even the bread,
                fuel and clothes for their little ones! What wonder, Mr. President, if society, nay,
                if the State itself turns against these laboring classes and instead of protecting
                them, helps to cripple their resources and to reduce their income; what wonder, say,
                that our Prisons are filled with convicts and that honest manufacturers are
                compelled to suspend? </p>

              <p> There is but one claim which the advocates of Prison labor advance, which speaks
                in its favor- that contract Prison labor makes the Penitentiaries self-sustaining.
                But, Mr. President, this claim is a spurious one. It is rather based on the
                appearance of a reality than on the reality itself. The Prisons would be
                self-sustaining if the articles and labor produced there would really create the
                means needed for their support and maintenance, without detracting from other
                industries. This is not hte case. On the contrary, the money earned by the labor of
                the convicts is withdrawn from the free laborers and mechanics of our State employed
                in similar or like factories and workshops and from their employers. If the convict
                labor would cease to be employed in making barrels, chairs, carriages, cigars, boots
                and shoes, etc., the free laborers of our State would make them at a higher rate of
                wages than they at present receive, and consequently, instead of being
                self-sustaining, Penitentiaries are sustained by the money which this unfair
                competition takes out of the pockets of the honest workingmen and their employers.
                As it is the manufacturers and laborers in the above named articles are taxed solely
                and exclusively for maintaining the Penitentiaries; this tax imposed upon them
                houses, feeds and clothes the criminal and felon, but it ruins and breaks up the
                manufacturers, and it drives the honest laborer into poverty and sometimes into
                crime. Is it possible that a great State can sanction and continue this injustice
                and this wrong after its legal representatives have become aware and conscious of
                it? Such a presumption would be an insult to the State and its Legislative branch of
                Government. Your Committee has been guided by these considerations in seeking and
                applying the remedy.</p>

              <p> Now, Mr. President, we know that this country has established a high tariff for
                the sake of maintaining and protecting American manufactures and industries. By
                means of this tariff we sustain home manufactures. Many millions of dollars are
                annually paid out by the citizens of the United States on articles of every day use
                and wear, and there is no other reason for it than this one, that every dollar paid
                out in this way helps to build up and support our own manufactures. And yet, Mr.
                President, it is not at all certain whether the mechanics and workingmen of this
                country are benfited in proportion to the protection which the tariff affords. The
                question is now, can not the State of Indiana, in behalf of its own industries and
                for the sake of protecting the laborers and mechanics of our State, impose a small
                tax upon every citizen, such as proposed in this bill by maintaining the convicts,
                which compared to the immense tax imposed upon us by the protective tariff, is very
                small and insignificant? </p>

              <p> Mr. President, I have no time to exhaust this subject. But it is of serious
                importance and of urgent necessity. Let, through me, the many thousand laborers of
                this State, who are to-day poorly paid and only half employed, appeal to the Senate
                for help and redress. So far only the vast and exhaustless resources which
                Providence has poured out upon us, with lavish hands, have guided this land safely
                through the dangers and perils of social revolutions.</p>

              <p> But, Mr. President, with increasing population and with the aggregation of many
                people at certain centers of trade and industry, the danger of social revolution
                increases. f in the distant horizon we perceive clouds which may contain the fatal
                thunderbolt which may at a given moment burst upon and destroy our social and
                political fabric of Government, then it is our duty to guard against it and dispel
                that cloud. The great mass of the people, the laboring element, that healthy,
                industrious, economical and noble element, upon whose strengths, intelligence and
                virtue this Republic rests, is no danger to our institutions, but let this great and
                strong and powerful element also know that the State protects, helps and sustains it
                in all its legitimate aspirations and demands.</p>

              <p> Mr. CAMPBELL regarded this question as especially deserving of careful and
                deliberate consideration. The importance and magnitude of the problem demand
                immediate attention from a common sense, business standpoint. The difference between
                this bill [S. 241] and the bill [S. 281] is that the latter proposes to abolish
                contract convict labor, while this bill proposes to put ablebodied convicts in
                honorable competition so their product will bring as high a price as their products
                will bring in the market.</p>

              <p> Mr. YANCEY moved to amend the bill [S. 247] by adding a section requiring a brand
                with these words, "manufactured by convict labor." in justice to honesty and fair
                dealing, as between man and man.</p>

              <p> Mr. CAMPBELL believed that would depreciate the products of the labor, which is
                directly opposite to the object of the bill. </p>

              <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS had looked somewhat into the manner in which the Reformatory
                interests are managed. He favored, as between these two, the bill S. 281. If there
                is any vicious thing in these Institutions above another it is the custom in vogue
                in some of them in places of hiring a teacher to instruct those put under them, they
                hire out the Mechanical Departments and require the inmates to work as the
                contractor directs. All incentive to educate them in the mechanical arts is taken
                away. The Institutions ought to be kept on such a basis as to educate these pupils,
                who have lost part of their senses, so they may be able to compete in their work
                with the more fortunate competitors. </p>

              <pb n="246" xml:id="VAA8558-21-245"/>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD offered a substitute for the amendment requiring a stamp, "convict made
                goods," to be affixed on all Prison-made goods. He heartily approved of the bill
                introduced by the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Johnson], but the contracts already
                made will not expire until 1887, and for that reason he offers this amendment so as
                to reach the immediate needs of the laboring men in this State. As he understood the
                bill S. 241 its provisions are not desirable. This substitute will not interfere
                with existing contracts, and will bring immediate relief, while not materially
                injuring the contractors, because they have already a sufficient protection in their
                enormous profits. Then his substitute requires the same rule to hold and effect
                Prison-made goods to go out branded from this time forth, just what they are.</p>

              <p> Mr. GRAHAM moved to add to the bill [S. 241] a new Section so as to require the
                contract price for labor to be not less than seventy-five cents per day. Such labor
                should raise a fund sufficient to maintain the Prison. A large portion of this kind
                of skilled labor only brings to the State forty cents a day. Any ordinary labor
                should bring more than that. These contracts for Prison labor are strange things, no
                doubt, if the truth could be got at. This thing ought to be regulated by the
                Legislature, and there should be a fixed price.</p>

              <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS moved to amend the bill [S. 281] so as to include the Benevolent as
                well as Reformatory Institutions, and authorizing these to employ teachers to
                instruct the pupils in such mechanical arts as may be most to the advantage of such
                pupils and inmates.</p>

              <p> This amendment was agreed to.</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN was heartily in favor of the passage of the bill. He regarded it as
                doing a wrong to the laboring men of the State for the State to let out convict
                labor, as has been the custom. It is a broad and comprehensive bill. He would not
                compromise this proposition by letting out this labor on competitive contracts. He
                favored applying the principles of this bill to the Reformatory Institutions. The
                State ought to be proud enough and grand enough to give her prisoners employment.
                They had better be put to agricultural pursuits.</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN moved to strike out the third section of the bill S. 281, making each
                County liable for the support of convicts therefrom-less the amount earned by the
                convicts. He opposed both bills. All this talk about convict contractors having any
                effect upon the price of labor is absolutely ridiculous. It does not operate in the
                slightest degree upon the fixing of wages of laboring men throughout the State.
                Under Democratic management, for the past few years, the Penitentiaries are
                self-supporting, because the wise law on the statute book provides that convicts
                shall work as they ought to work. Shall it be said the State is to support felons in
                laziness or idleness? The amendment proposed by the Senator from Hancock [Mr.
                Yancey] is simply an indirect way to prevent the State from reaping any substantial
                benefit from its convict labor. Dicipline can not be maintained in the prisons
                unless the men can be kept at work. This bill is a bill of abominations and an
                injustice to the people of this State. He moved to refer these two bills to a select
                Committee of Five to see if they can not harmonize these conflicting interests.</p>

              <p> Mr. BUNDY, while not objecting to the reference of these two bills, sated some
                objection to the bill S. 281. While now convicts are employed, this bill proposes to
                keep them in idleness. When the present contracts expire there is no provision in
                this bill for hiring the convicts, but they must remain in idleness. This convict
                labor question is one of the most complex questions that can arise. Who gets the
                benefit of cheapening manufactured articles? It is the laboring men. If that is not
                true, the reform should be in s system of contracts. A young man sent to the
                Penitentiary should be learned a trade if he has none before. Imprisonment at labor
                is a reformatory process. He favored letting contracts at such a price that the
                articles manufactured can not be sold at less than the market price of like articles
                made by free labor. He closed by making an ineffectual motion to adjourn at twenty
                minutes before 6 o'clock.</p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE opposed the motion to refer the bill to a Select Committee and indicated
                an amendment he desired to offer at the proper time to Section 3, authorizing the
                Directors to manufacture in the Prisons any class of goods, not manufactured
                elsewhere in the State. On the score of economy, this sort of provision should be
                established in lieu of the present law. It is our duty to protect free labor and at
                the same time protect the taxpayer of the State, and this amendment will do both. </p>

            <p> In pursuance with the rules of the House it was placed on the table for future

            <p> Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, presented a memorial from Dr. E. E. White, President of
              Purdue University, indicating his purpose to resign and stating reasons for such
              action, being the "rider" placed on the Purdue appropriation bill which should be
              reconsidered in the interest of the University and the ensuing speeches made by
              members on the floor of the Senate. In the course of the letter Professor White
              denounced Greek Societies vigorously, alleging that their tendencies and effect are
              immoral and subversive of good discipline. As the Senate's "rider" to the
              appropriation bill will affect his authority among the students, he announces his
              determination to surrender the position.</p>

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN was in favor of the right by all men to respectful petition, but when a
              memorial comes to this House in such disrespectful language it should not be received.
              He moved that the memorial be respectfully returned to Mr. White. </p>

            <p> Mr. PATTEN desired to say that the author of that memorial is a demagogue of the
              first type, and that the memorial is an insult to this Legislature. It is from a
              demagogue who is so egotistical as to believe that Purdue University would go down
              should he resign.</p>

            <p> Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, had received the memorial and a letter requesting him to
              present the same to the House, which he did in what he considered a proper manner. The
              features of the memorial did not appear so objectionable to him as they did to the
              gentlemen [Mr. Heffren and Mr. Patten] who had just spoken. </p>

            <p> Mr. JEWETT'S first impression was like that of the gentleman from Washington [Mr.
              Heffren]. that this should be returned; but after hearing the memorial read it seemed
              to him that it is respectful in tone, and that the House of Representatives can not

              <p> The special order being bill [H. R. 460] the specific appropriation bill, it was
                taken up.</p>

              <p>Mr. FRAZER moved that the House go into <orgName>Committee of the Whole
                  House</orgName> to consider this bill.</p>

              <p>The motion was agreed to and accordingly the House of Representative resolved
                itself in a <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName> on the state of the
                Commonwealth [Mr. Frazer in the Chair.]</p>

              <p>The Chairman announced the question before the Committee to be the specific
                appropriation bill, and ordered the Clerk to read the bill by items for
                amendment.</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr MERING, the appropriation to Theo. A. Hough, administratrix of the
                estate Daniel Hough, deceased, was raised from $1,000 to $1,120.</p>

              <p>Pending the vote on the adoption of the amendment, Mr MERING staled that the
                Legislature two years ago by joint resolution authorized the purchase of this
                library, but the specific appropriation bill failed to pass the Senate, and
                consequently this money was not paid at that time.</p>

              <p>Mr WILSON, of Marion, thought that in granting this appropriation the State would
                simply be doing justice to private individuals.</p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT moved to amend by striking out item 4, being the claim of F. A. W.
                Davis. assignee of a claim of Mr. Reiley, former Treasurer of Marion County, for the
                sum of $579.75. </p>

              <p>Mr, JEWETT thought it might be possible that the gentleman was entitled to the
                amount claimed, but was of the opinion that he should not have allowed the claim to
                lie until the limitation of the statute passed.</p>

              <p> Mr. WILSON, of Marion, was in favor of allowing the claim. The Supreme Court had
                decided in favor of this gentleman, and it comes with poor grace for any
                Representative to oppose it The State of Indiana can not afford not to pay this
                claim. He was in favor of paying it and paying it with interest. </p>

              <p>Mr. PATTEN was in favor of letting the Supreme Court take care of itself, and the
                Legislature doing the same thing. </p>

              <p>Mr. SHIVELY thought that it was but just and equitable that this money, which is
                now in the Treasury of the State, and which rightfully belongs to this man, should
                be paid over to him.</p>

              <p>Mr. STEWART thought that in the face of the decision of the Supreme-Court, this
                claim was a just one.</p>

              <p>The claim was rejected upon a division affirmative. 50; negative, 31. </p>

              <p>Mr. SCHLOSS moved to strike out the sixth item-being the claim of Baker, Smith
                &amp; Co.</p>

              <p>Mr. ADAMS had investigated this claim thoroughly, and felt in duty bound to say a
                few words to regard to it. As a member of the House he could not favor any claim
                unless he believed it was honestly due. After a careful examination of the facts he
                was satisfied this was a just claim, and one which should be allowed by the
                Legislature. </p>

              <p>Mr. Schloss' motion to strike out the claim was agreed to. </p>

              <p>Mr. PATTEN moved to strike out item seven being the claim of Simon Thompson for
                services rendered the State in the Newton Circuit Court. </p>

              <p>Mr. GILMAN could not understand why the gentleman made the motion to strike out the
                claim. The claim was originally for $1,000 for services rendered to the State, and
                in Newton County for certain property. This gentleman was Prosecuting Attorney for
                that County at the time, and he became satisfied that this property under question
                was rightfully the properly of the State, He entered suit for the State and followed
                the matter to the Supreme Court, where finally the suit terminated in favor of the
                State, and the State is now holding property valued at $5,000 as the result of this
                claimant. He earnestly advocated the granting of the claim as one every way just. </p>

              <p>Mr. PATTEN thought it was bad policy for the State to attempt to pay all attorneys'
                fees in the State. He was not in favor of granting the claim.</p>

              <p>Mr. MOODY favored the allowance of the claim </p>

              <p>Mr. SHIVELY understood that the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName> had
                unanimously recommended the allowance of the claim.</p>

              <p>An amendment by Mr. GIBSON to make the claim $500 and allow the same, provided the
                claimant would give a receipt it full for all services, was adopted, after an
                ineffectual motion by Mr. SCHLOSS to lay the same on the table. </p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. WILSON of Marion, the Committee rose, reported progress and asked
                leave to sit again to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.</p>

          <p> On motion by Mr. BROWN a Committee of Two-Messrs. Brown and Spann-were appointed to
            inform the House that Mr. Kelley is Principal Secretary of the Senate. </p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">CONTRACT CONVICT LABOR.</head>

            <p> On motion by Mr. CAMPBELL the Senate resumed the consideration of the convict
              contract labor bills, pending at the time of the election of Principal Secretary of
              the Senate last night the auction being on the motion to refer to a Select
              Committee.</p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL opposed the motion, as no serious objection has been made to the bill S.
              147. This bill provides a remedy for the contract- lopping proceps, it also prohibits
              the employment of convicts outside of the Prison walls, etc. [See page 167 of the
              Brevier Reports.] The bill was been submitted to the scrutiny of some of the best
              lawyers on this floor and received their approval. The detriment comes to the laboring
              classes because of the low price convict labor products, are thrown upon the market,
              in order to meet which the free laborer must reduce his price. As soon as a brand of
              Cain is put upon Prison products it reduces the price, and can possibly have no other
              effect. The object of the bill is to enhance the values of convict labor productions. </p>

            <p>Mr. HILL inquired whether these amendments were not intended to depreciate the price
              of articles manufactured by convict labor.</p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL could not answer for the motives of the movers of the amendments. He
              opposed establishing a fixed per diem for convict labor, because there are strong men
              and weak, decrepit and maimed, and a uniform price can not be made to work well. </p>

            <p>Mr. HOOVER suggested there were but a small number of the latter classes. </p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL: Then the minimum price would be made to apply to such. He believed in
              an open competition in the Interest of the laboring men and taxpayers of the State,
              and it is only for such legislation should be had. He opposed creating an aristocracy
              in the Prisons, and feeding such at the expense of honest taxpayers of the State. </p>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON agreed with the Senator that the objects of the bills will be defeated by
              a reference to a Committee. At least 25,000 voting petitioners have come here praying
              for the abolishment of contract convict labor. If new provisions are to be introduced
              into the present system, they will be evaded and disregarded, as the present
              provisions have been. The system is pernicious, and ought lobe abolished as proposed
              by the bill [S. 281]. which will do for the State what the protective tariff is doing
              for the country at large. The National Government finds a protective tariff necessary
              to he interests of home manufactures. This bill proposes a like tax upon the people of
              Indiana in the interest of our own manufacturers and laboring men. An amendment made
              to the bill yesterday authorizes the employment of convict labor within the walls in
              the manufacture of articles not made in the State else where. He bad himself favored
              this plan in the Committee. </p>

            <p>Mr. McCLURE, residing in the vicinity of the Prison South, said: Nearly every session
              there are moral and political philosophers proposing improvements in the management of
              our Prisons. When he first heard these bills read he was ready to vote against them,
              because they are both impracticable. Look at their contradictions in terms. The object
              of branding Prison-made goods is clearly to depreciate their market value, which
              should not be done, because if done, contractors can not afford to hire convicts at a
              fixed minimum price for such labor above what they would be able to give. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN moved to add to the bill [S. 241] a clause that its provisions shall not
              apply to any existing convict labor contract. </p>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE offered the substitue he explained last night, to go, with the other
              proposed amendments, to the Committee. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN regarded it as apparent these bills should go to the Committee. The bill
              [S. 281] proceeds upon the idea there is no labor to be performed by convicts except
              on a Prison farm. The Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke] comes in with a proposition for
              the manufacture of articles not now manufactured in the State. He condemned the bill
              as the worst piece of legislation yet brought to the Bar of the Senate, and it
                legisla<pb n="250" xml:id="VAA8558-21-249"/>tion on this subject is needed, he
              believed the Committee would bring in a bill. In answer to the query Mr. Brown said
              there is serious doubt as to whether legislation on the subject is needed. Before the
              investigation o the contract system these Prisons had to be maintained by the State,
              but since then the Prisons are self sustaining.</p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN would not remain quiet under an imputation that vicious measures came from
              his side of the Chamber only, but repelled such statements. </p>

            <p>Mr. HILLIGASS disliked to see every discussion worked into a political harangue. He
              proceeded to show there is a little vicions legislation in Section 3 of the bill S.
              281, which will be an open bid in every County for changes of venue. The laboring men
              and farmers are not willing to pay for the maintenance of convicts in the Penitentiary
              in idleness. This bill will lay down the bars for those who committ petit larcenies to
              go acquit. He favored the motion to refer it to a select Committee, and demanded the
              previous question on that motion.</p>

            <p> The demand for the previous question was seconded by the Senate-yeas, 24; nays,
              20.</p>

            <p> So, under the operations of the previous question, the motion to refer was rejected

              <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS: Much has been said in the last week or two about vicious
                legislation, but of all the hills that have been introduced into this or the other
                branch of the General Assembly, this is by far the most mischievous. It affects no
                city in the State except the city of Indianapolis, and he could not sit still
                without attempting to show up some of its vicious provisions. It will cost the city
                $50,000 a year more to manage the affairs than heretofore. It is directly in the
                interest of a few Ward politicians of the city, who among Democrats themselves, do
                not occupy a position of even ordinary respectability. It has passed the House and
                advanced so far in this Senate without the knowledge, on the part of many members
                who have voters for it, as to what its real purposes are. He had sufficient
                confidence in the fairness of many Senators on this floor to believe that if they
                knew its vicious provisions they would not support it. As for a meeting of the
                  <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, really none was had on this bill. It
                waited for no consultation with the minority. A majority of the members said they
                were determined to recommend the passage of the bill and the Committee adjourned,
                and that is all the consideration this bill ever had in the <orgName>Judiciary
                  Committee</orgName> It is an open secret that the Senator from Allen and Whitley
                [Mr. Bell] is opposed to the principle of this bill-that its provisions are in
                violation of the fundamental principles of self-government, yet as the purchase
                price for the immunity of his own city [Fort Wayne] he is ready to vote to fasten
                the principles of it upon the city of Indianapolis. There are facts known to many
                Senators on this floor-is that the principle upon which legislation is to pass
                through this General Assembly. He was astonished that his colleague [Mr. Fletcher]
                allowed himself to be controlled by the troops of fellows which have been thronging
                this lobby in the interest of this bill. He asked Senators to vote according to
                their convictions of what is right and what is just. It was with the greatest
                difficulty he could keep his patience and keep within bounds of what is
                parliamentary in not using language that might be offensive to Senators who favor
                this bill, His opposition was not entirely upon the idea that the bill is wrong in
                principle; for were the principle right, the bill is of such a character that it
                ought not to have a standing in this Senate one minute. It proposes to deprive the
                city of Indianapolis of self-government by putting its government in the hands or
                three Democratic State officers, manifestly for the purpose of controlling the
                politics of the city through the police. In all fair dealing the city should have
                some right to protect itself. As a Republican representative on this proposed Police
                Board not one man has been <pb n="251" xml:id="VAA8558-21-250"/> mentioned who
                stands in a position (as he declared before was the case with the proposed
                Democratic representatives on this Board) or who occupies a position of even
                ordinary respectability in the Republican party. We would like to have some say as
                to who shall represent the Republican party on this Board. We don't want a drunken
                ex-Councilman or man who was at one time connected with the police force and who
                himself had to be carried home by his own patrolmen. Such names have been presented
                to represent the Republican party on this Board; no better have been, and it is
                doubtful if any better will be presented. Nor did he believe it was the intention to
                give any better Democratic representation on the Board Those who have been pushing
                the bill-who have hung around the lobbies of the Legislature and the corridors of
                the hotels, till midnight frequently, have not always kept. themselves in such a
                condition that their tongues were under proper control, and in their maudlin,
                drunken talk we have got into the merits of Their in ten lions and designs. If there
                has been a respectable Democrat-respectable in his own party or recognized as
                respectable among Democrats-who has been furthering the interests of this bill, he
                has kept himself in the background, and put forward those willing to do the dirty
                work necessary to secure the passage of this bill. bill. He appealed to Senators if
                they intended to persist in forcing this measure he would assist in perfecting it so
                it would give the city something that will prevent its being robbed without let or
                hindrance. There is some honor and some principle left in the gentlemen who
                represent the Democratic party on this floor, and he spoke with the hope of calling
                their attention to the unjust, unfair and vicious features in this bill, and the
                purposes which lie behind it. He would like to address himself to those Senators,
                but they are gone, their seats are vacant. He predicted that no Representative
                Republican would ever obtain a position on this Police Board, but that the position
                would be given to some milk and water Republican, and every thing would be left
                entirely in the control of Democrats. That will be about the size of this matter.
                The Constitutional question as against this bill is a well founded objection. He
                felt sure the people would not tamely submit to have this bill thrust upon them.
                Such legislation can out be reconciled with the provisions of the Constitution. When
                he concluded-at fifteen minutes past 5 o'clock-</p>

              <p>Mr. FLETCHER hardly thought it necessary to argue the question further. Expressing
                confidence in the report, of the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, who have
                examined into the legality of the bill, and believing himself quite familiar with
                the feeling of the people of Indianapolis, he ventured to speak a few minutes. His
                colleague [Mr. Van Vorhis] has acknowledged almost, all that could be asked as to
                the condition of the police force of this city at this time, and what it, has been
                for several years, when he said that a member of the Police Board has been
                constantly carried home drunk by his patrolmen-a business they were engaged in a
                great deal of the time. And his colleague has denounced the present Chairman of the
                Police Board as a public drunkard. It is known to everybody in Indianapolis that we
                have not had a fair election in years-I may say from the time I saw troops marched
                from the Governor's Circle to the place where we now are, and I saw them with my own
                eyes voted by the Republican party, they not being citizens of this State, but
                soldiers: and from that day I have never seen an honest, fair and open election in
                this city. [Applause and yells of approval from the gallery.]</p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN, as a question of privilege, moved that the galleries be cleared, as
                there seems to be a Democratic mob there.</p>

              <p> Mr. BELL hoped the belt will not get off-that the motion will not be pressed. </p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS called attention to the fact that no such outburst occurred during
                all the time he was speaking.</p>

              <p>The PRESIDENT pro tem. [Mr. Bundy in the Chair]: If it occurs again there will be
                no motion necessary to clear the galleries.</p>

              <p> Mr. FLETCHER (resuming) was not a lawyer and not accustomed to public speaking,
                but believed in the efficiency of concentrated remedies and would get this down to
                as floe a point as possible. By this bill Governor Porter is made a member of the
                Police Board, who voted for a bill precisely similar to this in Washington, and
                believed it was a very good thing at that time. No doubt his influence upon the
                Board would be better than if there was no Republican upon it at all. In discussing
                this question he was not acting at all in a partisan manner, or in voting for this
                bill as he should outside of the pot-house politicians, both Republicans and
                Democrats, I have not seen any great manifestation of strength regarding this bill
                in public. A few wealthy men, who are heavy taxpayers, have said to me: "I want you
                to support that bill. because I believe under the present system our property, as
                well as all that pertains to the city, is not safe in the hands of the present
                management." And I find on speaking with men who hold small properties that when I
                explain to them the points in a bill of this kind and how it should be administered,
                that they are almost to a man in favor of it. It is only the extreme partisan that
                speaks strongly either for or against it. I think the partisans on both sides of the
                Senate should agree to this bill, for if what the Senator says is true, an outrage
                is perpetrated by it, it will certainly become so distasteful to the people that it
                will aid his side of the House in carrying the next election in this city. </p>

              <p>Mr VAN VORHIS (interposing): We don't want to pay $50,000 for that; we can do it
                without.</p>

              <p>Mr. FLETCHER: I don't wish to discuss that, but I have examined the city government
                in a political character and it is one mass of political gangrene and corruption,
                and it will be managed in the interest of extreme partisans, and not in the interest
                of the citizens generally. It is as foul, stinking, diseased mass of political
                corruption as has ever been concocted, and as a physician I would recommend a
                remedy, not asking what the remedy will cost. The citizens of Indianapolis are
                willing to take the remedy, and that is that we should concur with the majority
                report of the Committee and pass this bill. Therefore I move the previous question. </p>

              <p>The demand for the previous question was sectioned-yeas, 22; nays, 14. The minority
                report was rejected-yeas, 15; nays, 22-and the majority report was concurred in by

              the specific appropriation bill [Mr. Frazer in the chair]. </p>

            <p>Mr. CHITTENDEN moved to strike out item 8 of the appropriation bill-being the claim
              of John Martin for work and material furnished in the erection of the Insane Hospital
              at Indianapolis, for the sum of $46,736.40. </p>

            <p>By consent a majority and minority report from the <orgName>Committee on
                Claims</orgName>, the former recommending the allowance, and the latter recommending
              the rejection of the claim, were read. </p>

            <p>Mr. ADAMS believed this is a question which ought to be considered by the members cf
              the Legislature. He did not desire any claim or item 'Allowed that was not justly due.
              He believed it WAS just as much the duty of members to pay these claims which the
              State honestly owes, as it was for him to pay his private individual debts. The
              Legislature ft few years ago, In 1875 he believed, decided the building of this new
              Asylum. The properly appointed Board of Commissioners advertised for contracts, and
              Porter came and contracted for this work: according to the specifications laid down by
              the architect. This contract provides that the work shall be done and after it is
              completed that it shall be measured according to mason's measurement. The bids were
              received upon the principle that that measurement be adopted, and after that was done
              these men refused to make the measurement. With the majority of the <orgName>Committee
                on Claims</orgName> he recommended that this claims be allowed. He believed this
              amount to be $20,000 less than is really due Mr. Martin. He believed as citizens of
              Indiana, as Representatives of this people, if we do not allow this claim we will be
              doing a great injustice to a citizen of the State of Indiana. In answer to a question,
              he answered that Mr. Martin had agreed with the Provisional Board to receipt for the
              claim in full provided the Legislature allowed him $45,000. </p>

            <p>Mr, GIBSON stated that this claim was before the Legislature two years ago. It was
              looked upon with a good deal of disfavor then, and he thought it was looked upon with
              a great deal more disfavor now. He understood that after the contract was drawn by the
              Provisional Board, the word "mason's measurement" was inserted between the lines, and
              was not a part of the original contract. During the life time of Mr. May, the
              architect of this building, nothing was heard of Mr. Martin's claim, but after Mr.
              May's death and a new architect was appointed, this gentleman comes in and demands a
              new measurment. He was obliged to say that he believed this claim should not be
              allowed.</p>

            <p>Mr. McCORMICK, as one of the Committee who investigated this question, desired to say
              that he would vote for every claim that he believed to be lust and that the State
              should pay. We find that the Provisional Board employed a man to come from Georgia to
              make a measurement of' the number of brick in the Insane Asylum. This measurement,
              made the number of brick twenty-three million and some thousands. According to this
              gentle man's measurement the State has overpaid Mr. Martin some ten thousand and more
              dollars. Dr. Jamison was before our Committee, and he said that Mr. Martin was paid
              more money by the State than was due him, and he [Mr. Jamison] was a member of the
              Board at that time. Mr. McCormick did not believe that the Stale owed Mr- Martin one
              dollar, and that the State had paid him more money than he was entitled to, and that
              the claim is unjust and should not be allowed. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELY, like other gentlemen on the floor, did not desire, and he hoped that no
              unjust claim would be allowed by this House- But he did hope that, in their extreme
              desire to protect the State, they would not reject any claims that ought rightfully to
              pass. He had taken some little time to investigate the claim of Mr. Martin. He was not
              personally acquainted with Mr. Martin, but he 5mew that he was a citizen of this
              State, and that, he was a mechanic, and he further knew that he was a Democrat. He
              understood from his neighbor that Mr. Martin is an honest man. Here is a written
              contract signed by John Martin on the one hand and the State's Provisional Board on
              the other, in which Martin agrees to do certain work. This work was done in pursuance
              of the provisions of the contract, and the question now is what construction will you
              place upon certain words of the contract? It provides that the work, shall be done,
              Had that it shall be measured ac^ cording to mason's measurement. Now, then, the
              question comes to this House, how will you construe these words "mason's measurement?"
              We find that this Provisional Board, who were authorized to draw warrants for the
              construction of this building, did draw warrants in favor of John Martin tor the
              performance of this work in 1881 this Board issued to John Martin a warrant for
              forty-six thousand and some hundred dollars, which warrant Mr. Martin possesses
              to-day. These warrants were drawn in pursuance of the statute authorizing this
              Provisional Board to draw warrants. [Mr. Shively read the Statute giving the Board the
              power to issue warrants.]. He hoped that for the good name of the State of Indiana
              that this just claim would no longer late, denied or refused. Men who have devoted
              their time and their labor to the State should have their just remuneration. You must
              remember, if the claim is large, that the contract was large. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, was at the beginning of the session favorably impressed with
              the John Martin claim, especially when the Governor: spoke of this man and his claim
              in a manner that brought cheers from the gallery and tears from the members of the
              House. But he believed was an open fact that this claim did not belong to John Martin,
              but that it belonged to the lobbyists on the floor of the House and to a large banking
              company in this city. He desired to state in regard to the number of brick in the
              building that according to the first measurement made by Mr. Worden, the gentleman
              whom the Provision Board employed to take the measurement, to the number of brick was
              23,000,000, and that his second measurement he made it several millions more. When
              this gentleman was question concerning the difference in the estimate of the two
              measurements, he said be was a friend of Mr. Martin's and had not come there to do him
              an injury.</p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN wanted to say in reference to claim, and he got his information from
              gentlemen who were here before, that this claim come limping into this House on
              crutches. He deal to state that the contract brought into this House is not the
              original contract between John Martin and the Provisional Board, and that the words
              "mason's measurement" were not in the original contract but were Inserted between the
              lines after the original contract was made. He was satisfied that John Martin knew
              that he had received every dollar that was due him, and not only that by that he had
              received some $10,000 more than was justly due him. Whenever any claim is presented by
              the lobbyists as this claim has been you feel sure something is wrong about it. In
              speaking of ex-Governor Williams' connection with the claim, Mr. Patten was of the
              opinion that if Gov<pb n="253" xml:id="VAA8558-21-252"/>ernor Williams was alive and
              here to-day he would oppose this claim as he oiA up to the day of his death.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. PATTEN the Committee rose, reported progress and asked leave to sit
              again at 2 o'clock. </p>

            <p>The report of the <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName> was concurred in by the
              House. </p>

            <head rend="center">PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.</head>

            <p> Mr. WILEY called for the special order, being the several resolutions agreeing to
              the amendments proposed to the Constitution of the State by the last General Assembly. </p>

            <p>The joint resolution proposing an amendment to Section 2, Article 2, of the
              Constitution of the State of Indiana and amending Section'2 of Article 2 thereof, so
              that it will read as follows: </p>

            <p>Sec. 2 In all elections not otherwise provided for by this Constitution every citizen
              of the United States of the age of twenty-one years and upwards, who shall have
              resided in the State during the six months, and in the Township sixty days, and in the
              Ward or Precinct thirty days Immediately preceding such election, and every person of
              foreign birth of the age of twenty-one years and upwards who shall have resided in the
              United States one year and who shall have resided in the State during the six months,
              and in the Township sixty days and in the Ward or Precinct thirty days immediately
              preceding such election, and shall have declared his or her intention to become a
              citizen of the United States, conformably to the laws of the United States on the
              subject of naturalization, shall be entitled to vote in the Township, Ward or Precinct
              where he or she may reside, If he or she shall have been duly registered according to
              law, was read the third time. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT trusted that the House would bear with him only a few minutes. He thought
              that the members would remember that during the protracted argument which took place
              on the amendments he held his peace. It is also well known that he is one of the
              minority of the Democrats in this Chamber, respectful in number at least, who have
              from the first pursued a course which they believed would bring these amendments
              directly before the people. He would vote against this amendment at the polls,
              believing that 98 per cent. of the women of the State did not desire this privilege.
              Concerning the amendment in relation to the election of State and County officers he
              stated that he believed ministerial and judicial officers should be elected as
              frequently as would be consistent with the duties of the offices. The prohibitory
              amendment he was opposed to on principle, and in every way that is honorable and fair
              he would oppose this amendment. He did not question the right of the majority of the
              people to place this amendment in the Constitution if they desired to do so. </p>

            <p>Mr MONTGOMERY had come into the Legislature unpledged to his people He did not pledge
              himself or tell his people that he would vote for or against this amendment. He told
              them that he was opposed to what was known as the prohibitory amendment, and also to
              the woman suffrage amendment, and that he was in favor of the other amendments. Two of
              the amendments he would cheerfully vote for, and two of the amendments he would
              heartily oppose. But he would so cast his vote on these resolutions that his
              constituents would have the privilege of voting their sentiments on this question. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN moved the previous question which was seconded by the House, and under its
              operations the resolution passed, the House by yeas, 51; nays, 40-as follows:</p>

          <p>Mr. HENRY stated objections to this amendment-it would open up every ditch proceeding

            <head rend="center">THE STATE'S TREASURE.</head>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY read the following, and moved for a suspension of the order of business
              and its adoption:</p>

            <p> Whereas, The ex-State Treasurer who retired from office on the 37th of February was
              responsible to the State for about $700,000, which by law was required to be kept in
              the Treasury of the State and turned over to his successor in office in lawful money;
              and </p>

            <p>Whereas, The said funds of the State of Indiana were not turned over to the present
              Treasurer of the State of Indiana in cash but in certificates and checks, and are not
              now in the vaults of the Treasury, but are loaned by the present Treasurer of State to
              certain banks of the city of Indianapolis; and</p>

            <p>Whereas, By law the loaning of said funds by the Treasurer or keeping them elsewhere
              than in the vaults of the Treasury is a misdemeanor, and the funds of the State are in
              danger of being lost, as the bond of the Treasurer of State is only $150,000, while
              the funds for which he is accountable at this time amount to more than four times that
              1 gum; and Whereas, The fact that said funds not being in the Treasury, as required by
              law, amounts to a defalcation which requires imediate action to protect the Treasury;
              therefore; </p>

            <p>Resolved, That a Committee of three Democrats and two Republicans be appointed by the
              President of the Senate with power to examine witnesses to investigate the Treasury of
              the State count the funds found therein, and what deficiency exists, if any, as shown
              by the books of the Auditor of State, and report what steps are necessary to protect
              the public funds as required by law.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY offered this resolution for the purpose of protecting the State Treasury of
              Indiana. In the Treasury is $700,000, and suppose all that money is lost lo-morrow.
              what protection has the people of Indiana but the Treasurer'" bond for $150,000? He
              was informed and believed that this money is in banks and other places, instead of
              being in the vaults of the State where it be longs, and that the State Treasurer is
              loaning it at 4 per cent., and receiving the interest on it. </p>

            <p>Mr. BELL (interposing) would be glad to know where the vaults of the treasury are
              located. There is an old safe in the State Treasurer's office which cost about
              $200.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY (resuming): There is a statute providing for the safe keeping of the moneys
              of of the State, and establishing a vault for that purpose, and to keep it any place
              else is a violation of law. He hoped the resolution would not be taken in a partisan
              sense. </p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE (interrupting) inquired if this thing has not existed for a year or two,
              and if the Senator had not been cognizant of the fact. </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY (continuing): Did not ascertain until to-day that this money is loaned out
              in this way.</p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE (in his seat): You knew it in a general way. [Laughter ] </p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY (continuing): Whatever he knew on the subject, it is not possible now, by
              bringing up the fact that it has existed for two years, to make it right This
              Legislature is about to close its session, and something should be done to protect the
              State Treasury from the possible loss of half a million dollars. The fact that no
              member on the other side has introduced a resolution for the purpose of protecting the
              public funds is no argument why it should not be done now. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH (interrupting) asked why the Senator did not introduce the resolution in
              the early part of the session.</p>

            <p>Mr. BUNDY (resuming) had already stated he did not know until to-day that this money
              was loaned out at a specific rate of interest, and was not in the Treasury vaults. He
              asked if the Senator from Jay has known it? </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH (in his seat): I don"t yet. </p>

            <p>Mr. MAGEE said the Senator ought to know that to make this examination thorough so as
              to acquaint this Senate with any facts that might come into its possession would take
              Committee a month or six weeks, so the pure motives of the author of this resolution
              should have been stirred up much earlier in the session. Admitting that $700,000 is, a
              good deal of money, and that $150,000 is not a sufficient bond for the officer having
              it in charge, yet to the credit of every Treasurer this State has had no one, either
              Democratic or Republican, has failed to account for every dollar of the public fun'-is
              that has come into his hands. He would join with the Senator in an investigation if
              there has been any wrong done on the part of any Treasurer, or if the public funds are
              not on hand and he thought the majority on this floor would aid in an investigation as
              soon as needed. If the Treasurer of State gets interest on the public funds that is a
              matter between himself and the people who pay the interest. Every officer in the State
              having charge of fiduciary funds does the same thing, and as he understands, the
              Supreme Court says they have the right to do it He opposed the resolution because he
              did not believe it was offered in good faith and he did not propose to give a vote
              that will cast reflection upon the conduct of an officer who has not had time to
              commit any wrong. He counseled Senators to sit down on this proposed investigation
              coming in at the heels of the session and for no other purpose than that gentlemen on
              the other side may go to their constituency and say that a Democratic Senate refused
              to investigate a Democratic officer for loaning the public funds, when at the same
              time every Republican official receives interest on public money. </p>

            <p>Mr. BROWN also opposed the resolution. The Senator who offers it insists that the
              Treasurer of State shall keep $700,000 in the State's safe or vault, as he calls it,
              which the Senator from Allen and Whitley, who knows all about it, says is an old
              dilapidated safe which originally cost only $250.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES declared that in the absence of the statute to the contrary the Treasurer
              of State has the right to loan the public moneys and make a profit on it, and nobody
              can say him "nay." </p>

            <p>The motion to suspend the order of business was rejected by yeas 7; nays, 25. </p>

            <p>Pending the roll-call-</p>

            <p>Mr. McMAGEE, when his name was called, said: Following the authority as laid down in
              the case of the State on relation of the Attorney General against Nathan Kimball,
              formerly a State Treasurer, I vote "no." </p>

            <p>Mr. RAHM, when his came was called, said; I voted twice against suspending the rules
              in order that the special order may be taken up, and I will vote against it again. But
              I will vote for this resolution whenever it comes up at the proper time. I don't care
              if Governor Porter is a stockholder of the bank that borrows the State's money, any
              bank that will pay 4 per cent. on deposits is bound to break. I don't believe in
              depositing this money at 4 per cent.; better take 2 or 3 per cent., then the bank can
              live and the people' money be safe. I don't believe in putting the State's money in a
              safe that cost but $250; because it would be stolen in six months. I vote "no." </p>

            <p>Mr. SPANN, when his name was called, said: We have heard recently from the States of
              Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi on the question of State Treasurers, and now having
              a Democrat in that office In this State, and knowing the uncertainty of confidence to
              be placed in them in the light of that history, and knowing the statute on the subject
              of loaning this money, I vote "aye." </p>

            <pb n="257" xml:id="VAA8558-21-256"/>

            <p>The result of the vote was then announced, so the motion was rejected. </p>

            <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special order being Mr. Campbell's bill [S.
              101] and Mr. McCollough's bill [S. 19] defining unjust discriminations of
              railroads-see page 239 of the Brevier Reports-the question being on a Committee
              report, recommending that the bill [S. 19] lie on the table</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL hoped the report of the Committee will be concurred in and thus the bill be
              laid on the table. The purpose of the bill is good enough, and if it, would accomplish
              that it should have his hearty support. The evils aimed ought to be controlled and
              prevented. The vice lies in the second section of the bill, which rests upon an
              assumption which is not true. It will not do to assume it is unjust to charge more for
              carrying a less distance than a greater. If this bill were to become a law it would
              deprive competing points of the benefit of competition, as he proceeded to illustrate.
              To stop and start an ordinary freight, train of say twenty cars on an ordinary grade
              costs from $1 to $3. Distance is not the main element to take into consideration when
              computing proper rate of charges.</p>

            <p>Mr. FAULKNER cited unjust, discriminations by railroads as against the town in which
              he lived.</p>

            <p>Mr. BELL: Such action is wrong and ought to be stopped; but for a few abuses he would
              not enact a law that would seriously affect places where there is competition. It
              would be unwise, injurious and injudicious to pass this bill. To a certain extent, a
              railroad ought to be under the control of the Legislature. What is set forth in the
              bill should not be considered as unjust discrimination; it would deprive people at
              competing points of an advantage. The policy of the State should be to encourage
              competition. There are very objectionable features in this bill. You affect
              injuriously the railroads of this country and you affect the very heart of business.
              This bill would injuriously affect the interest of thousands where it would advance
              the interests of one. </p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL: It has been stated that an Indiana Assembly has neither brains nor
              integrity enough to enact railroad legislation He believed the contrary to be true. It
              is a question of great magnitude, and one which demands specific legislation. A
              Railroad Company can transport ten car loads at a less rate per car than it can
              transport one, and the price may be based on cost and not go beyond what is equitable.
              If he received one car load and another ten cars the Company may make a difference as
              to Ac ex^ct cost, or percentage of cost. Mr. C. gave way for a motion to adjourn. </p>

            <p>The bill [S. 172] supplemental to an act fixing fees of certain officers, etc.-see
              page 120 of the Brevier Reports. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN offered an amendment providing fee for Clerk's attendance, which, on his
              further motion was considered engrossed, and the bill read the third time and that the
              Constitutional rule be suspend so as to put it on its passage. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY: I heartily indorse the statement of the gentleman from Washington [Mr.
              Heffren], that some bill should be passed on this subject, but I go farther and say
              that a bill should be passed by this Legislature that will in fact, and not merely in
              fiction, cut off constructive fees. This bill, known as the Bayless bill, is a tub
              thrown to the whale, and is expected to quiet the people in their demands for a
              reduction of the fees of County officers The gentleman from Washington says he is
              satisfied that this bill is the only bill hat can pass this Legislature. I do not know
              by what authority members insist that this Legislature must accept this bill or
              nothing. The House <orgName>Committee on Fee and Salaries</orgName> have carefully
              considered House bill 316, and have been ready to report it back to the House for some
              time, and I am desirous to see the House pass this bill prepared as it has been by the
              Committee, and let the responsibility of its failure rest with the Senate. I trust the
              Constitutional rule will not be suspended for the purpose of passing this sham at the
              expense of all bills before the House on this question. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN was in favor of suspending the rules. He was in favor of the other bill
              but if he could not get the other bill he thought it would be best to take this one. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, hoped that the Constitutional rules would not be suspended. He
              had examined both bills, and he believed the bill [H. R. 316] now in the hands of the
              Committee and ready to be reported was much better and wiser legislation. He did not
              believe and could not understand why some gentlemen state that no fee and salary bill
              could be passed by the Legislature. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOCK was fully satisfied that no fee and salary bill could be passed. He was in
              favor of suspending the rules and passing this bill. </p>

            <head rend="center">NEW STATE HOUSE.</head>

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN, from a majority of the <orgName>New State House Investigating
                Committee</orgName>, submitted a report thereon substantially as follows:</p>

            <p>Your Committee finds from the evidence that the prices of material and labor entering
              into the construction of the new State House are now, and have been for some time, at
              least 20 per cent higher than when the contract was awarded.</p>

            <p>We also find that the work has been done in accordance with the plans and
              specifications on file in the Commissioners' office, the material and design being
              unexcelled. </p>

            <p>We also find from the evidence that there have been many changes in the plans and
              specifications found necessary by the Board in the progress of the work that all the
              changes have been made by the Board i'i strict conformity with the contract.</p>

            <p>The evidence further discloses that one William <pb n="258" xml:id="VAA8558-21-257"/>
              B. Howard now owns Kanmacher's interest in the contract, but that he is not recognized
              by the Board as a contractor. The evidence, while very meager upon that subject, would
              seem to Indicate that the contractors, Kanmacher &amp; Denig, are not financially very
              responsible. </p>

            <p>While the evidence of the contractors allowed that they have expended upon the
              building $996,308.98, making an apparent loss of $287,434.10, this apparent lose
              Includes the 10 per cent. retained by the Board, together with all interest upon the
              amounts advanced over and above the amounts received by contractors upon estimates for
              work done, as well as plant, machinery, etc., reducing the total loss of the
              contractors on the building proper to $100,000.</p>

            <p>In view of all the foregoing facts we are of the opinion that the State House can be
              built within the amount allowed by law if completed under the present management of
              Howard &amp; Denig-$2,000,000-but not at the contract; price, $1,762,207.58. We are of
              the opinion, from the evidence, that if the contract is relet to the other contractors
              the building can never be completed within $2,000,000. We believe, further, from the
              evidence, that a reletting to new contractors will retard the completion of the
              building at least one year. We also find that Mr. Kanmacher is a non-resident and
              Insolvent, and that Mr. Denig has little financial ability, and that without pecuniary
              aid he can not complete his contract. We also find that the sureties are non-residents
              of Indiana. We also find by a communication from the Board of State House
              Commissioners that the contractors are desirous to be released from their contract,
              and that the contract be let to Howard &amp; Denig.</p>

            <p>We report resolutions for adoption, and recommend that the House take some action in
              regard to the preservation of the evidence in the case. We also report a bill for the
              consideration of this House. </p>

            <p>The report is signed by Messrs. Heffren, Moody, Shockney and Huston. The bill,
              prepared by the Board of State House Commissioners, which the Committee will submit to
              the Legislature, is supplemental to the existing statute, and provides for the
              reletting of the contract to Howard &amp; Denig, who will be required to give bond in
              a sum not less than $250,000, with ample and acceptable security, and one of the
              bondsmen shall be a resident of Indiana. The reletting of the contract is upon the
              condition that the State House Building shall be tally completed within the time
              specified by law and at a cost not exceeding $2,000,000, which shall include the
              expenditures already made upon work. The bill authorizes the Board of State House
              Commissioners to make the new contract. The resolution referred to provides for the
              payment of the expenses of the investigation. </p>

            <p>Mr. McCORMICK submitted a minority report Betting forth that the entire management
              indicates a disposition to favor the contractors, and aid them in securing from this
              Legislature an additional appropriation; that the work has not been done in accordance
              with the plans and specifications as originally adopted, as many changes have been
              made on account of the incompleteness of the original plans and specifications; and
              that all of said changes have been made at an increased cost to the State in some
              cases three prices were paid. The management of the work team not been economical,
              costing more than was necessary. From the facts deduced from the evidence the
              Committee were of the opinion it was the duty of the contractor to proceed with the
              building according to the contract for the amount specified in the original
              contract.</p>

            <p>These reports were made the special order for 2 o'clock Wednesday. </p>

            <p> Mr. Frazer's bill [H. R. 37] to create the Court of Appeals it provides that the
              Governor shall appoint, to serve until the next general election, five Judges of an
              Appellate Court, one from each Supreme Court District, two of them to be Republicans,
              two Democrats and one National, their salary to be $3,500 a year] was read the third
              time. </p>

            <p>Mr. FRAZER, after reciting the necessities that caused the creation of ^be Supreme
              Court Commission, stated that there could be no doubt that the Commission must be
              continued or an Appellate Court created. The Commission has only reduced the number of
              cases before the Supreme Court 500 in the last two years. He was of the opinion that
              at least one half more business could be dispensed with by the Court, should it be
              created, than by the Supreme Court Commission. The bill strong y advocated itself to
              him as an economical measure and it would in the various ways prove a saving to the
              State of some $11,000 per year. It would also save one-sixth of the time of the
              Supreme Court Judges for under the Commission the Supreme Court Judges expend about
              one-sixth of their time in reviewing the decisions of the Commission, This bill meets
              the approval of the people, and meets the approval of two out of the five Supreme
              Court Commissioners. The passage of the bill was preferable to the continuation of the
              Supreme Court Commission now in existence, for the further reason that the Appellate
              Court would not be subject to the provision of the Constitution, which required a
              written opinion in every case, but would only wire opinions in cases where the
              decisions of lower Courts were reversed. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, thought the bill should not pass. It is too far from the
              people. It is as high in its provinces as the Supreme Court itself. This bill provides
              that in all cases where the amount does not exceed $3,000 it, should go to the Court
              of Appeals. An examination of the matters will reveal the fact that nine-tenths of the
              cases before the Supreme Court do not exceed that amount. Should this bill become a
              law this- would be the only State hi the Union that has two Courts of last resort. He
              hoped that the bill would not pass and that the Commission would continue for two
              years more. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT was of the opinion that that part of the Constitution which says that
              justice must be administered speedily and without delay is not faithfully carried out
              at present. It must be conceded that this bill must pass or the Supreme Court
              Commission must be passed. He knew that he voiced the opinion of the majority of the
              people when he asserts that the Supreme Court Commission has been a failure. It will
              require more money to run the Commission for the next two years than to create the
              Court of Appeals and keep it running for the next two years. He was in favor of giving
              this Court of Appeals a fair test for the next two years.</p>

            <p>Mr. HAM was opposed to the bill. He feared that if this Court of Appeals was created,
              it would, be impossible for the people to get rid of it, even though it proved an
              unsatisfactory experiment. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, believed that the Supreme Court Commissions were becoming more
              unpopular every day. When the Commission was created it was expected that it would
              clean up the docket in two years, but after a trial of two year they were only about
              500 cages from where they were when the Commission was established. We have now
              reached a point where we must continue that Commission or create another Court. This
              Court is indispensible; the people want it: he was in favor of it. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN: I have no right to speak for any constituency but my own. I believe that
              I know their wants, desires and requirements. I know that they are opposed to any
              increase of <pb n="259" xml:id="VAA8558-21-258"/> Courts in this State. I know that at
              every session of the Legislature new propositions for new Courts are proposed, and the
              cry is that the public business requires it. Whenever a new office is proposed there
              is always a horde of persons ready and clamoring for places where they may be fed at
              the expense of the State. I am opposed to this bill because it will not do what its
              supporters contend it will. Let this bill pass and we never will get rid of it. The
              people do not want it. They are already burdened with taxation and demand relief. This
              will make no saving. If the Commission is continued for two years it will expire of
              its own accord. This bill is one to open the doors of the Treasury to feed hungry
              officers at the expense of the people. I hope it will not pass. </p>

            <p>Mr. GORDON was of the opinion that this bill, should it pass, could not afford
              immediate relief. It could not try the 1,000 cases now before the Supreme Court; it
              would only try new cases. In two years more the Commission, at the same rate, will
              have brought up the Supreme Court docket as nearly as it is possible to be done. He
              concurred in the remark previously made that this Court, should it be created, would
              assume nine- tenths of the business of the Supreme Court. </p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON stated that it was a mistake that this Court would get nine-tenths of the
              work of the Supreme Court. This question was carefully considered by the Committee,
              which divided this work so as to give about one-half to the Court of Appeals and
              one-half to the Supreme Court. He was informed that the Supreme Court was against the
              Commission and was in favor of the Court of Appeals. He thought the bill had better
              pass creating this Court.</p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN thought the bill was very fair and very reasonable, and that it would give
              great relief to the people of the State. He felt that the Supreme Court must have some
              relief. This relief must come by the Commission or by the creation of this Court. From
              a financial standpoint he was in favor of the creation of this Court. It would be a
              saving of $500 per year on each Judge. Should this Commission he continued it would
              require six years to clear the docket of the Supreme Court.</p>

            <p>Mr. FRAZER was of the opinion that the opposition came from the Districts where the
              present Commissioners desired a continuance of this Supreme Court Commission that they
              might not lose their positions. He was forced to the conclusion that some members were
              working in the interest of members of this Commission and not in the interest of the
              people If any gentleman would prove to him. that the bill did not save some $11,000 to
              the people each year he would vote against the bill.' </p>

            <p>The bill was rejected by yeas, 37; nays. 50, as follows:</p>

            <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p> The special order being Mr. Ferriter's bill [H. R. 316] concerning legal
              advertisements, it was called up by Mr. Shockney and read the third time. </p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON was opposed to the passage of the bill. He was satisfied that it is
              legislation that the people of Indiana are not demanding. </p>

            <p>Mr. SUTTON thought that because the gentleman from Clarke [Mr. Gibson] had some
              private grievance against some gentleman, was no reason why this bill should not pass.
              He believed that most people read the daily papers and not the weekly papers,
              especially in the cities. He was satisfied that it is a good bill as far as it goes.
              The bill does not seek to increase advertisements. It simply gives the persons most
              interested the privilege of having the advertisement done wherever he desire. There is
              nothing wrong in the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, thought that the gentleman from Clark [Mr. Gibson] labored
              under a misapprehension in regard to the provisions of the bill. It simply provides
              that this advertisement shall be printed in a daily newspaper. It does not say that it
              shall be printed in the Sentinel, Journal, Times or News. It gives the man who has the
              advertisement to do to go to the paper where it can be done cheapest. </p>

            <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 58; nays, 31. </p>

            <p>The SPEAKER announced that in the absence of Principal Clerk Edwins, Emmet L. Rose
              would assume the duties of Principal Clerk. </p>


            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">INDIANAPOLIS CITY TREASURER.</head>

              <p> Mr. WILSON'S, of Marion, bill [H. R. 338] to abolish the office of City Treasurer
                in cities of 60,000 or more inhabitants was read the third time.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILSON stated that the bill is not a political measure. The idea of uniting the
                office of City and County Treasurer emanated from a prominent Republican journal. It
                will save to this city about $100,000. It seeks to have but one assessment, but one
                duplicate, but one time and place of paying tax. It is a matter of economy. There
                have been a half dozen editorials in the Journal and In the Sentinel and one in the
                News asking why this bill has not been passed. He hoped, that the bill would pass
                and become a law.</p>

              <p>Mr. MELLETT was tired of. hearing bill's advocated as good, wholesome measures for
                the city of Indianapolis. He was of the opinion that what was a good, wholesome
                measure for Indianapolis would be a good, wholesome measure for any other city in
                the State. He could not understand' why, in drafting these bills, they were not
                made? to extend to the o'l.aer c'Kies of tine ^tate </p>

              <p>Mr. HEFFREN believed that Indianapolis was the only city that had, through its
                press, businessmen and Board of Trade, demanded such a measure. It is one of the
                measures that the people without distinction of party have asked for. He thought the
                Legislature should grant this request.</p>

              <p>Kr. MOCK thought the bill was right in prince pie, and thought the House should
                accept it and get all the good possible out of it.</p>

              <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 69; nays, 28. </p>

              <head rend="center">STOCK AT LARGE. </head>

              <p>Mr. SHIVELY called up his motion to reconsider the vote by which Mr. Helm's bill
                [H. R. 462] to amend Section 1 of an act to provide for the regulation of stock
                running at large was rejected by the House February 22. </p>

              <p>Mr. SHIVELY stated that in all fairness and justice this hill ought to pass. He was
                at his home, on the Wabash last Saturday and yesterday. He talked with farmers
                living along the Wabash and other streams, and they told him that something must be
                done or they can not farm their ground this year. The argument that the poor man's
                cow should be allowed to run at large should not be considered in this question.
                There are these <pb n="260" xml:id="VAA8558-21-259"/> large farmers with their
                fertile valleys, and unless something is done these men can not farm their lands.
                Their fences are al swept away. </p>

              <p>Mr. McMULLEN hoped the bill would pass. It has been stated that the bill should
                simply apply to the valleys of the Ohio, Wabash and other large streams. Such a law
                would be unconstitutional. We could not make it apply to a single locality or any
                particular localities and make It constitutional. As soon as the cropping season of
                1883 and 1884 are past, the provisions of this bill go out of force, and the present
                law comes into effect again. He knew of a strip of bottom land thirty miles in
                length where not a fence was left. </p>

              <p>Mr. HOLLER said under the present law the line of toe owner of the lauds was
                recognized as his fence, and he was not compelled to enclose his lands with a fence
                to prevent the trespass of stock unless the Commissioners of the County grant the
                privilege of stock running at large. He believed the County Commissioners and
                citizens of any County of the State were more capable of judging whether stock
                should run at large in their Counties or not than the members of this House. He
                thought this bill if passed and recognized fully would work great hardship and
                inconveniences in some Counties. </p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, had made a culculation, and of the 13,000 square miles in
                the State nearly one-thirtieth of this whole area is without fences. He desired to
                place himself on record as being in favor of the passage of this bill.</p>

              <p>Mr. MOCK was from a County that was traversed by the raging Wabash, but he thought
                the Board of Commissioners of his County knew better than himself what the people

            <p> On Motion by Mr. SPANN another vote was taken on the joint resolution [S. 2] to

            <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH, since objecting to this claim the other day, has seen the contract
              between Mr. May and the State House Commissioner, and now has positive evidence that
              this claim is unjust. There is not $3,000 due this widow. He was creditably informed
              that the sons of the deceased are claiming the money as due to them: that they ought
              to have their share in their father's estate. If it is justice to pay $1,000 to the
              widow, it is justice to pay at least $10,000 to each of these children. This is so
              full of injustice to the State that it almost amounts to dishonesty. </p>

            <head rend="center">RAILROAD TARIFF.</head>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL called up a special order, being his bill [S. 10] and Mr. McCullough's
              bill [S. 19] concerning unjust discriminations of railroads-see pages 28 and 239 of
              the Brevier Reports-the question being on a Committee report recommending that the
              bill [S. 19] lie on the table. </p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL insisted railroad discriminations are against, the interests of the
              entire Commonwealth, and it is but right they should be prevented. In some instances
              double tariff is charged for less than 100 miles as is charged for ten times the
              distance. Because of the shortness of time left this session, if anything is done in
              this matter, it should be done quickly. Rail roads are but public servants; they take
              so much of the public land, and they become nuisance in so far as they injure and
              destroy human life. In return for their services they demand what may be considered as
              fees, and there is unquestioned right, as well as a necessity for legislative action
              and control in the interests of the people at large Indiana is behind at least
              fourteen different states in regulating the tariff imposed op the people by railroad
              corporations. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. VOYLES, the House amendments to the road and Supervisor's bill [S.

            <p>Mr. SAYRE thought it incompetent to give due consideration to the many amendments
              proposed to this bill at this time, There is an amendment proposed to Section 20 which
              should not be concurred in. There are some twenty-eight Townships in one of his
              Counties, and it would make a difference of over $20,000 in the State, which would go
              as extra compensation to County Auditors, and be taken from the taxpayers of the
              State. </p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES said the amendment to Section 20 strikes out all in relation to the County
              Auditor.</p>

            <p>Mr. SAYRE insisted that he is right on this question. The Auditor should perform this

              <p> Mr. CAMPBELL resumed his remarks interrupted by the Joint Convention before the
                noon recess. He said: It has been said to my knowledge by high railroad authority in
                the hotel lobbies during the present session that no Indiana Assembly has brains
                enough, or integrity enough, to pass a railroad bill. I confess that my ability as a
                general has been such that with all my efforts and importunities I have but just
                succeeded in getting this bill No. 10 from the hands of the <orgName>Railroad
                  Committee</orgName>. AS to the question of railroad legislation I believe there is
                nothing of more importance to the taxpayers of the State than this and something
                should be done and can be done without in any sense interfering with or trespassing
                upon the legal rights and the equitable rights of the railroads. In the
                consideration of this question we will consider first, the necessity of legislation;
                second, the right to legislate, and third how best to legislate. As to the necessity
                Mr. C. called attention to the unjust discrimination made by which some localities
                and different individuals of the same locality pay unjust and extortionate rates as
                compared with others, How some localities pay a tax upon their products beyond that
                of others, making an unequal taxation. He called attention to the sudden and radical
                changes made in the rates of freight made without notice, often to the great
                detriment of shippers. He cited many cases showing that the rates are often doubled
                without notice. As to the right to legislate he called attention to the fact that
                the railroads are common carriers, public servants, having deeded or leaded to them
                certain privileges, occupying a part of public lands and highways receiving their
                compensation for service rendered by a system of fees not unlike that of the
                Recorder, Clerk, Auditor and other public servants, and that discrimination by
                railroads was as unjust and should be regulated by taxation as much as the other
                public servants and with as much right, that really railroad charges are a system of
                taxation upon the people, and that it is one of the first principles that taxation
                shall be equal, that the same right to regulate charges for interest, practices of
                banks, charges of hackmen, of millers, of toll roads, should also be exercised to
                regulate railroad charges and protect those who patronize them. He also read an
                extract from a letter from Judge Jeremiah S. Black supporting his position in the
                right to legislate. As to how to legislate he preferred his bill [S. 10]-which calls
                for a Commission-rather than the one offered by Senator McCullough [S. 19], as he
                thought a Commission far more practical than specific legislation He believed that
                the Board of Commissioners contemplated in his bill [S. 10] to act, as arbitrators
                bet ween the railroads and the people and between the railroads themselves was the
                practical solution to the problem. He said the railroads needed some power to
                arbitrate between them, and that the cutting of prices at competitive points below a
                fair rate was one great cause of exhorbitant rates at intermediate points lie cited
                several authorities showing where a Commission, the same as the bill contemplated
                hart worked beneficially to both people and the railroad. He closed by saying that
                he believed that a well organized Commission may save to the State of Indiana as
                much as the entire taxes now paid, and yet do no injustice to the railroads.</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN, as a member of the <orgName>Railroad Committee</orgName>, considered
                other bills on the subject far better than the bill S. 19, as it is unjust to the
                railroads, It is not elastic enough-it goes too far against the Corporation. He
                admitted the right of the Legislature to regulate railroads, but it is the duty of
                legislators equally to look to the interests of Corporations as well as peoples.

              <p> There are two sides to this question. He favored a just railroad bill. This bill

              <p>Mr. SPANN resumed his speech on the railroad tariff bill at quarter before 6
                o'clock. He favored regulating the tariff on railroads, but would not refuse such
                corporations a hearing. He favored a law making the rates not only just to the
                shipper, but just to the corporations. The arbitration bill, S. 10, is something
                like what is needed; but the bill S. 19 has not the elasticity requisite-it seems to
                be almost an identical copy of a bill presented last session by Senator Menzies. He

            <p>Mr. HENRY spoke in favor of some legislation upon the proposition presented by both

              favor of the bill S. 10, with some amendments which he indicated.</p>

            <p> At 12:43 a. m. he gave way for a motion to adjourn, which came within one vote of

            <p>On motion by Mr. Heffren, the bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_052">S. 52</ref>] to
              amend Sections 218, 227 and 228 of an act concerning taxation, approved March 29,
              1881, was read the third time.</p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN spoke in favor of the passage of the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, was of the opinion that the men who buy up these lands at tax
              sale are able to examine the title before making such purchases. He thought that the
              advantage should be given to the person whose land is to be sold. </p>

            <p>Mr. ADAMS thought a man should know when he goes into the market to buy land whether
              or not the title is good. He was opposed to a man going into the Treasurer's office or
              the Auditor's office and buying land and then coming to the Legislature and demanding
              the return of his money with interest. He was opposed to the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN did not like the feature of the bill It appeared to be too much in the
              interest of one class. He did not think it was a good bill, and he was afraid of it.
              It looked to him like it was created for the purpose of lifting some man out of a
              difficulty, and therefore he was opposed to it. </p>

            <p>Mr. FRAZER believed that the persons opposing the bill did not understand its
              propositions. </p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELY said It occurred to him that this is a just proposition. The County
              offers land for sale under the provision of the law. Parties come and in good faith
              bid upon this land and purchase it. Now it seemed to him that if these parties pay
              their money over it is but just and fair that they should have the money back if they
              loose the title to this land. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY: Under the present law, if a person buys up land and the title is
              imperfect, there is no way for him to get bis money back. This bill simply asks what
              is fair between the person who buys up this land and the County. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Kosciusko had examined the question and had given home attention to
              the discussion on this bill in the Senate. He desired that the tax law should be as
              perfect as possible. By an examination of the tax law he found that two sections are
              diametrically opposed to each other. He believed that this bill would remedy the
              defect. He was in favor of the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, was reliably informed that this is a good bill and he would
              support it. </p>

            <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 59; nays, 29.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. TULEY, Mr. Huston's bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_230">H. R.
                230</ref>] to legalize the sale of certain real estate in the town of Connersville,
              was read the third time. M</p>

            <p>Mr. HUSTON stated that the State had a suit pending in the Courts at the present time
              for the recovery of the real estate. But he believed this was a just bill and one that
              should pass. He did not believe it was in the interest of the State to take real
              estate from parties who have paid the full value for it. It was represented to these
              parties that he would be perfectly safe in buying this land. He bought the land,
              paying the full value therefor, and he simply asked now to have the State quiet the
              title.</p>

            <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 77; nays, 10. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT, from the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, reported back the
              bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_078">S. 78</ref>] to amend Section 2 of an act to
              provide for the establishment of a State Bureau of Statistics and Geology with the
              recommendation that the bill pass with amendment. The report was concur ed in and the
              amendment wag adopted. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. Jewett the amendment was considered engrossed, the bill was read the
              third time and passed the House by yeas, 66; nays 37. </p>

              <p>Mr. HEFFREN called up his motion to reconsider the vote on bill [<ref

              <p>Mr. Patten made an ineffectual motion-yeas, 21; nay, 51-to lay the motion to
                reconsider on the table. </p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT desired to say a few words before the vote was taken, it was well known
                that when the question was first considered he opposed it, perhaps because he did
                not understand it. Since he cast his vote he had talked with the Superintendent, or
                the Assistant Superintendent, and also with citizens of Irvington, a nourishing
                suburb of Indianapolis, and they all assure him that will be necessary to build the
                wall which the Pan-Handle Company proposed to construct for the protection of the
                Asylum property The wall will be of much more value to the grounds than the strip of
                ground under consideration. The passage of this bill will also prove a source of
                great convenience to the people of Irvington. He was now ready to support the bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. ADAMS, like the gentleman from Clark [Mr. Jewett], opposed the passage of the
                bill when it was before the House before. Since the vote was taken on the bill he
                bad taken some interest and examined the provisions of the bill. He had talked wish
                various persons in regard to the bill, and was now in favor of the bill. </p>

              <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 74: nays, 10. </p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. PATTEN the bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_170">S. 170</ref>] to
                create the Forty-fourth Judicial Circuit, to amend Sections 22 and 23 of an act to

              <head rend="center">METROPOLITAN POLICE BILL.</head>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR directed the reading of the bill [H. R. <unclear
                  reason="faded">13[?]</unclear>] to provide for a metropolitan police force in all
                cities of 29,000 and over inhabitants-see pages 16 and 234 of the Brevier
                Reports-and it was read the third time.</p>

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM resumed the floor to continue his speech commenced at 1:45 o'clock this
                morning. He would yield, however, to any arguments on the other side who had any
                arguments to advance in favor of the bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. RAHM said he would like to speak about fifteen minutes.</p>

              <p>Mr. FLETCHER felt more than ever convinced that this bill is desired by a majority
                of the voters of the city of Indianapolis. He had taken more pains than before to
                make careful inquiry as to the opinion of a majority of the people, and thought the
                bill absolutely fair, and could not see how Senators on the other side could object
                to it. If this bill is going to work wreck and ruin it is certainly for the benefit
                of the Republican I party. The people are willing to take t, they are willing to try
                it, and they are willing to pay for it. What more to say for the bill he didn't
                know. </p>

              <p>Mr. YANCEY listened attentively to what ha just been said and obtained no evidence
                whatever that the bill should pass, unless it be that the Senator has gone around
                inferentially and drummed up certain citizens of this city who are in favor of the
                bill, not from that class of this great city of Indianapolis who pay the taxes of
                the city Government; but representing the bummer class who are al ways terror
                stricken at the sight of a policeman. These are the men who are clamoring for this
                bill-they ought to be on the stone pile of the city. This bill means nothing more
                nor less than the defeat of the Republican party and any Senator honest enough to
                acknowledge the truth will acknowledge that. </p>

              <p>Mr. RAHM did not know whether the people of Indianapolis wanted this bill or not,
                but we down at the town of Evansville do want it-Republicans as well as Democrats,
                and they are not bummers or loafers, but there is a petition here signed by 442 of
                the leading voters and citizens of Evansville, including bankers, wholesale
                merchants, city and County officers. Republicans and Democrats. The Republicans
                don't believe what they say when they say if the bill passes, Marion County will go
                Republican. They know if the bill parses they will have a free fair and square
                election In Marion County, and that is what they are afraid of. He appealed to
                Democratic Senators to vote for this bill, because it will be blamed on us if we
                pass it, and let us get the credit fur it. The Democratic Senator from Marion [Mr.
                Fletcher] says the people of Indianapolis want it, and we ask it, without regard to
                party, for Evansville, where it is wanted to protect the lives and properly of
                citizens without regard to party. </p>

              <p>Mr GRAHAM had already discussed the question, but as, the Senator from Marion [Mr.
                Van Vorhis] has more interest; In this matter than any other Senator, unless it be
                his colleague, he would yield his time to that Senator.</p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS said the parties who are pushing this bill are the very
                off-scourings of the Democratic party, associated with an equally low class
                belonging to the Republican party. Among the best class of the citizens of this city
                nobody wants this bill. The Senator from Vanderburg [Mr. Rahm] says the people down
                there want it but the people of Vanderburg do not know the provisions of this bill
                or they would not want it. It practically opens the City Treasury without limit, let
                or hindrance to the Police Commissioners. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES said: I had not intended to speak to this bill, but since it has been so
                vociferously asserted that, nothing can be said in support of the bill, I have
                concluded to say a word. The Senator from Marion [Mr. Van Vorhis] has gone aside
                from the question, and has made a tirade against individuals in the city who are for
                the bill. I essay to teach the Senator a lesson in logic. I would remind him that
                viturperation is not argument, it is malice. If the Senator can find no arguments,
                and must resort to the abuse of individuals, he is hard pressed in his opposition to
                the bill. The Senator from Hancock [Mr. Yancey] has said that this bill means to fix
                things up in Indianapolis so that the Republican party can not carry the County. So
                we have it. By this we are plainly told that the Republican party holds its majority
                in this city by reason of the odious police force, and I say such a state of facts
                is a shame to the city and it is reprehensible in the greatest degree. The Senator
                from Marion denounces the bill as unconstitutional, yet he does not sate in what
                manner the bill conflicts with any article or section or party of the Constitution.
                It is a singular development when a Senator, who is a good lawyer, declares a bill
                to be unconstitutional without even attempting to justify <pb n="269"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-21-268"/> his declaration by citation of the of the slightest
                conflict. This bill makes a non-partisan police, and no one but the zealous and
                unfair partisan can or will object to its provisions. Republican methods at
                elections in Indianapolis have been such as to outrage every sense of justice and
                fairness. Elections ought to be free and untrammeled, but this principle does not
                apply to the methods In this city. I know what I am saying. It is a part of the
                recent published history of Indianapolis that persons have been slugged and robbed
                on the streets and the police force that is of such great value to the partisan
                interest in which they have been selected. It seems that where life and property is
                unsafe in the city, by reason of the police being engaged in political work to the
                exclusion of their police duties, it is a shame that the legislative powers of
                Indiana are to be defied And proper legislation openly and willfully obstruced by
                the other side of this Chamber, and that human life may continue insecure in the
                night time-in absolute peril after dark-to hold the Republican party in power. It is
                a disgusting spectacle that such a vicious thing must be upheld to sustain any party
                in power. This bill specially makes it impossible for its police to engage at any
                time in partisanship. I am for this bill.-[Time expired.] </p>

              <p>Pending the roll call-</p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY, when his name was called, said i this bill contains that which, in a
                Government like ours is a vicious principle, for it takes away from a people the
                right to govern themselves. This Legislature has no right to determine for the city
                of Indianapolis how that city shall be governed. If this principle can be sustained
                every office not elective by the Constitution of Indiana can be placed in the hands
                of the General Assembly to be filled. The principle can not be defended in reason.
                There can absolutely be no justification for we, representing other districts in the
                State, <choice>
                  <sic>under-undertaking</sic>
                  <corr>undertaking</corr>
                </choice> to say who shall control the offices of the city of Indianapolis and who
                shall take charge of its treasury, who shall expend its monies, and who shall
                control its government. He voted "no." </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE, in explanation of his vote when his name was called, opposed this bill
                because it is thoroughly vicious in principle. The people asking to be protected
                against crime is the proper tribunal to judge what kind of government it shall have.
                The constituency required to pay for the police force is the proper constituency to
                determine how the money is to be expended. If the people of Indianapolis have a bad
                police force they have the power to remove it, and in their hands it ought to be
                left. He voted " no."</p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE, when his name was called, said he did not see that this bill interferes
                with local self-government. Cities are distinctive from other political
                corporations. It has no other right than those conferred upon it by the Legislature.
                This Assembly has the right to pass this bill, which is demanded in the name of
                justice and fair elections. He voted "aye."</p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS, when nil name was called, further opposed the passage of this bill
                because the law of the State limits the taxation of the city of Indianapolis, and it
                is almost Impossible for the city to live within that limit. This bill will increase
                that expense from $25,000 to $50,000. and provides no guarantee or safeguard in any
                way whatever for anything that may go into the hands of these Commissioners. He
                voted "no." </p>

              <p>The vote was announced as above recorded.</p>

              <p>Mr. YOUCHE moved to reconsider the vote just taken. </p>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Put your motion in writing. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD moved to reconsider the vote just taken and to lay that motion on the

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The Senator from Lake [Mr. Youche] has made that
                motion.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD insisted his motion was in order. </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY took a different view. When he concluded- </p>

              <p>Mr. YOUCHE sent up his motion in writing In these words: "I move to reconsider the
                vote by which House bill No. 133 passed the Senate." </p>

              <p>Mr. SMITH, of Jay, moved to lay the motion on the table. </p>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said the Senator from Lake [Mr. Youche] had the floor. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES insisted Mr. Willard's motion should be recognized by the Chair, and Mr.
                Willard desired to submit an appeal from the decision of the Chair. </p>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, declaring the Senator from Lake entitled to the floor, Mr.
                YOUCHE at 4:20 o'clock commenced a speech against the bill and in favor of his
                motion by saying that he voted in the affirmative for the purpose of moving a
                reconsideration. When he concluded.</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN obtained the floor and spoke in favor of the motion to reconsider. During
                his speech a message from the House announced that the Speaker had signed House
                enrolled act No. 133, when Mr. S. concluded at 6 o'clock. </p>

              <p>Mr. VAN VORHIS commenced speaking in favor of the pending motion, </p>

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM took the floor at 8:25o'clock, and he also spoke in favor of the motion. </p>

              <p>Mr. HENRY at 10:10 o'clock p. m. proceeded to make his argument in favor of the
                motion to reconsider the vote by which the metropolitan police bill passed the
                Senate, closing at two minutes after 12 o'clock. </p>

              <p>Mr. BUNDY was recognized by the Chair, but gave way for </p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE, who, after speaking in favor of the passage of the bill, moved to lay
                the question to reconsider on the table. </p>

              <p>The motion was agreed to by yeas, 19; nays, 13 five Senators present but
                paired.</p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES offered a resolution, which was read for information, requiring the
                President of the Senate to sign the act at once, and announce the fact in open
                Senate. </p>

              <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR declared the resolution out of order. </p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN then moved to adjourn, which was lost by a vote of yeas, 12; nays, 20. </p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES submitted a protest, which the Lieutenant Governor ordered spread on the

            <p>Mr. JEWETT confessed that up to yesterday he was under the impression that the claim
              was wrong. He desired, to say now that if no other argument could be produced than the
              argument offered by the gentleman from Knox [Mr. Williams] that the claim was the
              property of a certain bank or wealthy individual the claim should be paid. Such
              argument would sound better in the Sandlots of San Francisco than in this House,
              composed of Representatives of debt-paying people. When so eminent and philanthropic
              citizen, and one of his constituents [referring to Mr. DePauw], is attacked in the
              manner upon this floor he felt called upon to resent such attack. As this was the only
              way provided for these claims to be allowed he did not think the House could afford to
              reject a claim because parties have been pressing its passage. He hoped that when they
              came to act upon this claim it would proceed to consider the basis on its fairness as
              a claim. He entertained such doubts about the validity of the claim that he would not
              give it his support.</p>

            <p>Mr. CAMPBELL thought that the manner in which the claim had been assailed reflected
              somewhat upon the Committee which reported upon this claim. He desired to have certain
              stenographic evidence taken before the Committee read. This evidence would amply
              justify the action taken by the Committee on the John Martin claim.</p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY desired to call the attention of the House to the act under which the Board
              was acting when it issued this warrant to John Martin [Mr. Moody read the provisions
              of the act authorizing the Board to issue warrants.] If this Board had the power to
              issue that warrant in accordance with the provisions of an act, the State of Indiana
              is bound to pay the warrant. You may just as well try to avoid a promissory note
              properly signed as to get rid of this warrant. The question is simply this, whether or
              not we, as Representatives of the State, will refuse this warrant which the law
              authorized this Board so issue? Are we now going to undo this law? If there is any
              fault to be found it should be found with the Legislature that passed this law,
              granting this Board power to issue this warrant.</p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, after giving a detailed statement of the disputed points, and
              the decision of the Court upon the same, stated that be had it directly from Mr. Mania
              himself that the money be obtained from the bank, and for which he gave this warrant
              for co lateral security, went to buy brick that entered into the construction of the
              new Insane Asylum.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. HEFFREN the Committee rope and reported the recommendation that the
              further consideration of the bill be proceeded with in the House. </p>

            <p>The report of the Committee was concurred in by the House. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, the House took up the consideration of the
              specific appropriation bills. </p>

            <p>A motion by Mr. AKIN to postpone the further consideration of the bill was laid on
              the table.</p>

            <p>The question recurred on the John Martin claim. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, thought the name of the State was pledged to the allowance
              of the warrant. The warrant was issued by competent authority, and is held by a
              citizen of this State. He believed this is a just claim, and in the namer of that
              justice which the State of Indiana has always exercised toward her citizens it should
              be allowed. Let us keep her escutcheon clear and untarnished, and let it be said that
              she has done- no injury to any one of tier citizens. </p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON thought it would not keep the escutcheon of the State clear by voting this
              appropriation of nearly $50,000. In his opinion it was nothing against the claim that
              the bank held this warrant as collateral, security. He stated that the content
              provided for masons' measurement, and that it was afterward inserted according to the
              "Indianapolis rules." When this change was discovered, Mr. Martin was informed that if
              he did not desire to accept masons' measurement he must stop work. If you are not
              satisfied with masons' measurement you must not go on. But in the face of this, Mr.
              Martin went on with the work. From that time until the close of the work Mr. Martin
              accepted this measurement and payment accordingly. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILEY was, when the claim was first presented before the <orgName>Judiciary
                Committee</orgName>, favorably impressed with its fairness and honesty, and since he
              had heard the argument against this claim he was more impressed with its fairness than
              he was then. He was not acquainted with Mr. Martin; did not know whether he was a
              Democrat, or Republican, and did not care. Such a matter would not influence him while
              considering a fair and just claim. The State of Indiana can not afford to stultify and
              make void a contract made by the proper agents. He was here as a representative of a
              part of the people of the State of Indiana to say by his voice and his vote that the
              State shall not stultify her contract with a citizen of Indiana, and for this reason
              he was in favor of this claim. It is just, and the State of Indiana should pay it.</p>

            <p> The previous question was demanded on the motion to strike out the ninth "item,"
              being the John Martin Claim, and it was seconded by the House-yeas, 68; nays, 27. </p>

            <p> Mr. PATTEN, in speaking of the decision of the Court in favor of the Board issuing
              this warrant in favor of Mr. Martin, said he did not believe the Court had any right
              to compel this Board to issue said warrant. He knew the claim was unjust, and he knew
              it was so decided by men who were conversant with all the facts. It was so decided by
              a former Legislature. This Board claimed that every dollar due John Martin was paid.
              He had no objection to John Martin or any other man who has an honest claim.</p>

            <p>The motion to strike out was agreed to by yeas, 58; nays, 38.</p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON moved to reconsider the vote to-strike out and lay that motion on the
              table. </p>

            <p>The latter motion way agreed to. </p>

            <p>A motion by Mr. PATTEN, the twelfth item of the bill was stricken out-being the claim
              of Perin &amp; Goff Manufacturing Company of Jeffersonville, Ind., for $5,000 for work
              on buildings at the State Prison South.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. SCHLOSS, the eleventh item of the bill was stricken out-being the
              claim of J. H. Warder of $250 for measuring the wall of the Insane Hospital in the
              interest of the John Martin claim.</p>

            <p> Mr. JEWETT, on the adoption of the 14th item-being the claim to Teresa and Charles
              Bochtell for damages on account of the death of their father, caused by the negligence
              of the State for $1,000, desired that the claim would be allowed by the House. He was
              informed that the condition of the children is deplorable, and the damages asked are
              comparatively small. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN'S amendment requiring the money to be paid to the legal representative of
              the said Bochtell was adopted by the House.</p>

            <p>The item as amended was adopted.</p>

            <p>Mr. SCHLOSS moved to strike out the 15th item.</p>

            <pb n="271" xml:id="VAA8558-21-270"/>

            <p> A division of the item was demanded. </p>

            <p>The question being first upon the appropriation of $500 for the purchase of books for
              the library of the Northern Prison-</p>

            <p>Mr. HUSTON was a member of the <orgName>Committee on Prison</orgName>, and had, with
              other members, visited the Northern Prison. He examined the library, and thought it
              was a disgrace to the Institution, considering the number of convicts. He was
              satisfied that the library was wholly insufficient, and unless some new books were
              added to it, it would be wise to abolish the library entirely. </p>

            <p>Mr. FRAZEE was also conversant with the facts of the condition of the library. He
              thought the House could not do a wiser thing than to allow this $500 for the purchase
              of these books.</p>

            <p>This appropriation was allowed, and the other divisions of the same items were
              adopted.</p>

            <p>In the specific appropriation for the Southern Prison the allowance of $15,000 for
              the finishing of the Hospital building was cut down to $1,500. </p>

            <p>The appropriation of $5,000 the construction of a building to connect the cell house
              with the office, was struck out on motion by Mr. Huston.</p>

            <p> The House took a recess untill 2 o'clock.</p>

            <p>Mr. FRAZEE, pending the adoption of the amendment, stated the necessity of purchasing
              more land for these Institutions.</p>

            <p>Mr. DEEM said that the object of this appropriation is to enable the Trustees of the
              Asylum and Home to purchase seventy five Acres of land adjoining the present grounds,
              and which additional grounds are to be used for agricultural and dairy purposes. At
              present, only fifty-six acres are owned by the Home, but a small portion of which can
              be cultivated, and the Trustees often find it difficult or inconvenient to lease lands
              in the vicinity. There will be an actual saving to the State by purchasing the
              proposed farm, and will give the officials an opportunity to train the orphans of

              Perin &amp; Goff Manufacturing Company of Jeffersonville, Ind., was struck out of the
              appropriation bill.</p>

            <p> Mr. McCORMICK stated that these men replaced the old shops with good, substantial
              brick shops. He considered this a just claim, and one that should be passed. </p>

            <p> Mr. GIBSON stated that the claim was before the Commitee and was allowed. He hoped
              that the House would reconsider the vote. These men are simply asking reimbursement
              for money paid out.</p>

            <p> Mr. CAMPBELL had full confidence in the justice of the claim.</p>

            <p> The motion to reconsider was rejected.</p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, the amendment was laid on the table. </p>

            <p>Several other amendments were offered and rejected, whereupou Mr. Gibson moved that

            the minutes?</p>

          <p>Mr. WILLARD replied: The Chair ordered them to be taken down. </p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR responded: Not to be put into the minutes.</p>

          <p>When the reading was renewed-</p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR said the minutes are not correct. The minutes show that a
            Senator on this floor was elected President; pro tem. last night, and that there was a
            time during the session of the Senate last night when there was no President of the
            Senate, and I desire to have the minutes corrected as to that. I will call attention to
            the rules on that subject. Rule 6 reads: "The President shall have the right to name any
            Senator to perform the duties of the Chair, but such substitution shall not extend
            beyond an adjournment." You will remember, and the minutes show, that at the convening
            of the Senate yesterday afternoon the Lieutenant Governor was in the Chair. About 9
            o'clock I called the Senator from Rush [Mr. Spann] to the Chair, and was sitting in the
            cloak room close by. I went out for a few minutes, and when I came into the Senate
            Chamber the Senator from Rush was still in the Chair. The Chair had the power, under
            this rule of the Senate, when the Senate met yesterday afternoon to call any Senator to
            the Chair, and that Senator for the time would have the same rights as the Lieutenant
            Governor-the President of the Senate proper. Therefore, that part of the minutes which
            declares there was no President of the Senate, does not speak the truth, and that part
            of the minutes ought to be corrected I desire to have this statement of the Chair taken
            down and go into the records. Just before the adjournment the Chair made a statement of
            some length that would occupy some three or four pages of that journal, stating the
            position of the Chair about what purported to be an enrolled act of the House. I see the
            Secretary has only a few lines on that subject. I desire the remarks of the Chair on the
            point of order to go upon the journal The Secretary states in the minutes that Senator
            Voyles offered a resolution. There was no resolution offered to the Senate. The record
            as to that is incorrect </p>

          <p>Mr. WILLARD (interposing): In what respect?</p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The Senator from Washington [Mr. Voyles] rose in his place and
            asked leave of the Senate to introduce a resolution. Several Senators objected, and the
            Chair stated that the Senate refused leave. Then the resolution was read for
            information-that is to see whether the Senators would give their consent.</p>

          <p>Mr. WILLARD: That is what the journal shows. </p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: If that is the way it is, it is right. The Chair stated to the
            Senator who one red the resolution that the Senate refused to permit him unless the
            rules of the Senate be suspended. There was no motion made by any Senator to suspend the
            rules for the Senator to offer the resolution. The minutes do not show that. The
            resolution as submitted or offered by the Senator from Washington ought not to go on the
            minutes for the reason that it was not before the Senate in any manner, shape or
            form.</p>

          <p>Mr. BUNDY thought what the Chair has said about the minutes being incorrect is true:
            especially that part which relates to the explanation the Chair made early this morning
            at time of the protest was entered by the Senator from Washington. It is the business of
            the journal, if it states anything, to state the exact facts. It is the duty of the
            Senate to arrive at the exact facts as nearly as possible, and when so arrived at it can
            do no one any harm. He moved that the minutes be corrected in that particular in the
            particulars the Chair has named. </p>

          <p>Mr. VOYLES moved to lay the motion on the table, which motion was seconded by Mr.
            Willard</p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The minutes have to be corrected.</p>

          <p>Mr. BUNDY thought that a question of the <pb n="274" xml:id="VAA8558-21-273"/> highest
            privilege. He didn't want to do anything unfair.</p>

          <p>Mr. McINTOSH Didn't you suggest to correct the minutes as the President stated?</p>

          <p>Mr. BUNDY: If so it was not properly stated. In the particulars in which the journal is
            incorrect he moved it be corrected. If there is any- thing in the journal not correct it
            ought to be corrected-that is nothing more than fair.</p>

          <p>Mr. McINTOSH thought the motion should be put in writing. </p>

          <p>Mr. BUNDY: I will examine the journal and put my motion in writing in the particulars I
            think incorrect.</p>

          <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: The order for correcting the minutes will stay in abeyance
            until the motion is made in writing.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD said the present dog law has proved very unpopular. Now dogs by
                hundreds are umtagged and untaxed, the law being practically a dead letter. The
                provision will come in 1884. As the owner has been taxed doubly, the law has an
                emergency clause so the assessment will be made this spring, as was in the old law
                previous to 1881. Then the Assessors did not practically carry out and enforce the
                law. If the Assessor knows the man assessed has not listed his dog the Assessor is
                fined $5, it is a doubtful question whether a tagged dog can be killed under any
                circumstances, but this law allows that where the dog is known to have killed or
                maimed a sheep. Unless a law of this kind is passed within a year there will not be
                a penny of revenue derived from this source.</p>

            <head rend="center">THE'GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.</head>

            <p> Mr. HEFFREN moved to reconsider the vote by which the report of the
                <orgName>Conference Committee</orgName> on bill [H. R. 302], the general
              appropriation bill was concurred in by the House.</p>

            <p>Mr. FRAZER stated by way of explanation that the purpose of the motion was to
              reconsider the report of the <orgName>Conference Committee</orgName> on the general
              appropriation bill. The object, as he understood it, was to defeat the general
              appropriation bill. He thought the motion should not pass for the reason that this
              Conference report is satisfactory to a great majority of the members of both Houses.
              This bill has been agreed to by a large majority of both Houses, and there is no
              reason why it should be reconsidered. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN said: I had hoped that I would not be compelled to make this motion. I am
              opposed to an extra session. But circumstances have occurred in the other branch of
              this General Assembly that Imperatively call for this motion. To any one who has
              witnessed the scenes in the Senate during the past twenty-four hours he would be
              recreant to every principle of duty to his Democratic brethren of the Senate if he did
              not do this. Could the people of this State have seen the presiding officer by brute
              force trample under foot every rule of that body, every principle of parliamentary
              law: could they have seen him take an enrolled bill passed by both Houses of this
              General Assembly, and deliberately thrust it into his pocket and declare it never
              should become a law; when I am credibly informed that another functionary still higher
              than the President of the Senate is also of that opinion, and will interpose a veto so
              late that this General Assembly can not act upon it, and when there could have been
              seen a Superintendent of Police, two Captains of Police, and twenty-one policemen,
              backed up by the Sheriff of Marion County, on the floor to overawe the Democratic
              Senator, and to give moral and material aid to the conspirators, I am ready to let the
              Governor of Indiana assume the responsibilities, and say to him: "You shall not thus
              obstruct legislation, and if you do you shall have no appropriation." I shall stand by
              my party and unequivocally support its policy.</p>

            <p>Mr. SHIVELY had hoped that this part of the General Assembly would endeavor to take
              care of its own proceedings, and that fairness and justice should prevail at all
              times. He thought the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Heffren] had violated all
              parliamentary law in his criticism upon the acts of the presiding officer of the
              Senate of this General Assembly. It illy became the gentleman from Washington to
              criticise the action of the President of the Senate since he himself was a party but a
              few days ago to acts equally as malicious as those he now charges upon that officer.
              When this metropolitan police bill and several other bills were read the third time
              and put upon their passage, the Democratic Speaker of this House persistently refused
              to recognize Republican members on this floor although they eagerly sought such
              recognition. If the Democrats wish to take the responsibility of an extra session, by
              reconsidering the action on the appropriation bill, why very well, go on. The Senate
              has been guided in its ruling by the precedent set by the Democratic Speaker of this
              House. </p>

            <p>Mr GIBSON was very much surprised that gentlemen should be worked up over a little
              thing of this kind. Members are very much mistaken if they think there is no reason
              for this consideration but to force an extra session of the Legislature. It is simply
              because there are some provisions in the bill which are objectionable. He desired to
              second the criticism of the action that bag been going on lit the other end of the
              building. Such action would justify any action on the part of the members of this
              House. He was willing, taking into consideration the action in the Senate, to share
              his part of the responsibility of an extra session. Whenever a man has not brains
              enough to comprehend what is just to the majority of the Senate-overriding the
              majority by infamous decisions-he should be criticised. Such a brainless coward is the
              man who occupies the Chair in the other end of the building.</p>

            <p> Mr. HUSTON was of the opinion that the minority might as well look at this thing
              calmly and not get into an ill humor about it; but he thought every member should have
              the privilege of expressing his opinion. The question before the House is whether or
              not we shall reconsider the vote on the general appropriation bill. Now, there Is no
              member on this floor who will not readily admit that the result would be to force an
              extra session. He believed that the attempt was to defeat the appropriation bill-to
              get it in such a condition that the Democratic members of this General Assembly may
              say to the Governor: "If you dare not sign and return to us this metropolitan police
              bill, which was crowded through the House under the 'gag-law,' at once, we will defeat
              the appropriation bill." If the Democrats had alternated to reconsider this question
              at the proper time he would have voted for such reconsideration. He thought, with the
              precedent the Speaker of the House had set in refusing to recognize Republicans on the
              floor of this House, the Democratic members should not wince nor complain of arbitrary
              ruling in the other end of this building.</p>

            <p>Mr. BOWERS voted for the appropriation bill, and had been since that time frequently
              importuned by Republican members to move to reconsider the vote. He was now ready and
              willing to vote for such reconsideration.</p>

            <p> Mr. COPELAND thought it came with very poor grace for a Democratic member to charge
              open handed revolution against the Republican party or its representatives on this
              floor; that it ill becomes the Democratic members on this floor to denounce Lieutenant
              Governor Hanna, a gallant soldier in the late War, as a brainless coward, a
              revolutionist and dictator. It ill becomes you, who from the beginning of the session
              have embraced every opportunity to thrust on the minority of this House that most
              infamous of all rules, the gag-law, under the leadership of a rampant, unrepentant
              ex-Son of Liberty. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN rose to a question of order and demanded that the words just spoken by
              the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Copeland] be taken down, and declaring the language
              used unparliamentary. </p>

            <p>The Speaker commanded the Clerk to take down the language used by Mr. Copeland, which
              the Speaker decided to be unparliamentary, and ordered Mr. Copeland to sit down.</p>

            <p> Mr. COPELAND answered that in Russia it might do to order a man to sit down, but
              that such tyrannical methods would not be tolerated in the General Assembly of the
              great State of Indiana. When you gentlemanly rule that I am out of order I shall take
              my seat, but not until then. </p>

            <p>The SPEAKER declared the gentleman to be out of order. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN said: I merely rise to make a single statement. I do not propose now to
              so into political or a political discussion-time enough for that yet. I have to say of
              the intemperate language of the member from Jefferson [Mr. Copeland] that it reminds
              me of an occurrence I witnessed last summer. I was reposing on a grassy plat and
              looking up into the foliage of a pine tree, a little bird alighted on the top-most
              swinging bough and sang out, "Tom-tit," "torn-tit " In an instance he threw his head
              down and his tall up and sang out, "Tom-tit." I must say that I could not tell "which
              end the song came from." and I am at equal loss to tell where the clamor and noise. In
              unparliamentary language, comes from that was poured forth by the member from
              Jefferson. I pose him.</p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN was one of the members who vot<pb n="277" xml:id="VAA8558-21-276"/>ed
              against the appropriation bill. He did it because he thought it was his duty. He
              desired to say that it was not his desire to have an extra Session. ' </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT was of the opinion that in all the discussion there had been no reason
              advanced why this motion to reconsider should prevail. He coined heartily in what
              gentlemen had said about the scenes in the other end of the building going down in
              history as one of the worst exhibitions of petty tyranny ever perpetrated. He believed
              that the members were not in the right mood to discuss this question further at
              present, and made an ineffectual motion to postpone the question until 10 o'clock to
              morrow. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, believed that such a thing as repealing the general
              appropriation bill had never occurred. He hoped that the second step would not be
              taken in this revolutionary measure, </p>

            <p>Mr. WILS0N, of Marion, had likened to the discussion of this question and had heard,
              he was sorry to say many things that had no bearing upon the question under
              consideration. He hoped there would not be an extra session. He could not see that any
              good would come of an extra session, and if the Senate and Governor would act promptly
              and without delay there will be a way out of this difficulty. He moved the previous
              question, which was seconded by the House. </p>

            <p>The previous question was ordered by a vote of yeas, 54; nays, 33.</p>

            <p>Under the operations of the previous question the motion to reconsider the vote on
              the concurrence in the <orgName>Conference Committee</orgName> report was agreed to by
              yeas, 67; nays, 41. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. HEFFREN the report was laid on the table by yeas, 57; nays, 40. </p>

                  target="#HB_1883_01_04_256">H. R. 256</ref>], to provide a fund for the permanent
                endowment of the State University which was read the third time. </p>

              <p>Mr. SUTTON favored the passage of the bill with the prevent provisions. This bill
                seeks to give five cents en the $1,000. A man who pays a tax of $10,000 would pay a
                tax of fifty cents to this institution. But this tax as provided under the
                previsions of this bill will raise a tax of $45,000 yearly. He understood that
                overtures had been made to some of the Professors by Eastern Colleges and he favored
                placing the school in such a concition that these men would be retained. </p>

              <p>Mr. HEFFREN. I have said nothing upon thi bill in its various stages, and shall say
                but little now. I perhaps am differently constituted from many on this floor. 1 have
                never yet learned to weigh dimes and dollars against education, knowledge and
                science. For half a century Indiana has had a University with no endowment fund. It
                is time she had such an Institution well endowed, where her sons may achieve
                distinction in the battle of life. I would have one Institution, where we might
                point in after years and say, there was another Galileo or another Herschel brought
                forth to the world; one who, pointing his telescope into infinite space, could make
                new discoveries; where comets and planets perform their stupendous revolutions, that
                would ennoble the name and fame of Indiana. I would have another Cuvier produced,
                who, by comparative anotomy, can reconstruct the monsters of ancient times from a
                single bone. I would have a Hugh Miller, with his geologist's hammer in his hand,
                standing fit the loot of some mighty cliff, roll back the curtain of time, and, as
                he laid bare the rocks, read of ages long since passed and gone, and what and who
                inhabited this world of ours. I would have one place where Indiana's sons and
                daughters could store the mind with knowledge, civilization and science, find where
                they might go forth from and flaunt their names high up on the ladder of fame where
                their attainments, knowledge and genius should stand as beacon lights to a lesser
                informed world. This would I have Indiana do for her children, and thus would I rear
                a monument of science and intelligence that would stand out in all the glory and
                splendor that could encircle go noble and glorious a purpose. Endow this University,
                pass this bill, and Indiana's name will be honored when our bodies shall be dust and
                we gathered to our rewards. I hope the bill will pass.</p>

            <head rend="center">ENDOWMENT FUND FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITY</head>

            <p>On motion of Mr. DUNCAN the bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_256">H. R. 256</ref>]
              to provide a fund for the permanent endowment of the State University, under a setting
              aside of the Constitutional restriction, by a two-thirds vote was read the second time
              by title, the third time by sections. </p>

            <p>Mr. DUNCAN explained: It authorizes a levy of one-half cent on each $100 valuation
              for twelve years. It passed the House by a vote of 70 to 21. The bill, as a matter of
              economy and good mannagement of the State's indebtedness, and put into a
              non-negotiable 5 per cent University endowment fund bond. We appropriate annually
              $23,000 for the management of the University, and at the end of twelve years this plan
              would amount to but $4,000 more than under the present plan. By the levy of this tax
              the annual appropriation would be done away with, thus, making a large saving. This
              would place the University on a firm foundation, so it will not hereafter be the
              creature of every Legislature. It would have an annual revenue derived from interest
              on this non-negotiable bond. Such an interest should be kept free from sectarian
              basis. We owe a duty to the people of the State to place that Institution on a
              permanent foundation. The bill provides the fund shall follow the Institution should
              it be consolidated with another or removed from the present location.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY moved to amend so that the fund would be held for a consolidated
              institution should the University ever be consolidated with another. He was a friend
              of the Institution. The word "thereafter," an indefinite term, is probably wrongly
              used, and this amendment proposes to make that word "hereafter," thus making it
              definite. The time will come when the Educational Institutions of the State should be
              consolidated. This is a way to prevent the constant changes made by every
              Legislature.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN said there was no better friend on the floor to this Institution than
              himself. He favored the amendment and hoped it would be adopted, with the assurance
              from the author of the amendment, if the House refuses to concur, he was willing to
              have the Senate recede therefrom.</p>

            <head rend="center">JOHNSON VS OVERSTREET CONTEST</head>

            <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH called up the special order, being the consideration of the majority
              and minority report of the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName> in the matter of
              the contest for the seat of the Counties of Johnson and Morgan-see pages 63, 66, 214
              and 221 of the Brevier Reports.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES in view of all the evidence he had heard believes this seat in all
              justice and right belongs to the contestor in this case, and the conduct of the
              sitting member has been such as should deprive him of his seat as Senator. There were
              thirty-two illegal votes cast for Overstreet in Morgan County, and some seventeen or
              twenty-one in Johnson County. Then there was a corrupt bargain by which the contestor
              was defeated made with a man by the name of William Rude. He claimed that Richard M.
              Johnson was elected, but is barred out by eighty-five votes resting upon fraud and
              illegality. There were at least fifty votes illegally cast for Overstreet through
              fraud and intimidation, which are twin brothers. He hoped Richard M. Johnson would be
              seated. He spoke with considerable difficulty on account of not feeling well.</p>

            <p> Mr. LOCKRIDGE, a member of the Committee to whom the contest was referred, declared
              that simplifying the grounds of contest, they are but two-the first and fourth clauses
              under Section 4,756 R. S. 1881. But at the eleventh hour of this <pb n="280"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-279"/> proceeding, when the Senate had been in session several
              days, and on the very day the Senate met to consider this case, a new ground of
              contest is filed, under the guise of an amendment, and is admitted by a majority vote
              of the Committee, and thus we have a <hi rend="i">third</hi> cause of contest, in
              direct violation of the statute providing for the manner of proccedure in contested
              cases in Section 4,747 R. S. And what is the nature of this amendment? That the
              contestee bribed or offered to bribe, on the 7th of November last. There are no
              specifications, but only a vague and indefinite charge. A cloud of witnesses are
              subpenaed at the expense of the State, and all this time the contestee is denied his
              right to have his specifications of the charge against him made known - a right that
              is denied to no defendant, in any Court of Justice in Christendom outside of an
              autocratic form of Government. He asked whether such a proceeding is in the interest
              of justice and fair play. Whether the admission of the amendment to the grounds of
              contest at the late hour it was done, and in the face of the statute which prescribes
              that it shall be done within ten days after the election, and the refusal of the
              contestor to furnish specifications of his charge against the contestee, is in accord
              with the spirit of the Constitution, which says that "justice shall be administered
              freely and without purchase; completely and without, denial; speedily and without
              delay," and that the accused shall have the right "to demand the nature and cause of
              the accusation against him, and to have a copy thereof " Under the sanctity of his
              oath he bad reached the conclusions embodied in the majority report, that the charge
              is not sustained by sufficient evidence to entitle the contestor to a seat in the
              Senate. </p>

            <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH confined his remarks more particularly 10 the charge of bribery. Were
              he sitting as a Juror to try the question he would hare to conclude that the contestee
              had violated the law of the State in that particular and should suffer for the crime.
              He regarded the testimony of the contestee as a sham, and the testimony of a guilty
              man-having no mild words for a man who will use such means to secure an election, for
              if there is one danger above another that threatens our institutions, it is the danger
              that threatens the corruption of the ballot-box. Before he concluded-</p>

            <head rend="center"> AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>

            <p>Mr. FOULKE, rising to a question of privilege, said he had the authority of the
              Senator from Crawford [Mr. Benz] for the statement that he was approached by a party
              asking him how much he would take to vote for the metropolitan police bill. Therefore
              Mr. F. moved that a Committee of Three be appointed to inquire into it, with power to
              send for persons and papers. </p>

            <p>The motion was agreed, to, and subsequently the Lieutenant Governor made the
              Committee to consist of Messrs. Foulke, McIntosh and Youche </p>


            <div type="section">
              <head rend="center">JOHNSON AND OVERSTREET CONTENT.</head>

              <p>Mr. McCULLOUGH resumed his speech interrupted by the noon recess. He quoted very
                largely from the testimony taken before the Committee, and favored the adoption of
                the minority report submitted by himself, declaring that the charge of bribery is
                fully made out and sustained by evidence. </p>

              <p> Mr. FOULKE spoke in favor of the majority report. His remarks will be printed
                hereafter.</p>

              <p>Mr. SAYRE contended that the action of the sitting member was not bribery, even if
                taken in the sense the Senator from Gibson [Mr. McCullough] wants to give it.
                Instead of there being testimony that would convict Senator Overstreet of the
                charge. It is not even a contract that could be enforced in a Court of Justice,
                where the plaintiff is required only to establish his case by a preponderance of
                testimony. So far as illegal votes are concerned there were just as many on one side
                as on the other, and neither will exceed a half dozen or ten when the proof comes to
                be examined closely. But even if there were forty or fifty illegal votes as the
                Senator from Washington [Mr. Voyles] has said, Mr. Johnson would not be entitled to
                the seat, for Mr. Overstreet's majority was eighty-five, and if even fifty votes
                were taken therefrom there would still be left a clear majority of thirty-five. His
                judgment was that neither of these majority reports should be sustained by the
                Senate, but that the majority report should. The three Republican members of the
                Committee, and the Senator from Allen and Whitly [Mr. Bell] and the Senator from
                Marion [Mr. Fletcher], who signed that report after listening patiently to the
                testimony and able argument, have submitted it to the Senate, as their judgment
                justified by the facts in the case. </p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD spoke in favor of the substitute report [Mr. Voyles']. His remarks will
                be printed hereafter. </p>

              <p>Mr. OVERSTREET spoke in his own behalf. His remark i will be printed hereafter. The

            <head rend="center">TAX EXEMPTION.</head>

            <p>Mr. Schloss' bill [H. R. 290] to repeal Section 105 of an act concerning taxation,
              being Section 373 of the Revised Statutes of 1881, was read the third time.</p>

            <p> Mr. WILSON, of Marion, was in favor of the passage of this bill. He believed as the
              statutes now stand, the men who form these Associations <pb n="282"
                xml:id="VAA8558-21-281"/> to pay double and sometimes treble tax.</p>

            <p>Mr. McMULLEN was from a County in which several such Associations exist. They are
              composed entirely of poor, laboring men, who can pay only up one or two dollars per
              week. By joining these Associations and paying a small assessment into the general
              fund of the Association, a member may draw from the fund a stipulated Amount. With
              this amount he can purchase a Sot or build for himself a small house, and this is the
              object of these Associations. This bill is simply to relieve the shares held in such
              Associations from tax.</p>

            <p>Mr. STERRITT stated that several of the Associations exist in the County which he
              represents. He thought it was unjust to tax the men upon the shares held in such
              Association and at the same time tax him upon the property that he buys with the money
              secured on these shares. </p>

            <p>Mr. MONTGOMERY said these Building Associations loan all their money each Monday and
              take a mortgage upon the property purchased by the member securing the loan. He did
              not think it just to tax he property and at the same time tax the share-holder in such
              Association. It was simply to avoid double and triple taxation, and he, therefore,
              thought the bill should pass.</p>

            <p>Mr. SHOCKNEY said; This bill ought to become a law. It is directly in the interest of
              a large number of laboring people who are striving to obtain a home of their own by
              depositing small pittances of their meager earnings with these Association's, and
              investing the same in small houses. Under the law as it now is these poor people are
              compelled to pay taxes on shares of stock they hare surrendered as well as on the
              property they buy, while the Associations, also, are compelled to pay taxes on the
              mortgages lead to secure the payment of dues-making treble taxation upon a needy class
              of industrious, but poor, laboring people. </p>

            <p>The bill was rejected by yeas, 40; nays, 45. </p>

            <head rend="center">MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES.</head>

            <p>Mr. Shively's bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_293">H. R. 293</ref>] concerning
              Mutual Life Insurance Companies was read the third time [The bill provides, first,
              that all Insurance Companies doing business on the assessment plan shall issue a bond
              payable to the State of Indiana for the faithful performance of their contract with
              their policy-holders. It makes it a felony for any Insurance Company doing business in
              this State to take out a policy on the life of an infirm, aged or crippled person. It
              also compels all such Companies doing business in this State to make a report on or
              before the 31st day of August of each year to the Auditor of State, giving a detailed
              account of its business. And a failure to do so will work a forfeiture of its
              charter.]</p>

            <p> Mr. SCHLOSS said Building and Loan Associations are in existence all over the State
              for the purpose of mechanics and laboring men to acquire homes by monthly payments
              into the Society of $15 per month each month. Two shares are drawn for, $500 each, and
              such shares are given to such members as are applying for them. They will have to buy
              lots or build houses for such money and give real estate security. In this way poor
              people will get homes. This bill will do away with taxing the shares, but all money
              drawn is put into property, and such property is taxed according to law. </p>

            <p> Mr. SHIVELY believed that all the members would agree with him that some legislation
              was necessary upon this subject of insurance. If there has been more complaint about
              one than another it has been about this matter of insurance, and the matter of doing
              business for the last few years. The bill was drawn up by the <orgName>Insurance
                Committee</orgName> and it comes here recommended by that Committee. </p>

            <p>Mr. MELLETT agreed with the gentleman from Wabash [Mr. Shively] when he says that
              there is demand for protection against fraudulent Insurance Associations, and if this
              bill provided such protection he would heartily indorse it. He called upon the members
              to examine it can fully before they indorsed it to see whether or not it does provide
              this protection. This bill seems to be entirely different from the one offered by the
              gentleman from Wabash at the beginning of the session. He did not believe this bill
              would give satisfaction to the people of the State. In the first place it, confers too
              much power upon the Auditor of State. So far as that is concerned, you might strike
              out all but he one section and leave the whole matter with the Auditor of Stale. He
              also e is to say whether or not a Company shall do business in this State. The bill
              provides that any ten members of any corporation may upon demand request the Auditor
              to make an investigation of the affairs of such Association. Now, if ten men are
              sufficient to require an investigation, why not say that one man may demand an
              investigation? Under the provisions of this bill no man is allowed to renew his
              Insurance, it matters not how long he has been injured in the Company, or how prompt
              he map have been in his payments, though it has relapsed, because of failure to pay an
              annuity for a single day or even an hour, for that matter. The previsions of this bill
              make it a felony for that, man or any of his friends, to renew that policy. If this
              bill becomes a law, so far from protecting the people, so far from giving satisfaction
              to the people, it will be the means of crushing out every organization of this kind
              organized in this State, and turning this business over into the hands of foreign
              Insurance Companies. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, of Knox, was satisfied that the reason why the gentleman from Delaware
              [Mr. Millett] was opposed to the bill was because he did not, understand the
              provisions of the bill. There is a demand from every part of the State that the "Death
              Rattle" Insurance Companies should be cut off. Representatives of the leading and
              solvent Insurance Companies are here in the interest of this bill. The only objection
              they have against this bill is that it discriminates against foreign Companies in
              favor of Companies in this State. The objection is that this bill gives the Auditor of
              States too much power. This objection comes from these "Death Rattle" Companies that
              shrink from an investigation. In answer to an objection made against the bill that it
              did not require a foreign Company to give resident security on their bonds, he did not
              think it would be just to require them to do so, for the reason that it might be
              difficult for them to do so, even though they are good, solvent Companies. This bill
              simply provides that Companies doing business on the assessment plan shall not issue
              endowment certificates. These Companies can not do a fair business and issue endowment
              certificates.</p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN bought the matter was fully discussed, and therefore moved the previous
              question, which was seconded by the House. </p>

            <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 67; nays, 21. </p>

            <head rend="center">THE NEW STATE HOUSE.</head>

            <p>The special order was called up [Mr. McMullen in the Chair] being bill [H. R. 466]
              supplemental to an act to authorize and provide for the erection of a new State House
              and for matters incident thereto.</p>

            <p> The question recurred on the amendment offered by Mr. McCormick striking out all
              after the<pb n="283" xml:id="VAA8558-21-282"/> enacting clause and inserting new
              matter in lieu thereof.</p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN hoped that the amendment should not prevail for the reason that there is
              nothing in it farther than to strike out all after the reacting clause and insert
              entire new matter. There is nothing in the proposition to provide tor the continuance
              of these bonds given by the old State House Commissioners. He believed the State
              should get through this matter and keep within the $2,000,000, and according to the
              evidence before the Committee he believed that it coul4 be built with that amount. He
              was of the opinion that no public building in the United States was ever constructed
              with more economy and better management than has this building so far as the work had
              progressed, and if constructed within the $2,000,000 it will be the cheapest public
              building in the country. He added that although the bond of the present contractors
              was good, it was doubtful if there could be any recovery upon it until the building
              was completed.</p>

            <p>Mr. MOCK was in favor of holding to the original contract, and in holding the present
              contractors to their contract. He thought they had no right to change that contract.
              The change in the price of labor and material, of which we have heard so much, should,
              have nothing to do with the original contract. If these men do not desire to stand by
              their contract, let them give it up. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, was impressed with the question whether or not, like
              Shylock, we were going to hold every man to his pound of flesh. Whether the State of
              Indiana, whether it be right or wrong, will require the pound of flesh from every man?
              If this contact was made at a time when material and labor was at a low price, and it
              has since advanced, in consequence of which three men have been great losers, the
              State of Indiana should not say there is your bond, now we want the pound of flesh cut
              from next your heart. He was on the floor when the bill was passed for the erection of
              the new State House, and the prevailing opinion then was that the State House could
              not be built for $2,000,000. Viewing this matter as he did and taking into
              consideration the fast that the provisions of the bill of the gentleman from
              Bartholomew-[Mr. McCormick] are for $4,000,000, he was in favor of the bill that did
              not break the original contract. </p>

            <p>Mr. HAM did not understand that the amendment proposed that the State House shall
              cost two million dollars. His understanding was that if this amendment is adopted it
              will simply re-enact the old law with one or two exceptions. Now the original bill
              provides that it may be relet the same contractors, that the Commissioners may relet
              this contract for a sum not to exceed two million dollars, but no other persons shall
              be allowed to put in a bid. He was of the opinion that if this contract was relet to
              the same parties they might be knocking at the door of the next Legislature for
              another appropriation. </p>

            <p>Mr. HUSTON was a member of the Committee which investigated this question, and he was
              opposed to the adoption of this amendment. He was opposed to the amendment because it
              required the reletting of the contract, thereby causing great delay in the work and
              injury to the building in its present condition. Mr. Huston continued at some length. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN moved to postpone the further consideration until 2 o'clock, which was
              agreed to. </p>

            <p>Mr. Bowers' bill [H. R. 191] to regulate the practice of medicine, mid wifery and
              surgery, was taken up, read the third time, and postponed until 3 o'clock this
              afternoon.</p>

            <p>The special order being the bill [H. R. 466] to authorize and provide for the
              erection of a new State House, is was called up.</p>

            <p>Mr GIBSON moved to postpone the further consideration until 9 o'clock to-morrow. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN made an ineffectual motion-yeas, 21; nays. 54-to lay the motion on the
              table. </p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON was of the opinion that as the House had appointed a Committee, had
              employed a stenographer, had rented rooms, had incurred the additional expense of
              having the sworn testimony taken before that Committee printed, it should postpone
              this question until to-morrow, when this printed testimony and evidence would be
              before the House. </p>

            <p>Mr. MOODY regarded this proposition as one of the most important questions that was
              before the House this session. He was not in favor of waiting for the printed
              evidence, or postponing this matter tor that purpose. </p>

            <p>Mr. JEWETT was in favor of considering the question now. He was not in favor of
              retarding the matter by any subterfuge, and desired to meet the question fairly and,
              without delay. He was satisfied that the members would not have time to examine the
              printed evidence at this late hour. </p>

            <p>Mr. PATTEN was in favor of postponing the question until to-morrow. He thought the
              discussion had gone far enough and demanded the previous question.</p>

            <p>The previous question was seconded by the House-yeas. 66; nays, 31-and under its
              operation the motion to postpone was agreed to by yeas, 52; nays, 44.</p>

            <p>Mr. ROBINSON called up the bill [S. 139] to amend Sections 5,472 and 5,480 of the
              code of 1881, concerning coal mines. The bill was read the third time and passed the
              House by yeas, 88; nays 0. </p>

              <head rend="center">A MEDICAL BILL.</head>

              <p>Mr. Bowers' bill [H. R. 91] to regulate the practice of medicine, midwifery and
                surgery, was taken up as the special order. </p>

              <p>Mr. ANTRIM thought there were some provisions of the bill that should not become a
                law in this State. He thought in some cases it would work a hardship. </p>

              <p>Mr. STRAUGHAN was a physician and was in favor of the passage of this bill. It was
                legislation not to protect physicians of the State, but to protect the people from
                quacks and pretenders driven into this State by stringent medical laws enacted in
                other States. </p>

              <p>Mr. PATTEN was opposed to the bill. The learned physicians from his County bad
                requested him to oppose the bill. They did not desire such legislation. </p>

              <p>Mr LOWERS was in favor of the bill. He desired K see the standard of medicine
                raised in the Sta's. And this was the object of sued legislation. He moved that the
                bill be recommitted to a Special Committee with instructions. </p>

            <p> Mr. SPANN, Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on the Whole</orgName>, returned the
              specific appropriation bill [H. R. 460] recommending its passage with the amendments
              adopted b ' the Committee at last night's session. </p>

            <p>On motion by Mr. VOYLES the amendment allowing the Talbott claim was struck out a
              bill for the purpose having passed both Houses.</p>

            <p>Mr. McINTOSH objected to allowing $1,300 to M. M. Campbell,regarding it as a
              gift.</p>

            <p>Mr. JOHNSON, Chairman of the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>, did not
              regard it as a claim proper, but he was a painstaking teacher, and deserved pay for
              the extra services in the State University from 1835 to 1852. It is a recognition of
              very excel- lent services. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH was on the Committee two years <pb n="286" xml:id="VAA8558-21-285"/> ago,
              when it was a concluded point that he should Mare about this amount; but fearing a
              portion of the money would go into the hands of lawyers who were pushing the matter,
              did not make the report.</p>

            <p> Mr. YANCEY expressed such fears now, and for that reason opposed the appropriation. </p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY moved to amend by adding there to that the amount shall be paid to the
              said Campbell in person, or to his executor or administrator. It was agreed to by
              yeas, 27; nays, 12. The item as amended was agreed to by yeas, 17; nays, 15.</p>

            <p> The Senate refused to concur in the Committee amendment proposing to allow the John
              Martin claim of $46,736 46, by yeas, 21; nays, 23.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN moved to amend the report of the <orgName>Committee of the Whole</orgName>
              by adding $5,152.68 for lightning rods placed on the Insane Asylum by David R. Munson.
              Mr. Brown recited its history.</p>

            <p> Mr. McINTOSH remembered this claim as before the House when he was a member two
              years ago and he regarded it as unjust.</p>

            <p> Mr. MAGEE spoke against it.</p>

            <p> Mr. DUNCAN hoped the item would pass.</p>

            <p> Mr. BELL said it was wrong unless Senators knew something against claims, to get up
              and oppose them. The evil of lobbying to get just claims through would pass out, of
              existence, When the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName> recommended a claim it
              ought not be opposed by work or vote of any Senator who knew nothing about it. </p>

              <p> Mr. SPANN offered the following:</p>

              <p>Whereas, The Board of State House Commissioners have recommended additional
                legislation, the passage of which bill was in their opinion, necessary to secure the
                speedy completion of said building according to the plans and specifications adopted
                by said Board; and </p>

              <p>Whereas, Such legislation has been defeated in the House of Representatives; and </p>

              <p>Whereas, It is of the utmost importance to the taxpayers of the State of Indiana
                that said building should be completed as speedily as possible; therefore, </p>

              <p>Resolved, by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring therein, That in
                the event that the present State House contractors do not prosecute the work as last
                as the State House Commissioners are hereby authorized to cancel said contract and
                to relet said building to the lowest responsible bidder. Provided, That the same
                shall not be relet at a greater price or sum than $2,000,000.</p>

              <p> Mr. S. moved for a suspension of the rules to allow of the immediate consideration
                of this resolution.</p>

              <p> The motion gave rise to a long discussion, and was agreed to by yeas, 25; nays,

              <p>The discussion [see appendix to these reports] was continued, and finally the

                in relation to the lighting of cities and towns with the electric system was

              <p>Mr. GRAHAM understood the bill as amended does not limit the height of tower that
                may be erected under its provision. He did not think the Legislature ought to
                license that to be done which may deprive citizens of the enjoyment of their
                property if not endanger their lives. He could net support the bill. ' </p>

              <p>Mr. CAMPBELL, understanding this bill contains nearly all the amendments reported

              <p>On motion by Mr. SAYRE, the bill [<ref target="#HB_1883_01_04_293">H. R. 293</ref>]
                concerning Mutual Life Insurance Companies, under a suspension of the Constitutional
                rule by a two-thirds vote, was read second time by title.</p>

              <p>Mr. SAYRE explained-under this bill such Companies shall not be organized until
                after having secured $200,000 policies on lives a prerequisite-their policy holders
                are to be secured by a bead deposited with the Auditor of State. It makes it
                unlawful to solicit insurance upon the lives of aged and infirm persons. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE referred to several bad provisions in the bill.</p>

              <p>Mr. WILLARD objected to Section 6, and proposed several amendments to do away with
                a dodge or catch in the bill. He is informed that a clerical error noticed in the
                House on the third reading is still in the bill as reported to the Senate, and one
                amendment is to correct that.</p>

              <p> Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question. </p>

              <p> The Senate seconded the demand, and under the operation the amendments were
                rejected.</p>

              <p> The bill was read the third time and passed by yeas, 36; nays, 10.</p>

              <p> On motion by Mr. McCLURE the two amendments to his Clarksville charter bill [<ref

              <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN the bill [H. R. 91] to provide for the relocation of County
                seats was taken up, the question being on concurrence in a Minority Committee report
                recommending that the bill be indefinitely postponed.</p>

              <p> The Senate concurred in the report by yeas, 26; nays, 14. So the bill was
                indefinitely postponed. </p>

              <head rend="center">FENCING OF RAILROADS.</head>

              <p>On motion by Mr. ADKISON his bill [S. 42] to require railroads to fence their
                lines, etc., was read the second time by title only under a suspension of the rules
                by a two-thirds vote, the question being on a minority report recommending the
                passage of the bill.</p>

              <p>Mr. YANCEY declared the bill proposes an impossibility. It is wrong and vicious and
                ought not to pass. Men living along the road could extort from the Railroad
                Companies, and then Railroad Companies can not fence their roads to the time set In
                the bill. He desired the people to deal fairly with the Railroad Companies as he
                would have the Railroad Companies deal with the people.</p>

              <p>Mr. MARVIN thought this the worst bill ever introduced in this Senate. The greatest
                expense to farmers is building fences. It is wrong to put, anybody to the expense of
                building fences except to fence in stock.</p>

              <p>Mr. ADKISON expected this bill would meet with opposition. For twenty-eight years
                the Wabash Valley Railroad has been running through some of the best corn fields in
                Wabash County, and the road promised to fence when they got the right of way.
                Twenty-eight years is surely time enough for them to fence this track. If there is a
                Railroad unable to fence its track they ought to sell out. </p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN the bill and reports were laid on the table. </p>

              <p>Mr. BELL introduced a bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_295">S. 295</ref>]

              <p>Mr. BELL stating it to be questionable whether all laws on this subject have not

                repealing the one approved day before yesterday. </p>

                and passed by yeas, 31; nays, 0, under a suspension of the Constitutional rule.</p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. VOYLES the Constitutional rule was suspended, and the bill [H. R.
                105] concerning change of venue from Justice to Superior Court was read twice by

              <p>Mr. SPANN pointed out what he regarded as a vicious principle in this bill. </p>

          <div type="section">
            <head rend="center">THE NEW STATE HOUSE.</head>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN called up the special order, being the bill [H. R. 466] supplemental to
              an act to authorize and provide for the erection of a new State House.</p>

            <p> Mr HAM moved that the bill and amendments be indefinitely postponed. </p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, was of the opinion that this is an effort to hand over
              unfinished to dilapidation and decay the new State House. This means to add not less
              than $200,000 and probably $1,000,000 extra expense to the State House before it is
              completed. It means a delay in the completion of the building of from two to five
              years. It means to take from the State of Indiana at least $1,000,000. It means to
              leave idle $1,000,000 in the State Treasury. It means legislation to the damage of the
              people, and not in the interest of the people or the State He desired to eater a
              protest, not on the Journal, but a protest in debate against this action, and he would
              leave it for the future to determine whether or not he had protested wisely as to the
              consequence of this legislation should it be passed. He had not been asleep, he was
              not blind, he was not deaf, and he would give this a the sequence of what will follow. </p>

            <p>Mr GIBSON would not grant that the gentleman from Tippecanoe [Mr. Smith] was not
              asleep on this question. He desired to say to him that just such speeches were made in
              the House two years ago. The gentleman from Knox (Mr. Williams] championed these men
              two years ago when they said they would throw up this contract if the Legislature did
              not grant them an additional appropriation of $500,000, and the foundation would be
              left open to the ravages of the weather for the next two years When the members of the
              Investigating Committee asked Mr. Howard if he would put any more money in the
              building he avoided the question, and would not answer until chased in to a corner,
              and then he said he would not. These contractors do not need any more money, for under
              the present law they can draw 90 per cent. of the price of their work as soon as the
              estimate is made. </p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON moved the previous question, which was seconded by the House, and under
              its operations-</p>

            <p>The motion to postpone indefinitely was agreed to by the House-yeas, 49; nays, 45-as

            <p>The bill [S. 236] to fix commutations of terms of sentences on account of good
              behavior of persons confided in the State's Prisons, was read the third time.</p>

            <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, considered this one of the most humane bills that has been
              before the Legislature, and was heartily in favor of its passage. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, agreed with the gentleman from Tippecanoe [Mr. Smith], but he
              questioned the legality of such a measure.</p>

            <p>Mr. BOSTON stated that the bill was prepared by the explain of the Northern Prison,
              together with the Warden. He talked with quite a number of the convicts, and there was
              not one of them who did not desire the passage of the bill. The officers of the Prison
              believe that the bill will do snore to further good discipline than anything else that
              could be done. </p>

            <p>Mr. GILMAN believed that the provisions of the bill are good-that it is in the
              interest of reformation. The discipline of Prisons as now as administered has a
              tendency to degrade the inmates instead of making them better. He thought the men who
              drafted the bill entitled to honor. </p>

            <p>Mr. GIBSON thought if there is any one thing to be regretted in regard to our Prisons
              it is the severe discipline that is sometimes necessary to administer. He had
              converged with the Wardens of both Prisons on this subject, and they desire the
              passage of the bill.</p>

            <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 93; nays, 0.</p>

            <p>The bill [S. 278] supplemental to an act concerning drainage-see page 187-approved
              March 9, 1875, was read the third time and passed the House by yeas, 68; nays, 11.</p>

            <p>The bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_293">S. 293</ref>] to authorize the payment of

            <head rend="center">FREE GRAVEL ROADS.</head>

            <p>The bill [S. 98] to provide for the appraisement, purchase and conversion of toll
              roads into free gravel roads and their maintenance as free roads, was read the third
              time.</p>

            <p>Mr. ANTRIM: This if called an act for the establishment of free gravel reads, but it
              strikes me that it if- establishing them at a great cost to a portion of the people
              living along the road. This propose-; that the Gravel Road Companies, when the holders
              of the stock find that it is not a paying investment, may unload that stock upon the
              people who live on that road. These people have helped to build the road; they have
              paid to keep up the road, and it is not fair to force this road upon them after it
              fails to pay expenses While the road does pay the majority of the stockholders will
              not agree to give up the road. This bill requires the citizens living within one mile
              of the road to buy the road for he benefit of the whole County. It is easily seen that
              poisons living two or more miles from this road will be benefited just as much by
              making this a free road as person living one-fourth of a mile from this road. There is
              usually a large number of small property owners living along these roads where tax is
              merely nominal, and such persons would willingly petition the stockholders to sell the
              road. Another thing, while this road is in the hands of the stockholders they are
              compelled to keep it in repair, but when it goes into the hands of the County it
              becomes everybody's business to keep it in repair and what is everybody's business is
              nobody's business. </p>

            <p>Mr. WILSON, of Marion, declared this a fair bill. There is no compulsion about the
              matter. If a majority of persons living along the road desire it, it simply gives the
              right for such persons to purchase this road provided that the majority of the
              stockholders desire to sell. This is good Democratic doctrine. It gives these people
              the right to go into Court and have the Court decide whether the estimate placed upon
              the road is a fair estimate of the real value. Every free gravel road is built upon
              the principle that, the gentleman from Miami [Mr. Antrim] attacks, and is the
              principle on which all free gravel roads are built. The law is as fair and reasonable
              as can be devised for the transferring of gravel toll roads into free gravel roads. </p>

            <p>Mr. KESTER could see no danger in buying roads as directed in this bill if the
              majority of the people living along the road desired to do so, and the majority of the
              stockholders desire to sell. This bill ought to pass. </p>

            <p>Mr STRAUGHAN believed it was almost a demand that same law should be passed allowing
              these toll roads to be converted into free gravel roads. In his County they had some
              ninety miles of toll road. The business is being driven from the County seat, because
              it is completely hedged in by these toll roads, the business going to other points. He
              was in favor of the passage of the bill. </p>

            <p>Mr. MELLETT stated that if he understood the bill right it requires persons living
              along and, within one mile of the road to pay a Tax in order to buy this road. Now
              suppose this is a good law will it be appropriated? Will these men who have paid a tax
              to build the road-will these men buy this road and turn in over to the County as a
              free gift? It occurred to him that these men would petition these stock holders to
              sell the road. In the first place these men are taxed to build this road, and no man
              will say that it is just to tax them again to buy the road. </p>

            <p>Mr. THOMAS moved the previous question, which was seconded, by the House and under
              its operations.</p>

            <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 69; nays, 19 </p>

              <head rend="center"> COMMISSIONERS OF THE SUPREME COURT.</head>

              <p> The bill [<ref target="#SB_1883_01_04_174">S. 174</ref>] concerning the Supreme
                Court Commission for two years was read the third time. </p>

              <p>Mr. McMULLEN thought that this bill ought not to pass. Since the bill was up the
                other day he had taken the time to examine the facts concerning this Supreme Court
                Commission and its work for the past two years. He found that the Supreme Court
                decided during the two years beginning January 1, 1879, and ending January 1, 1881,
                1,251 cases, and that during the two years beginning January 1, 1881, and ending
                January 1. 1883, it has disposed of only 1,138 cases, or 113 cases less than for the
                same period of time before the Commission was appointed. The Commission has disposed
                of only 714 cases since appointed. Take from this the difference between 1,251 cases
                which the Supreme Court decided in two years before the Commission was appointed,
                and 1,138 cases which the Supreme Court has disposed of in two years since the
                Commission was appointed, and we find that th Supreme Court Commission has only
                disposed of 601 cases more than were disposed of by the Supreme Court. This
                Commission has proved rather an expensive luxury. He thought it should not be
                continued any longer; he was opposed to it.</p>

              <p>Mr. TULEY believed it was admitted on all hands that something ought to be done to
                relieve the Supreme Court. According to the admission of the gentleman from Dearborn
                [Mr. McMullen] the number of cases has been greatly reduced. He thought the
                Commission had done well to dispose of 714 cases. A few years ago if you sent a case
                to the Supreme Court you knew it would keep it for three or four years since the
                Commission was appointed, he had known cases to be decided in three mouths The House
                had already decided upon the Court of Appeals. It has spoken in unmistakable terms
                that we do not want that Court. It is just this: we must have that Commission or
                nothing. He believed the people demand it, and that the Supreme Court demands; it
                under all circumstances he believed the bill should pass and continue this
                Commission for two years more </p>

              <p>Mr. MOCK did not think we should determine the amount of work the Commission had
                done by the number of cases it had disposed of. The test he applied, and which he
                considered a fair one, is this: He was creditably informed that the number of
                volumes of Supreme Court Reports would greatly exceed the number issued during the
                year previous to the creation of this Commission. He considered this a just and fair
                test of the amount of work accomplished by this Commission. The difference between
                twenty-five volumes of the same size and number of pages and seventeen volumes, show
                the amount of work accomplished by this Commission. He believed that the Commission
                should be continued for two years, and trusted that the members would vote for this
                bill. </p>

              <p>Mr. SHIVELY said: It seems to me that we should sometime awaken to the fact that
                Indiana has become a great State. It ought to occur to any man that the Supreme
                Court can not discharge this business without some assistance. It is burdened, and
                has been for a number of years. It is said this Commission has not done satisfactory
                work, but, notwithstanding this assertion, they have done good work. Now, will we so
                to work and defeat the bill for the establishment of a Court of Appeals and also
                refuse to continue this Commission. It seems to me that it ought not to be done. It
                has been stated that they bay only disposed of 714 cases. This is no test. They can
                and will work better in the next two year than in the past. Then, you can not
                determine the efficiency of the work by the number of cases. We should not refuse to
                continue this for the next two years.</p>

              <p>Mr. MONTGOMERY thought it was a fact recognized by all members on the floor, he
                presumed, that the Supreme Court can not keep up with the business While this
                Commission may not have accomplished as much as was expected of it, yet something
                must be done for the relief of the Supreme Court, in order that it may catch up with
                its business, Ha thought this Commission should be continued two years longer. </p>

              <p>Mr WILSON, of Marion, was in real earnestness in his opposition to this Supreme
                Court Commission. It might not be good policy on his part, but he was opposed to
                this bill </p>

              <p>Mr. MOODY spoke in favor of the bill. He thought it was a matter of justice to the
                people that this Commission should be continued for the next two years, and
                therefore the question of expense raised by the gentleman from Marion [Mr. Wilson]
                should not be taken into consideration </p>

              <p>Mr. JEWETT thought the question has been fully considered, and demanded the
                previous question, which was seconded by the House, and under the operations
                thereof-</p>

              <p>The bill passed the House by yeas, 57; nays, 35. </p>

            <head rend="center">JOHNSTON AND OVERSTREET CONTEST.</head>

            <p>Mr. BELL offered a resolution for allowance of expenses in the Overstreet versus
              Johnson contested election case, being a total to Reuben M. Johnson of $1,310.</p>

            <pb n="293" xml:id="VAA8558-21-292"/>

            <p> Mr. MAGEE moved to amend by reducing the amount to $500.</p>

            <p>Mr BROWN entered a substitute for the amendment and resolution allowing $500 in
              addition to mileage and per diem.</p>

            <p>It was rejected.</p>

            <p>Mr. VOYLES said the Senate would not be justified in allowing as much as is proposed
              by the Committee resolution. It is true the center tor prosecuted the suit in good
              faith, but the items as set forth in the Committee report are too extensive. </p>

            <p> Mr. MAGEE also thought the charges are outrageous and unjustifiable, and for one
              should vote against the resolution, and entered a protest against appropriating any
              such sum of money. When a man runs for office he takes his chances of being elected,
              and ought not to ask the State to pay the expenses of a contest, especially when the
              majority report says there was no good ground for a contest.</p>

            <p> Mr. YOUCHE opposed the resolution, not believing it right to allow these expenses.
              If it was for the purpose of paying the expenses of one who had the right in the
              contest, it might be proper to pay the expenses, because under the rules that obtain
              in a Court of Justice the party gaining the case recovers from the other party. Yet
              this resolution asks that the State shall come in and for the purpose of encouraging
              the contest should put her hand in the pocket and pay the cost of the unsuccessful
              candidate. If this thing is to be encouraged the same rule ought to apply to every man
              who holds an elective office. The law expressly provides in case of County officers,
              where a man makes a contest and is unsuccessful is obligated not only to pay his own
              case, but also the man against whom the contest is made.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN never was and never would be in favor of paying two persons for occupying
              one seat in a legislative body. The report of the Committee adopted the other day
              provides that this contestor shall be paid mileage and per diem, and he moved to amend
              the amendment by allowing him the sum of $500, and no more.</p>

            <p> Mr. FOULKE favored this amendment. He protested against awarding compensation for
              three attorneys when one is ample for the purpose, and one should have attended to
              this case from the beginning to the end for the sum of $500.</p>

            <p> Mr. ADKISON suggested $200 would be enough.</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY was willing to vote for that much, though the proposition of the Senator
              from Cass is nearer than any of them.</p>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY also thought that the fairest amendment offered. He opposed allowing
              anything beyond mileage and per diem.</p>

            <p> Mr. ADKISON moved to make the allowance $200.</p>

            <p> Mr. Henry moved, as a substitute for the amendment and the resolution, $500 in full
              for per diem and expenses.</p>

            <p> Mr. BELL thought it not right to talk about paying the reasonable expenses of this
              contest with the insignificant sum of $140. There is a principle upon which such
              action as is proposed is based; and that is to allow the expenses of a contest. It has
              been acted upon in Congress from time immemorial. Men ought to be encouraged to make a
              good contest. A contest for a County office holds out a much greater prize. Men run
              for that office for the money that is in it. Such circumstances don't attend this
              office. We are all interested in seeing any contest that seems to be fair carried. </p>

            <p> Mr. JOHNSON considered this mileage and per diem is allowed for the very purpose of
              reimbursing the contestant for expenses incurred n the contest. Certainly the
              contestant has not rendered any service. If the sum is made $500, this Senate has done
              ample justice to the contestant.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN considered $140 as nothing like a fair compensation for counsel fees in
              this case. The depositions were volumulens-about 2,300 pages. Before he would vote the
              poor, miserable, cringing sum of $140 to pay counsel fees, he would not vote a
              farthing.</p>

            <p> Mr. BENZ didn't know anything about fixing the price of lawyer fees; only we
              oughtn't to pay Cropsey for loafing around here this winter, and that is what he wants
              to get pay for, not for contesting this case. </p>

            <p> The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Then you don't want to pay him very bad.</p>

            <p> Mr. BENZ: No I don't.</p>

            <p> Mr. BROWN'S heart was made sick when he moved to amend so that the compensation for
              legal service shall be $250.</p>

            <p> Mr. SAYRE hoped the Senate would stand by the report of the Committee adopted the
              other day. The Committee find that the services are richly worth the prices charged.
              The report of the Committee as made to the Senate should be adopted without
              amendment.</p>

            <p> Mr. FOULKE thought he would favor the $500, but failing in that, thought $250 should
              be allowed.</p>

            <p> Mr. MAGEE withdrew his amendment.</p>

            <p> On motion by Mr. BROWN the substitute resolution was amended by increasing the
              amount to $610.</p>

            <p> The substitute resolution, as amended by Mr. Brown's motion, so as as to make the
              total sum $610, was adopted by yeas, 80; nays, 11.</p>

            <p> Pending the roll-call, in explanation of votes-</p>

            <p> Mr. BELL voted for it because it increases the sum slightly; it is wholly inadequate
              and unfair nevertheless. </p>

            <p> Mr. BENZ remembered a contest six years ago that cost only $79. I can't see why in
              the dickens we are to pay lawyers for loafing around here abusing people. I vote "aye"
              all the time. [Laughter.] </p>

            <p> Mr. BUNDY didn't think the contestant entitled to mileage and per diem. He voted
              "aye." </p>

            <p> Mr. FAULKNER knew nothing about the fees charged-whether they were high or low-but
              he did know he would never vote to pay them one cent. He vote "no."</p>

            <p> Mr. HENRY voted for the amendment in preference to the original resolution,
              reserving the right to vote against it as amended.</p>

            <p> Mr. LOCKRIDGE stood by the majority report adopted by the Senate which allows the
              contestor mileage and reasonable expenses. The per diem is $369. This amendment leaves
              for expenses and attorneaeys' fees $250, which is a very reasonable fee. Therefore, he
              voted, "aye."</p>

            <p> Mr. OVERSTREET asked to be excused from voting, but Mr. Bell objecting, he voted
              "aye," regarding $500 as reasonable.</p>

            <p> Mr. SAYRE believing this sum not enough for reasonable expenses and attorneys' fees,
              voted "no."</p>

            <p> Mr. VAN VORHIS voted for the amendment, reserving the right to vote afterward as he
              pleased.</p>

            <p> Mr. VOYLES, believing this to be about as near as could be arrived at by mutual
              agreement, voted "aye."</p>

            <p> Mr. YOUCHE thought nothing should be allowed the contestant, because he did not make
              the contest good.</p>

            <p> The vote was then announced as above.</p>

            <p> So the resolution, as amended, was adopted.</p>

            <p> The resolution reported by the Committee as amended was concurred in by yeas, 28;
              nays, 14.</p>

            <p> Pending the roll-call-in explanation,</p>

            <p> Mr. ADKISON: Inasmuch as the Senator from Allen and Whitley [Mr. Bell] and the
              Senator from Marion [Mr. Van Vorhis] failed to stand up to the first proposition in
              the Committee report, he would not stand up to the second. Therefore he voted
              "no."</p>

            <p> Mr. KEISER voted for the resolution on the ground that the Senate has heretofore
              decided that Mr. Johnson, the contestant, should have per diem and reasonable
              expenses. The expenses, as fixed in this resolution, are reasonable; therefore he
              voted "aye."</p>

            <p> Mr. McCULLOUGH ordinarily could not under<pb n="294" xml:id="VAA8558-21-293"/>stand
              why the expenses of an unsuccessful contestor should be paid, but in this case he
              thought the contestor made out his contest, and for that reason is entitled to
              expenses, since the report <unclear reason="printing error?">declaring</unclear> the
              contestee entitled to the seat was adopted the Senate is bound in honor to pay these
              expenses; therefore he voted, "aye," believing them reasonable or even below
              reasonable. </p>

            <p>The vote was announced as above.</p>

            <p>So the resolution reported by the Committee, as amended by the substitute resolution,
              was adopted. </p>

            <p>Mr BUNDY moved that J. A. West. C. A. Gal- breath, Joseph Friedman and Robert Newland

              <p> Mr. JOHNSON offered the following: </p>

              <floatingText>
                <body>
                  <div type="resolution">
                    <p>Whereas, From all sections and from nearly every County, the State petitions
                      have come to this General Assembly praying for the abolition of the present
                      system of hiring out the labor of convicts of our Penitentiaries and the
                      inmates of our Reform Schools and Benevolent Institutions, under contract to
                      the highest bidder. </p>

                    <p>Whereas, A bill passed by the Senate for the regulation of said convict labor
                      aims only at modifying the present system, but falls short of abolishing it
                      and applying the proper remedy for its evil and abuses; and,</p>

                    <p>Whereas, The short time of the legislative section prevented this General
                      Assembly from finding the proper remedy for this system, which is admitted to
                      be pernicious to the interests of Indiana manufacturers and Indiana mechanics
                      and workingmen,</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That Committee of three Senators holding over for the General
                      Assembly of 1885 be appointed by the President of the Senate to prepare a bill
                      abolishing the present system of convict labor and substitute a system of
                      employment for the convicts of our Penitentiaries, and the Inmates of our
                      Reformatory School and Benevolent Institutions which will not come in
                      competition with Indiana manufacturers.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That the members of said Committee of three Senators shall not be

              <p> The resolution was adopted and the Lieutenant Governor makes the Committee to

              <p> On motion by Mr. SPANN a Committee of Two-Messrs. Spann and Magee-were appointed
                to wait on the Governor and ascertain whether Hit Excellency has any further

              <p>The Committee soon returned and reported the Governor has no further communication

              <p>On motion by Mr. YANCEY the concurrent resolution of the House authorizing a

                Dumb, was concurred in by the Senate.</p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE offered a resolution declaring it the opinion of the Senate that the
                action of the House of Representatives, in failing, without sufficient reason, to
                pass the general appropriation bill during the time allotted for the present regular
                session, is injurious to the best interests of the people.</p>

              <p>Mr. VOYLES raised the point of order that this resolution is out of order, because
                it attempts to criticise a co-ordinate branch of the General Assembly.</p>

              <p>The PRESIDENT pro tem. [Mr. Bundy in the Chair] overruled the point of order. </p>

                minutes after another message announced that the Speaker had signed said bill.</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN-made an ineffectual motion-yeas, 18; nays, 26-that the Senate adjourn
                sine die. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE claiming the floor-</p>

              <p>Mr. YANCEY offered a resolution, which was rejected-yeas, 18; nays, 26-that John L.
                Patterson, Deputy Clerk, be allowed $1 per day extra.</p>

              <p>Mr CAMPBELL, explaining his negative vote, said: Upon every proposition which has
                been made to-day for the payment of additional wages to the employes of this Senate
                I have voted "no." and shall continue to vote "no." I grant that so far as I know
                the officers of this Senate may have done their work well; certainly they have been
                courteous and attentive, but in voting money as a public officer I know of no
                principle by which to be governed except by the same equity and integrity A I would
                be in my private business. These employes have sought these positions with the
                knowledge of the wages paid, which I may add is in all cases nearly if not quite
                double what they would get in other positions. <pb n="295" xml:id="VAA8558-21-294"/>
                As a, business proposition for personal services not a Senator upon this floor would
                think of making this additional payment at the expiration of the service, and yet
                hundreds of dollars have to-day been voted with as much freedom as though the
                people's money came without burden to them and is to be cared for without
                responsibility on our part. Men have been voted $6 per day for duties that as a
                business proposition, no Senator upon this floor would have paid more than $l per
                day for, and could have got it well done for less than that. I see no ground of
                equity or integrity for doing this, and hence, as I nave been doing all day, I still
                vote "no." </p>

              <p>Mr. MAGEE offered a resolution that the thanks of this Senate are hereby tendered
                James Gordon Bennett for his magnificent contribution to the fund for the relief of
                the sufferers occasioned by the recent floods of the Ohio and Wabash Rivers, and
                that the secretary of this Senate be authorized to transmit to Mr. Bennett a copy of
                this resolution. </p>

              <p>The resolution was adopted. </p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. VOYLES it was laid on the table. </p>

              <p>On motion by Mr. HENRY it was laid on the table. </p>

              <p>Mr. McINTOSH making an ineffectual motion to lay it on the table</p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE still claiming the floor-</p>

              <p>Mr. BROWN insisted that the Democratic party on the floor of the Senate should keep
                still and allow the Senator from Wayne [Mr. Foulke], who seems to be trying to out
                Herod the Senator from Rush, to crack his whip and lash it over our backs just as
                much as he pleases, because if there ever was a set of folks in the Senate lathed,
                in weapon and out of season, it has been the Republican members of this Senate. </p>

              <p>Mr. FOULKE, still claiming the floor, gave way for-</p>

              <p>Mr. SPANN, who moved that the Senate adjourn sine die. </p>

          </dateline>

          <p>The House was called to order by Mr. Speaker Bynum, who announced prayer by
            Representative Frazee, of Rush County.</p>

          <p>A call of the House, which was ordered and taken, discovered ninety-two members present
            and answering to their names.</p>

          <p>The SPEAKER stated the question before the House was the appeal taken from the decision
            of the Chair, on Saturday, March 3, when he ruled out of order Mr. Kester's motion to
            take up the general appropriation bill [H. R. 302], and concur in the report of the
              <orgName>Free Conference Committee</orgName>.</p>

          <p>Mr. JEWETT: He had examined the question since that time and did not desire to press
            the question, and with the consent of the gentleman from Putnam [Mr. Gordon], who joined
            in the appeal, be would withdraw it. </p>

          <p>Mr. GORDON stated that a the opportunity had passed for accomplishing the object aimed
            at, he was also desirous to withdraw the appeal.</p>

          <p>The SPEAKER stated that the appeal being withdrawn the question recurred on the passage
            of the bill [S. 247] to provide for the the profitable hiring of the convict in the
            State's Prisons.</p>

          <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, raised the point of order that Senate bill 217 can not now be
            put upon its passage for the reason that Section 14, Article 5, of the Constitution
            provides that no bill "hall be presented to the Governor within two days next preceding
            the final adjournment of the General Assembly. </p>

          <p>The SPEAKER ruled the point of order not well taken and that the House could pass the
            bill at the present time, but could not under the Constitution present it to the
            Governor. </p>

          <p>Mr. McMULLEN thought the point of order made by the gentleman fr* m Tippecanoe [Mr.
            Smith] WAS not well taken. He took the position that the House could pass the till, and
            in case of an extra session, arguing from the standpoint that we do not know that there
            will not be a session to-morrow, the bill could then be presented for his signature or
            veto. He took the ground that under the Constitution no bill could be presented to the
            Governor for two days next preceding the final adjournment, but that bills could be
            passed up to the final adjournment. </p>

          <p>Mr. JEWETT thought in the consideration of his question the House should proceed with
            great deliberation. The Constitution provides that no bill shall be presented to the
            Governor for two days next preceding the final adjournment of the General Assembly. He
            did not like to see a plain provision of the Constitution overridden in this way. He did
            not desire to put the Governor in this dilemma of having a bill presented to him at this
            late day-he would take that back, he would wish to put him in any dilemma, seeing the
            dilemma in which he had placed the other House of this General Assembly. It would be
            establishing a most dangerous precedent, as if the Governor should accept the bill, it
            would establish the rule that the Governor and a majority of the Legislature when they
            agreed might substantially decide what bills should or should not become law. He
            objected to asking the Governor to establish any such precedent </p>

          <p>Mr. SHIVELY desired to inquire into the statue of this bill. It occurred to him that
            any action now would be totally at fault. He thought it had been regarded by all Central
            Assemblies since the Constitution was adopted that the legislative day expired on
            Saturday night at 12 o'clock. He believed it was the first time In the history of the
            State since the Constitution was adopted that any attempt has been made to pass bi'ls
            and do legislation on the last day of the session. The Constitution says that no bill
            shall be presented to the Governor within two days of the final adjournment, and when we
            send a bill there we would be trampling upon the Constitution and be in contempt of our
            oaths. </p>

          <p>Mr. SMITH, of Tippecanoe, desired to say that the Constitution is above all other
            authority-that any provision of the statutes concerning the business of the General
            Assembly could not take precedent of the Constitution. He agreed with the remark made by
            the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Heffren] when he said last Saturday that it was the
            last day in which bills could be presented to the Governor. </p>

          <p>Mr. Speaker BYNUM [Mr. McMullen in the Chair] thought the provisions of the
            Constitution harmonize in all particulars. The question of passing a bill and the
            question of presenting a bill to the Governor are two different matters entirely. He
            thought it would be wrong to present a bill at this time, still he did not think that
            the legislative power of this body ceased Saturday night at 12 o'clock. The only
            question now is whether or not we have power to pass this bill. </p>

          <p>Mr. GORDON was a member of the <orgName>Enrolling Committee</orgName> whose duty it was
            to present bills to the Governor, and he now desired to know if it <pb n="296"
              xml:id="VAA8558-21-295"/> would not be their duty to present this bill to the Governor
            should it be passed by the House.</p>

          <p> Messrs. FRAZER and ADAMS now sent up an appeal from the decision of the Chair, in
            which they set forth the point of order made by Mr. Smith, of Tippecanoe, and made the
            rule of the Chair on that point.</p>

          <p> Mr. SPEAKER BYNUM [Mr. Gordon in the Chair] did not desire to be misunderstood. His
            opposition was simply this: He did not see anything in the Constitution limiting the
            power of this Legislature in the passage of bills up to the last hour. He did not know
            whether or not there was any precedent upon this question. The provision of the
            Constitution which says that no bill shall be presented to the Governor within two days
            next preceding the final adjournment does not prevent this House from passing bills
            during that time.</p>

          <p> Mr. ADAMS (interrupting) asked the question does a certain section of the Constitution
            provide that no bill shall be presented to the Governor within two days of the final
            adjournment; and does it not further provide that all bills passed shall be presented to
            the Governor?</p>

          <p> Mr. BYNUM (resuming): Certainly; all bills passed up to the time of limitation must be
            presented. He argued that the bill might be passed, and could be presented to the
            Governor, in the event of his calling a special session.</p>

          <p> Mr. FRAZER thought this question would be referred to by coming Legislatures as a
            precedent. He hoped that the members would turn to the Constitution and examine it that
            they might vote knowingly upon this question. The Constitution provides that every bill
            passed by the General Assembly shall be presented to the Governor. It further says that
            no bill shall be presented to him for the two days next preceding the final adjournment.
            The only order given by this House that a bill shall be presented to the Governor is the
            passage of that bill. If we pass this bill to-day we thereby give order and power to
            this <orgName>Enrolling Committee</orgName> to present this bill to the Governor. He
            agreed with the gentleman from Clark and Scott [Mr. Jewett] when he said this would be
            establishing a dangerous precedent.</p>

          <p> Mr. WILSON, Kosciusko, argued the question from the same standpoint as the gentleman
            who had just finished.</p>

          <p> Mr. McMULLEN contented that whether this General Assembly met again or not the passage
            of this bill would be binding, and the next General Assembly might and should present it
            to the Governor two years from now, if it did not reach him before.</p>

          <p> Mr. ADAMS was of the opinion that if we should construe the Constitution as the
            gentleman from Dearborn [Mr. McMullen] had suggested we would have to admit that the
            Convention which assembled thirty years ago authorized the General Assembly to do
            something that could never mature into a law. The Constitution provides that no bill be
            presented to the Governor for the two days next preceding the final adjournment, and
            that all bills shall be presented to him. It simply means, if it means anything in the
            world, that the General Assembly shall not pass bills on the last two days of the
            session. If it means anything else it would be giving the General Assembly to do
            something that could never mature into a law. It would be a mere farce. The Constitution
            was clear that the General Assembly could not pass bills after the time had expired for
            the bills passed becoming law. He was certain that the next General Assembly would have
            nothing to do with bills passed by the present General Assembly that had failed to
            become law. </p>

          <p> Mr. HEFFREN thought the question had been fully discussed and demanded the previous
            question, which he withdrew with the understanding that the vote would be immediately
            taken upon the appeal from the decision of the Chair.</p>

          <p> The question being shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the House?
            the vote resulted, yeas, 47; nays, 43 so the decision of the Chair was sustained.</p>

          <p> A message was received from the Governor announcing that he had returned the bill [H.
            R. 133], the metropolitan police bill, with his veto.</p>

          <p> The question recurring on the passage of the bill [H. R. 247] the bill was rejected by
            the House by yeas, 24; nays, 59. </p>

            <p>Mr. HEFFREN moved to take up the message from the Governor on the bill [H. R. 133]
              the metropolitan police bill. The motion was agreed to.</p>

            <p> The message was read as follows:</p>

                    <salute>Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:</salute>
                  </opener>

                  <p>I return to you, with my objections thereto, House bill No. 133, commonly known
                    as the metropolitan police bill. </p>

                  <p>The bill declares that, in cities of this State containing 29,000 or more
                    inhabitants, according to the United States Census of 1880, there shall be
                    established a Board of Metropolitan Police, to consist of three Commissioners,
                    to be appointed by the Governor, and the Secretary, Auditor and Treasurer of
                    State. One of the Commissioners shall be of "opposite politics" to the other
                    two. It provides that these Commissioners shall have power to appoint a
                    Superintendent of Police, Captains, Sergeants, Detectives and such other
                    officers and patrolmen as they may deem advisable, to be appointed equally
                    between the two political parties. The number of patrolmen is limited to one for
                    each thousand inhabitants. No limit whatever is placed upon the number of
                    Captains, Sergeants and Detectives. Though they might be made so numerous to
                    gratify party or personal favorites, as to impose a most unjust burden upon the
                    City Treasury, the voters of the city can do nothing to regulate this
                    number.</p>

                  <p> There are but two cities in the State the population of which is shown by the
                    census of 1880 exceeds 29,000 inhabitants. They are Indianapolis and Evansville,
                    the City Governments of which have been, except during great intervals, in the
                    control of officers holding different political opinions from a majority of the
                    members of the General Assembly.</p>

                  <p> Fort Wayne, by the census of 1880, contained a population of nearly 29,000
                    inhabitants. The City Government of Fort Wayne is steadily under the control of
                    officers who agree with the majority of the members of the two Houses of the
                    Legislature in political opinions. Fort Wayne is not included within the
                    provisions of the bill. Nor are any of those provisions of the bill which its
                    advocates claim are necessary for good municipal government and fair elections
                    made applicable to that city either by the bill itself or by any other bill
                    which has been before the present Legislature. It is evident, therefore, that
                    the design is for merely party reasons, to deprive the citizens of Indianapolis
                    and of Evansville of the power, through officers chosen by themselves, to
                    appoint their police. </p>

                  <p> That these are the controlling reasons is placed beyond doubt by the mode
                    provided for selecting the Commissioners of Police. Instead of appointing two or
                    four officers equally divided in political opinion to make the selection, three
                    State officers differing in political opinion from the Governor are appointed
                    along with him to make the choice. These are officers, too who unlike the
                    Governor, are eligible, under the Constitution, to re-election at the end of
                    their present terms and who, naturally desirous of being re-elected, may well be
                    supposed, without meaning to judge them with any disrespect, to be peculiarly
                    susceptible of party bias.</p>

                  <p> The Commissioners to be selected are not required to be equally divided in
                    political opinion, <pb n="297" xml:id="VAA8558-21-296"/>, but are to consist of
                    three persons, one of whom shall be of "opposite politics" from the other two.
                    It is well known, of course, from the composition of the Board chosen to appoint
                    them, of what politics the majority of the Commissioners will be, and the member
                    required to be of "opposite politics" need not, under the terms of the bill, be
                    a member even of one of the two leading political parties. He may belong to any
                    party opposed in opinion to the majority of the Commissioners, no matter how
                    inconsiderable maybe its numbers.</p>

                  <p>The Commissioners are required, in appointing the officers and men who shall
                    compose the police, to appoint "equally between the political parties."</p>

                  <p>This fair-sounding phrase will deceive nobody acquainted with the courses of
                    parties. If men are to be chosen as policemen Impartially, the men who choose
                    them must be impartial. When no careful provision is made that it shall not be
                    impartial, it is easy to foresee what will be the real party composition of the
                    police. Those who agree In political opinion with a majority of the
                    Commissioners will be bold, aggressive partisans; those who do not will, for the
                    most part, be likely to be persona of weak political convictions, and will be
                    afraid to utter their sentiments lest by doing so they may lose their places. </p>

                  <p>The citizens of Evansville and Indianapolis are by this bill to be deprived of
                    the political rights which belong to the citizens of Fort Wayne because a
                    majority of their inhabitants chance to differ in political opinion from a
                    majority of the members of the General Assembly. This majority, claiming to be
                    members of a party favoring popular rights, propose to set the first example in
                    this State of depriving the people of a right to regulate their own law affairs.
                    They have found out, as they suppose, a better way of educating the people for
                    the duty of self-government than by confiding to them the management v of their
                    own local concerns. They are better pleased it would seem, with the aristocratic
                    forms which give to others than the people the right to determine what is best
                    for the people I refuse to subscribe to such views. The best Governments have
                    faults, but the best Government, in the long run, in that which confides to the
                    people the greatest power in regulating their local affairs. </p>

                  <p>The best way to cure the evils of bad local administration, where such evils
                    exist, is to make the people affected by them fell that they will suffer from
                    them until they exert themselves locally to remedy them. But especially I object
                    to the bill for several reasons. It is the beginning, if it shall pass into a
                    law, of party contests at each recurring Legislature to take cities out of the
                    control of the majority of the inhabitants when a majority in the Legislature
                    differ from them on party questions. Like the scheme to renew the old abuse of
                    giving to the Legislature the appointment of the Trustees of our Benevolent and
                    Reformatory Institutions, its inevitable effect will be to increase party
                    wrangling and frenzy up the two Houses, to make the real interests of the people
                    subordinate to party triumphs, and prolong the sessions of the Legislature
                    beyond the limit prescribed by the Constitution for regular sessions of that
                    body</p>

                  <p>The present session of the Legislature is an illustration of the effect of this
                    merely partisan legislation. The Constitution of the State gives to the Governor
                    three days exclusive of Sunday for the consideration of every bill after the day
                    it shall have been presented to him. It is a very brief time under ordinary
                    circumstances, but especially is it so when, as during the present session,
                    party strife has postponed the passage of nearly all legislation until the
                    closing hours of session. Bills enough are on my table properly to occupy at
                    least a fortnight in order to be considered with even reasonable care; yet,
                    because I have not been willing to waive my Constitutional right to deliver it
                    for the brief term of <unclear reason="ink smeared">three</unclear> days, upon
                    the provisions of the bill now returned, the two Houses refused to pass the
                    general appropriation bill. They have said in substance that they will not allow
                    the State Government to be carried on if they can prevent it, unless a
                    co-ordinate branch of the Government will yield to their will and surrender a
                    plain and mot necessary Constitutional right. </p>

                  <p>It is believed that, if this bill should become a law, the city of Indianapolis
                    will not be able, under the levy and assessment it is now allowed by law to
                    make, to meet its necessary expenses. The city is now operating under an
                    assessment as high as the law allows. The expense of the present police force is
                    stated to me by the Mayor to be $50,210 a year. The annual expense of the police
                    force provided for by the present bill will be, at a moderate estimate, as I am
                    assured by persons competent to judge, more than $80,000. </p>

                  <p>The fourteenth section of the bill now returned is in my opinion repugnant to
                    the Constitution. It requires that the fees fixed and allowed to City Marshals
                    "shall be taxed and allowed in all cases where the arrests are made or protests
                    served by any of the police force of said cities in favor of said city, and
                    shall be collected in the same manner as other costs are collected, and shall be
                    paid into the City Treasury of said city by the officer or party or person
                    collecting the same every three months" Section 12 of Article 1 of the
                    Constitution ordains that justice shall be administered "freely and without
                    purchase." In a case which arose under a statute giving a salary to Clerks and
                    Sheriffs and requiring them to pay all their fees and costs into the County
                    Treasury, Judge Worden said that "while it may be that litigants can be required
                    to pay docket fees or otherwise contribute to the support of the Judiciary in
                    such manner as might be provided by law, it is clear to my mind that they can
                    not be required through the medium of Clerks and Sheriffs nominally as for their
                    fees, to put money into the County Treasury which may be used for general
                    purposes, and as the condition upon which justice can be administered to the
                    litigating parties by the Courts of the State." The opinion of Judge Worden was
                    adopted as a true statement of the law in Fulk vs. Board of Commissioners of
                    Monroe County (46 Ind., 150.) Under that decision it appears that the
                    requirement that the fees allowed to Marshals shall be paid into the City
                    Treasury is unconstitutional.</p>

                  <p>For the several reasons above stated, I am constrained to return this bill
                    without my approval.</p>

            <p>Mr. Speaker BYNUM delivered the following valedictory: </p>

            <p>Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:</p>

            <p>Our labors are at an end. The present session has been one of special importance to
              the people. I congratulate you upon the faithful discharge of your duties. You have
              labored earnestly and diligently, and, although at times there has been excitement and
              division in your ranks upon some questions, upon all those which affected the people
              directly and universally, there has been but one desire and sentiment, and that was to
              formulate and enact the best laws in the briefest period. No member of this House
              should feel the slightest hesitation in saying we have assisted to accomplish a good
              work. We began our labors with many disadvantages. The Constitutional amendments were
              thrust upon us in the most complicated form. We were confronted with the proposition
              that unless an in increased price of more than a quarter of a million dollars was
              given to the State House contractors the building would be abandoned at a great loss
              to the State. Upon these we had to gather information and make up our minds, whether
              correctly or not remains a question. Deducting the time required for the consideration
              of these questions, we have assisted to enact more good and beneficent laws than any
              preceding House in the same length of time. We have assisted in the enactment of a law
              in relation to the settlement of decedents' estates which will prevent their being
              squandered in costs and fees; we have assisted to enact a road law universally
              demanded by the people in all parts of the State. We have assisted in the enactment of
              many other laws which are elss in importance only because of their local application.
              When your labors are laid before your constituents, and fully tested, I have no fears
              but what your labors will meet with their hearty approbation. As for myself, I can
              only say I have labored hard to advance your work. No person who has not occupied the
              position assigned me can realize the cares and labors it imposes. When chosen to
              preside over your deliberations, I felt that my elevation was to some extent a
              personal sacrifice. I accepted it with the firm intention of strictly enforcing the
              rules of the government and pressing legislative business as fast as possible. At
              times I may have seemed harsh and arbitrary, but nothing was farther from my thought
              or purpose. If I have done any member a wrong it was unintentional and caused by the
              excitement incident to legislative work. I have used my utmost endeavors to favor each

              felt a special interest, and only regret that I have not been able to accomplish more
              in this particular.</p>

              and return to you my thanks for assistance you have given me in the discharge of my
              duties and for the uniform kindness shown me. My relations with the officers of the
              House and their assistants have been pleasant throughout, and to them I also extend my
              thanks for the courteous manner in which they have at all times assisted me in my
              labors.</p>

                <salute>PROSPECTUS-To the 53rd General Assembly:</salute>
              </opener>

              <p>The undersigned proprietor of the <hi rend="sc">BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS</hi>
                respectfully represents That twenty-five years ago we organized and executed a plan
                of independent unpartizan Legislative Reporting (the first ever attempted west of
                the Alleghanies having regard to fullness and completeness as to the matter and the
                parliamentary forms) upon which we have printed our Reports at a cost to the State
                less by one-half than any similar job of the State's printing: That our work proved
                acceptable to the General Assembly and received acts for authorization and pay; That
                it has been maintained and has received similar acts of endorsement by every
                assembly except three; and we respectfully submit that under this usage of the
                General Assembly we have a fair constructive permission and invitation to continue
                our independent work of elaborating and offering the <hi rend="sc">BREVIER
                  REPORTS</hi>.</p>

              <p>The twenty-first volume of the <hi rend="sc">BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS</hi> of
                the Proceedings and Debates of the Indiana Legislature will embrace reliable
                short-hand sketches of the Journals, Proceedings and Debates of both Houses of the
                Fifty-3rd General Assembly of the State of Indiana, convened at Indianapolis city,
                in regular session, the 4th day of January, A. D. 1883. It will contain important
                motions, messages, resolutions and committee reports, that shall be made and
                submitted; it will describe or copy at length bills and weighty propositions that
                shall be presented and considered ; and it will afford liberal and verbatim sketches
                of the Debates,-presenting without partizan bias the position of every member on the
                floor, with the yeas and nays in every question of moment on which they shall be
                ordered and taken. </p>

              <p>The coming session will without doubt, be usually interesting, and the <hi
                  rend="sc">BREVIER REPORTS</hi> will be, as it has been for 25 years the only
                source from which reliable reports of the Debates of the Legislature can be
                obtained. This has been found to be the best and most economical means of presenting
                to the people an intelligible journal not only of what is done, but of <pb n="304"
                  xml:id="VAA8558-21-303"/> what is said in the General Assembly, together with a
                reliable account, in proper legislative forms, of the order of the doings and
                sayings of the representatives of the people. </p>

              <p>The undersigned submit that these Reports are indispensable to the history of
                legislation in the State, of great value to the people at large, especially to
                politicians, and every public man; and that their value is increased by time. </p>

              <p>We propose to pursue the publication of our <hi rend="sc">BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
                  REPORTS</hi>. But there is now this difficulty about our work: we are unable to
                contract with either of the morning papers in this city for the daily printing of
                our Reports of the Session in their newspaper. Therefore, since our Reports of the
                present Session cannot appear in the papers as heretofore, and to provide against
                the restrictions of space in the daily papers by which the reports are marred and
                excluded, we pro- pose to contract for printing outside of the daily press, so as to
                insure a complete and satisfactory record. These contracts involve an inevitable
                expense of money on our part, which is barely justified by the State's authorization
                of the purchase of the number of copies of the Reports which has been accord- ed for
                nineteen years in the Specific Bill or resolution nearly every Assembly since 1857-.
                The price is less than one-third which is paid by the States for the work of the
                Reporter of the Supreme Court.</p>

              <p>The past, we think, teaches plainly enough, that unless the General Assembly were
                to establish a special Bureau for Reporting and Printing, involving new offices and
                additional public expensivenesss, which should be avoided by all means consistent
                with reasonable carefulness for the information and welfare of the supervising
                people, our proposition, which has been accepted by the General Assembly for
                twenty-five years is the best, and certainly it is by very much the cheapest way to
                escape the evils of partial Reporting in the interest of rings and factions. We
                think, also, that the general acceptance of our Reports twenty-five years justifies
                the expectation that the Legislature will not now forego the advantages of these
                contributions to the history of its work. </p>

              <p>So, pledging diligence and fidelity for completeness and impartiality, larger space
                and improved facilities for printing, we hope you will regard it as respectful, and
                but the part of common prudence for us to ask of the present General Assembly for
                some expression, in advance, in favor of the continuance: of these Reports, upon
                which we may proceed with the printing of another-the 21st-volume of our
                Reports.</p>

        <head rend="center">BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.</head>
        <p>In this submission of the <hi rend="i">Brevier Reports</hi> we have not been mistaken as
          to the common and growing public demand for just and intelligent public records. We have
          tried to meet that demand, and to provoke parties abler than we are to supply it as it
          ought to be supplied. And we still suppose that the representatives of the people know
          what they want in this matter know whether it is better to do everything here at the
          Capitol by memory and word of mouth than to stand upon a fair and open record for history. </p>

        <p>We have proceeded strictly upon the presumption that the peopled representatives know
          what is due to the country and to themselves in this matter of a record of their
          legislative action. And if there is any consideration against the continuance of the <hi
            rend="i">Brevier</hi> except that of its cost, the same conceit is as much against the
          lobbies and open doors for the sessions of the General Assembly; and it is at least one
          hundred years too late for secret sessions.</p>

        <p> The work can not be done by jobbers for the money that has been paid for it; and as to
          the standing contract price of the work, it carries that on every page: for " two thirds
          of a cent a page per copy" it is furnished to the proper accounting officers of the State
          in printed sheets, <hi rend="i">procured in every item of its cost at our own
          expense</hi>.</p>

        <p>The Brevier Legislative Reports have been acceptable to the Legislature and the people
          for twenty-five years. The work has stood sternly on its merits with each particular
          session since '57 and it is offered again with the ability and desire on the part of these
          reporters to make such an abridgment of the State Legislative Record in the best form and
          at the cheapest rate. </p>

        <p>Considering the difficulties and opposition incident to such a work; the contingencies of
          failing health and failing purse, and failing at length to make an acceptable offering of
          the work, there is nothing in the offering of it on our part but hard work, and the good
          name of unswerving workers, much very delicate personal responsibility, and some pecuniary
          hazard-(large for our means-) and, last and at the best, but small pay.</p>

        <p>As seventeen consecutive sessions of the General Assembly have authorized the publication
          of the <hi rend="i">Brevier Reports</hi>, it is regarded respectful and a duty to continue
          a proffer of the service that has been acceptable to every Legislature for so many
          years.</p>

        <p>None in the State are so competent to make a Legislative Record as the projectors of the
            <hi rend="i">Brevier Reports</hi> because the lives of no other Indianians have been
          passed in such like Service. </p>
