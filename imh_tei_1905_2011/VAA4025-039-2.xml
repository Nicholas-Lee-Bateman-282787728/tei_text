            <byline>WILLIAM O. LYNCH</byline>
            <p>The name <hi rend="i">Indiana</hi> means Indian country. The term was first applied by a trading
                    company to a geographic district just east of the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> between the Monongahela and Little <geogName>Kanawha rivers</geogName>. A few years
                    later, in 1800, the same name was given to the vast northern and western portions of the Northwest
                    Territory. No state carries a more appropriate name than does Indiana. It is a name comparable to
                        <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi> and likewise to <hi rend="i">Westsylvania</hi> and <hi rend="i">Transylvania</hi>, the last
                    two being historic appellations that would fitly designate West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, respectively. It was but a brief span of years until Indiana Territory, whittled down
                    to much smaller dimensions, became a state. The frontier community then admitted to the Union on an
                    equality with the eighteen states already in, has experienced many changes in the century and a
                    quarter since 1816.</p>
            <p>Reaching from <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana lies athwart the many lines of traffic, travel, and communication that cross
                    the country between the chain of great inland seas and the greatest eastern tributary of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Irvin S. Cobb, in that one of his <hi rend="i">Guyed Books</hi> which he devoted to
                    Indiana, described the Hoosier State as the "in-betweener of three great states [<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> were the other two] which go sprawling across the same parallels having the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> as their common border on the South and stretching northward,
                    all three of them, to the Great Lakes." The meaning of the strategic location of Indiana is
                    that the state cannot escape being influenced profoundly by the ceaseless flow of ideas and goods
                    across its confines from East to West and West to East. The similar North-South lines have never
                    occupied the highly important position <pb n="112" id="VAA4025-039-2-004"/> of the East-West lines,
                    one result of which has been that sectional cleavages have been far more marked between northern and
                    southern than between eastern and western portions of the commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Indiana has no mountain area, but the Allegheny Plateau extends across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, furnishing southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and much of southern Indiana with rough areas. This carved-up, low plateau country is
                    quite wide on the eastern side of Indiana, its northern edge running southwestward and reaching the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> above <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. To say this another way, the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> does not run along the
                    outer, lower edge of the Allegheny Plateau but holds a position on that plateau from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to a point between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a few miles above the mouth of the Big Miami, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> bluffs are quite formidable, as they are at all points to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and beyond, though conspicuously absent at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and below. The hills of southeastern Indiana and those which extend from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> counties southward to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> add variety, color, and romance to the state. The scenes that present themselves to the
                    observer from the top of a ridge in the "Hoosier Alps" are not essentially
                    different in appearance from hundreds that may be found in the plateau areas of the Appalachians or
                    the Ozarks.</p>
            <p>The great central region of Indiana is more gently rolling, being rugged only in the vicinity of
                    river bluffs. This irregular middle country is drained by the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and its tributaries, the greatest of which is the <geogName>White River</geogName>,
                    formed by the union of two branches, East Fork and West Fork, on the northern edge of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike County</region>
                    </placeName>. The greater part of the state south of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> is drained into the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> by the <geogName>White River</geogName>, through its two branches and their
                    tributaries. The Indiana streams that reach the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> directly between the mouths of the Big Miami and the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> are relatively short, and few Hoosiers living in areas other than the belt along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> know the names of any of them.</p>
            <p>The northern part of Indiana is flatter, river bluffs are low or wanting, and the continental divide
                    which can be traced across it is observed only by those who take the trouble to look for it with
                    care. The principal river of northeastern Indiana is the Maumee, which is formed by the junction of
                    the St. Mary with the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>. Ft. Wayne is located at the point of union. Usually, when two rivers join <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-039-2-005"/> to form another, the resulting stream takes the direction of one or the
                    other or follows an intermediate line. The Maumee is a pronounced non-conformist, since it takes off
                    in an opporsite direction from that naturally expected, almost bisecting the acute angle formed by
                    the two streams that join to create it, as it flows northeastward towards Lake <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The central portion of northern Indiana is drained by the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, which flows southward to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which joins the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> of the Lake at a point within the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Kankakee once drained or tried to drain the flat marshy district of northwestern
                    Indiana, its waters reaching the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> by way of the <geogName>Illinois River</geogName> system. The expression,
                    "tried to drain," is employed advisedly, since it required an immense amount of
                    dredging before the sluggish Kankakee and its equally sluggish tributaries were able to function
                    successfully. Even after success was attained by the persistent aid of man and at considerable
                    expense, the results were not entirely satisfactory; considerable portions of the once world-famous
                    swamps of the Kankakee, that attracted sportsmen from far and wide, including some from
                    across' the Atlantic, have been restored.</p>
            <p>Northern Indiana and most of the central part of the state lie in the glaciated area, a fact which
                    has exerted a marked influence on the economic life and development of that region. Much but not all
                    of the state was originally heavily forested. Lakes abound in various parts of Indiana's
                    glaciated country, and in recent years a number of remarkable artificial lakes have been created in
                    hill regions.</p>
            <p>Extensive coal deposits occupy a long triangular district of the southwestern part of the
                    commonwealth, the base of the triangle resting on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> with the apex near the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> boundary, not far north of the southward turn in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. Soils of great variety are found over the more than 36,000 square miles that lie
                    within the boundaries of Indiana. There is a considerable variation in the winters and summers of
                    northern, middle, and southern Indiana. All parts of the state are, however, subject to visitations
                    of cold waves, heat waves, droughts, and short periods or even seasons marked by too much rainfall.
                    It can be asserted, nevertheless, with no fear of successful contradiction, that Indiana comprises
                    an area highly favored by nature in fertile soil, fuels, climate, location, and scenery. If a
                    wonderful civilization has not <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-039-2-006"/> been built or cannot be built,
                    in Hoosierland, certainly the reasons must be found in the people or in the influencing factors that
                    lie outside its boundaries. It must be admitted at once, as a matter of course, that the development
                    of Indiana has been profoundly affected by natural conditions, by the capacity of her citizens, and
                    by outside influences, among which should be stressed the significant events and changes that have
                    occurred in the remainder of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and in the world at large.</p>
            <p>Indiana may not have started on a shoestring but she surely started from scratch. In 1800 there was
                    nothing but virgin land, forests and prairie, with untouched resources and a meagre Indian
                    population. In 1816, when statehood was conferred, the territorial census takers could count less
                    than 64,000 men, women, and children, excluding Indians. Statehood being greatly desired, it is safe
                    to say that the reported number was not too small. At the moment of admission to the Union with all
                    of the privileges of existing states, the people of Indiana occupied a belt about thirty-five miles
                    wide along the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, plus a narrow strip along the western line of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> southward from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a few settlements along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> northward to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Politically Indiana ceased to be a colony of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1816, but economically and socially it remained a colony of the older states for
                    several decades. The pioneer stage came later in each successive area as the edge of settlement
                    advanced northward and northwestward; but in some of the newer sections pioneering was completed
                    more rapidly. The dates for first settlements are not safe guides in regard to the length of the
                    pioneer stage in different parts of the state. In a number of counties in southern and central
                    Indiana, frontier life remained long after its characteristics had disappeared from counties formed
                    later and located farther northward. Indeed, pioneer ways, homes, and roads may still be observed in
                    out-of-the-way Hoosier neighborhoods.</p>
            <p>As was true in older belts to the eastward and southeastward, colonized before Indiana, and of the

            <p>In general, the colonization of Indiana was pretty well completed by 1860. Most of the lands of the
                    state were reduced to private ownership within the preceding half century. The counties of the state
                    were formed in that period. Lands were cleared and towns and villages grew up. Local and state
                    governments were developed, following closely the patterns furnished by older states. Churches
                    dotted the land and a few colleges were established. Facilities for general education came very
                    slowly. The system of common schools supported by public taxation, in which there has been such a
                    great and justifiable pride, did not come into existence until after the Civil War; but a veritable
                    miracle was performed by Hoosiers in the few years intervening between 1873 and 1890. In this
                    remarkably brief period, the free public school system of Indiana was created, including many of the
                    high schools. It is doubtful whether any civilized community has ever done anything of such high
                    value so quickly and so well.</p>

            <p>The boom years following in the wake of Lee's surrender, that were marked by crooked
                    business and accompanied by crooked politics, were succeeded by a panic and hard times. The
                    depression was over in a few years, but it brought disillusionment to many people. The Middle West
                    had been a region of plenty with advancing population, developing institutions, growing towns,
                    better transportation, and increasing wealth. Leaders who looked below the surface had reason to be
                    discouraged. The fortunes that were accumulated during the war and the ensuing prosperous years were
                    beyond anything known prior to 1860, while the power of wealth resting in the hands of limited
                    numbers, with the masses facing unexpected problems and living none too well, disturbed all who took
                    time out to think on the situation. It was only natural that questions should often occur to
                    dissatisfied farmers, struggling small-business men, and the increasing number of laborers with no
                    property who depended solely on the wages of the day at hand. The question was hard to frame, but in

                    Republic resting on the unlimited resources of the country was in practice falling far short of its
                    promises.</p>
            <p>The truth was that Indiana, like the rest of the country, was in the early stage of a long transition
                    period produced by the coming of the industrial revolution. The pioneer period with its seeming
                    guarantee of not only political democracy but a large degree of economic equality, at least equality
                    of opportunity for all, had not ended until the new regime of the industrial revolution swept in and
                    over one community after another. The South struggling through the long troubled years of political
                    reconstruction and economic rehabilitation, did not face the problems of the new industrial regime
                    so early, but to Indiana, as to the rest of the North and West, the age of transition came too
                    promptly. Stating the case somewhat figuratively, the industrial revolution slipped up on the blind
                    side of America, in the guise of an unmixed blessing, and was welcomed and accepted before it was
                    understood. In a country guided by the principle of <hi rend="i">laissez faire</hi> in regard to
                    about everything except the protective tariff, perhaps nothing else could have been expected. The
                    development of the new industrial regime was permitted to go on with but feeble attempts to direct
                    or regulate it for a number of years. Those who cried out against it were but voices in the
                    wilderness. Conservatives all over the nation, those of Indiana marching in the front ranks, adopted
                    an easy way to avoid responsibility. They simply held that the only danger to prosperity and
                    happiness consisted in doctrines of political demagogues and other agitators who persisted in
                    proclaiming that there were great wrongs to be righted. Repudiate the "calamity
                    howlers" and all would be well. This benighted idea still prevails widely as a substitute
                    for grappling with actual conditions. Any one who cares to take time can count plenty of
                    conservative leaders of ability, not confined to one party, on both sides of 1900, who conformed to
                    this pattern. This mark of the conservative leadership of Indiana would not be noticed here but for
                    the conviction that so few intelligent citizens of the state feel any concern in regard to it.
                    Indeed, any Hoosier liberal is justified in the fear that his beloved state will continue to accept
                    and follow conservative leadership while crucifying progressives.</p>
            <p>It must be admitted that Indiana conservatives are pronounced worshipers at the shrines of liberals,
                    who have acted fearlessly in past crises and emergencies, but the sad part <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-039-2-011"/> of it all is that these ardent friends of outstanding advocates of
                    change who have been dead for some time fail to catch the spirit of their departed heroes and, God
                    help them, do not know that they so fail. The most baffling thing confronting liberals in Indiana is
                    the difficulty of reaching the minds of the mass of intelligent citizens. Surely he is a friend of
                    the state who hopes and prays that such a condition may not continue to prevail, since indifference
                    is an efficient promoter of deterioration. In other words, there are two kinds of decay with which
                    those who observe carefully are familiar. Anyone can recognize the condition of a rotten cabbage or
                    tree, but there is also a dry-rot, no less sure in its results, that is not easily seen. Citizens of
                    Indiana have often refused to look for the evidence of this species of decay, or to heed the
                    menacing message when pointed out. No one can demonstrate that Indiana has not had a history of
                    which her citizens may feel proud, but it seems equally clear that the reactions of her people to
                    the grave problems of the last seventy-five years, which have been so largely economic, have often
                    not been based on deep insight or clear vision.</p>
            <p>The structure of civilization which has been erected in Indiana during her brief history is not
                    essentially different from that in other states of the Union. If anything, Hoosiers have been too
                    prone to conform to the general pattern, rather than to draft new blue-prints and try them out. It
                    has been hard to realize that wisdom cannot always lie with elements who regard experimentation with
                    horror; yet there can be no progress without the courage to venture on new paths. It is never safe
                    for any people to decide that the existing order is entirely sacred and that it must be maintained
                    intact. The foolishness of such an idea is manifest when one thinks of how many seemingly solid
                    historic institutions have disappeared as the centuries have passed. When it is brought to mind that
                    the present industrial set-up, with its colossal capital, armies of laborers, and accompanying
                    financial structure of gigantic proportions, is as yet very young, it should be readily understood
                    that defects are natural. It seems axiomatic that the only sound principle is to admit the defects
                    and remove them as promptly and painlessly as possible.</p>
            <p>It is not the contention that Indiana can do much by herself to remake the country or the world. It
                    is believed to be a sound and sane argument, nevertheless, that the people of Indiana should be
                    anxious and ready to help in rehabilitating and making over the world at the close of the present
                        <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-039-2-012"/> conflict. Also it is believed to be the part of wisdom to
                    recommend that, in the future, Indiana should be less prone to pull back and more anxious to support
                    the efforts and plans of leaders who wish to make America a better place in which to
                    live—a country where the welfare and the rights of the humblest citizen will be made as
                    secure as possible; where economic as well as political democracy shall prevail. Is it too much to
                    hope that the Hoosier commonwealth may become an outstanding and daring experimenter among the
                    states of the nation in the new day that is coming, not a blind champion of a return to
                    normalcy—a return that is impossible in any event.</p>
            <p>The abundance and excellence of Indiana's resources have already been stressed. The high
                    average of well-being is something that would naturally be expected. It is something of which the
                    state has a right to, be proud. The absence of extremes is noteworthy in regard to climate, economic
                    conditions, politics, and racial elements. This does not mean that the cities of Indiana do not have
                    their poor districts, but it does mean that poverty is not so intensive nor the areas where it
                    prevails so extensive as in some sister states. The absence of striking contrasts tends to enhance
                    the conservatism of Hoosiers, though it does not necessarily make them into reactionaries of the
                    Bourbon type. Progressive leaders can win victories in Indiana, but they cannot, as a rule, hold out
                    very long against the powerful currents that are directed against them. In this contention, it is a
                    sad commentary on the rank and file of the citizens of Indiana that they can so complacently permit
                    conservative interests to drive liberals from positions of leadership.</p>
            <p>The resources of Indiana are still very great. The state is not dominated by a large city. There is
                    still a fairly even balance between agriculture and industry and likewise between Republicans and
                    Democrats. Hoosiers are today about as fit physically and mentally as any. There is a mellowness
                    about life in Hoosierland that inspires literary talent to express itself. A considerable part of
                    the population can find time for reflection. These are conditions that should bring results, and it
                    is possible to indulge the hope that they may become the foundation for greater social and economic
                    progress, for a higher culture and a nobler vision, and for leadership of a higher arid more daring
                    quality.</p>

                    she did not choose to divide the dominion over the soil of the river bed. With the exception of
                    Indiana, however, the states involved have failed or refused to understand the twofold aspect of the
                    problem.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> statutes, one of 1824 and another of 1828, was questioned. The former. made liable to
                    damages the master of any vessel who suffered a slave to come aboard for the purpese of crossing the
                    river. The latter statute extended the liabilities to the "owners, mate, clerk, pilot, and
                    engineer." In the case in question, suit for damages was brought against some of the owners
                    and officers of the steamboat "Magnolia," because three slaves had been taken
                    aboard and carried without the owner's consent from <placeName>

            <p>The plea of the defense attorney in this case was that "the slaves were not taken from <placeName>

                    her constitution of 1851 the following clause: "The State of Indiana…shall have
                    concurrent jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, with the State of <placeName>

            <p>And so rests the problem of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. But, as we have seen, only Indiana
                    has accepted a rational and legal point of view concerning it—that the boundary of the
                    states formed of the Old Northwest extends only to low-water mark on the northern shore, but that
                    these states have concurrent jurisdiction on the entire river, where it touches their shores, with

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    </placeName> accepts the low-water mark as a boundary line but she limits her jurisdiction to the

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> collection. Like thousands of others, he became deeply interested in the story of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s life as the Civil War President's secretaries, Nicolay and Hay,
                    related it month by month in the <hi rend="i">Century Magazine</hi> fifty odd years ago. Mr. Oakleaf
                    was then a young lawyer in Moline, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and, one may safely assume, not overburdened with money. Nevertheless, he resolved to
                    make a collection of biographies of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Some years later he was influenced by a copy of Daniel Fish's <hi rend="i">Bibliography</hi>, and by the encouragement of Fish himself, to enlarge his fields from
                    biographies alone to all <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> literature. His resolution was strengthened soon afterward when he got in touch with
                    Fish's friendly rivals in the collecting of Lincolniana—Stewart, Lambert,
                    McLellan, and Burton.</p>
            <p>I take it that Oakleaf was unaware, in 1890, that he was following a tradition already well
                    established. Not until years afterwards did he learn that the collecting of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> books and pamphlets had begun even before <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s death; that as early as 1865 William V. Spencer had published a list
                    containing 231 titles of his own ownership. Five years afterward Andrew Boyd listed the titles of
                    500 books, pamphlets, broadsides, and emphemeral publications in his collection, while Charles Henry
                    Hart itemized nearly that number of sermons and eulogies which he had assembled. By this
                    time—1870—William H. Lambert of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> was actively collecting; so was Charles W. McLellan of Champlain, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>; and John E. Burton, of Lake <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Geneva</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, was soon to begin. The other members of the Big Five, or Big Six, as they finally came
                    to be known—Judd Stewart and Daniel Fish—were also predecessors of Oakleaf in
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> field.</p>
            <p>It is probable too, that Judge Oakleaf was unaware, at least in the beginning, that he was following
                    a tradition antedating by centuries the collecting of Lincolniana. Almost from the beginning of
                    printing men have acquired books, and the genus collector—the bibliomaniac, as some would
                    have it—was a well established character in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and Europe as early as the middle of the seventeenth century. But not <pb n="134" id="VAA4025-039-2-026"/> there only. We, as Americans, can take pride in the fact that men of
                    the breed made their appearance on our own shores almost at the beginning of colonial times. As far
                    as 1 know, there were no book collectors among the one hundred men and boys who disembarked at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jamestown</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1607, but the <hi rend="i">Mayflower</hi> carried not only the first families of the
                    New World, not only much of the furniture that stocks New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s antique shops, but also our first bibliophile. He was William
                    Brewster—Elder Brewster of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> church—who bought books throughout his life, and died possessed of almost
                    400 volumes. Nor was he alone. Of similar tastes, but with less chance to indulge them, was none
                    other than the bluff but timorous Miles Standish, whose estate included fifty books.</p>
            <p>These, of course, were only precursors, soon to be eclipsed by those who followed in their footsteps.
                    Foremost among the latter were the Mathers. Richard Mather began to collect books in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> as early as 1610; in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Bay Colony he kept up the practice. His son and grandson, Increase and Cotton Mathers,
                    added to the collection until in the latter's time it numbered 4000 volumes and "a
                    prodigious number of manuscripts." Second only to the Mathers in book collecting was Samuel
                    Sewall, better known as a diarist and as a member of the court which tried the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> witches. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, William Byrd of Westover—planter, author, and colonial
                    official—was gathering what was, for its time, the greatest library in the South. Among
                    his 3600 volumes were to be found the works of all important English writers from Chaucer to his own
                    day as well as the writings of such continental Europeans as Boccaccio and Rabelais. (One suspects
                    that his was a far more interesting collection than those of his strait-laced contemporaries in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>.) Byrd, moreover, set a precedent: several times in his life he had to sell land and
                    negroes to pacify his creditors. (It is not recorded that he ever parted with any of his books.)</p>
            <p>To call the roll of American book collectors would be pleasant and perhaps instructive, but it would
                    certainly require more time than even a greedy speaker should take on an occasion like this. Suffice
                    to say that the roll includes many a famous name—Benjamin Franklin at the end of the 18th
                    century; John Adams and Thomas Jefferson in the early years of the Republic; John Carter <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, James Lenox, <pb n="135" id="VAA4025-039-2-027"/> J. Pierpont Morgan, and Henry E.
                    Huntington in the 19th and 20th centuries. Those names are hardly a beginning, but they are
                    sufficient in number to establish both the character and continuity of the fraternity of collectors
                    with which Judge Oakleaf allied himself when he bought his first biography of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> half a century ago.</p>
            <p>In still another sense, it was a great tradition which he was following. Note, if you will, a few
                    bare facts. The Bodleian Library, one of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s great university libraries, was founded—or, more properly,
                    refounded—by Sir Thomas Bodley's gift of books and manuscripts. The beloved
                    books of Samuel Pepys, diarist without a peer, went to Magdalen College at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Sir Hans Sloane's gift of 50,000 books led to the establishment of the
                    British Museum in 1753, and the institution was greatly enriched later by the royal libraries
                    donated by George II, and to his eternal credit, George III. (The latter's gift was 80,000
                    books and pamphlets, and 440 manuscripts.) In America <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> University took its name from the young clergyman who bequeathed to it his library of
                    three or four hundred books. It was the private library of Thomas Jefferson, purchased by the
                    nation, which became the nucleus of the Library of Congress after that infant institution was
                    destroyed in the War of 1812. Before Jefferson, and after him, the acquisitions of collectors have
                    gone to institutions, either by gift or purchase, with such frequency that a leading authority,
                    William Dana Orcutt, has offered this considered judgment: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"It is mainly by the zeal of private collectors that books which otherwise would
                            have perished from neglect are discovered, preserved and made to yield up their secrets,
                            with the result that almost every great library owes more, on its historical side, to their
                            generosity than to the purchases made from its own resources."</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Whether this be true in general or not, it is certainly true of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> collections. Take the collections of those men whom I described as the friendly rivals

                    auction, but it is safe to assume that nearly all of them are now parts of public collections or
                    destined for that end. For <pb n="136" id="VAA4025-039-2-028"/> the process continues. In the last
                    few years the very fine collection of Henry Horner has gone to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> State Historical Library, that of David Nelson to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> Memorial University, that of Valentine Bjorkman to Upsala College, that of A. H.
                    Greenly to the William L. Clements Library, and that of Ida M. Tarbell to her alma mater, Allegheny
                    College. To my personal knowledge, moreover, several outstanding present-day collectors have made
                    arrangements to bequeath their collections to institutions of learning, and I have no doubt that
                    there are others who will come to the same decision, if they have not done so already.</p>
            <p>This bare recital emphasizes two points. One is that in Indiana University, a great institution of
                    learning, the Oak-leaf collection has found as appropriate a home as anyone could wish. The second
                    is the fact that so much of the collector's work is done for the ultimate benefit of
                    scholars that scholars owe men like J. B. Oakleaf a very heavy debt. That point is worth repeating
                    time and again, because I am far from sure that the scholar is aware of the obligation.</p>
            <p>Of course I am using words loosely. Admittedly, the collector can be, and often is, a scholar; and by
                    the same token the scholar can be, and sometimes is, a collector. But by and large, the two words
                    designate distinct, easily recognizable classes, the scholar being one who is interested solely in
                    the contents of a book or manuscript, while the collector is that strange person to whom the book or
                    manuscript has value apart from, or in addition to, what is in it.</p>
            <p>Now the scholar is just a little bit inclined to look down his nose at the collector. It is hard for
                    him to understand, for example, why the collector builds a fence around his field.
                    "What!" he says to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> collector, "you don't include the Welles Diary or the Diary of
                    Orville H. Browning in your <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> collection? But man, they're basic sources!" "To be
                    sure," replies the collector with just a touch of warmth because he has been all through
                    this times without end; "but those books aren't devoted <hi rend="i">in major
                    part</hi> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and that's the line I draw." "But you would put in a
                    worthless little pamphlet like that Vose campaign biography of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and pay a stiff price for it too." "You bet I would,"
                    replies the collector with a gleam in his eye; "do you know where I can find one?"
                    The scholar gives up—there's no use talking to a fanatic.</p>
            <pb n="137" id="VAA4025-039-2-029"/>
            <p>Of course, the example 1 have cited—and it is not an imaginary one—cannot be
                    justified on any logical ground. Some limitation, however, is a practical necessity, and the
                    boundary might just as well be sharp and straight as blurred and wavy. Besides, the point of
                    difference is of little real significance. Copies of the Welles Diary, the Diary of Orville H.
                    Browning, and the other standard works which the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> collector rules out are legion, but try to find the Vose biography! (Just two copies
                    are known to be in existence.) And who can be sure that any book or pamphlet on a live subject is
                    worthless? I used to think that the sermons preached on the occasion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s death were as nearly valueless as printed paper could be. So they are, from
                    the standpoint of the biographer interested in the facts of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s life. Search them all and I don't suppose you will find a single
                    biographical fact that can't be found, in better authenticated form, in some far more
                    accessible source. But fourteen or fifteen years ago Lloyd Lewis wrote one of the most original
                    books in all <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> literature, <hi rend="i">Myths After <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>. And in that book three of the most interesting chapters are based on what?
                    The sermons preached on the occasion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s death!</p>
            <p>The scholar is often unable to understand, moreover, the collector's insistence upon
                    originals. "A photostat will do just as well," is one of his favorite remarks. And
                    when the collector carries his quest to the point of insisting not only upon the original, but upon
                    original condition as well, the scholar sometimes looks upon him with pity. "The poor
                    simpleton," he says to himself, "what does it matter if the front cover is gone?
                    The text is all there."</p>
            <p>To that argument the collector can make an effective reply. In the first place, it is obvious that if
                    one is to have photostats, there must first be originals, and it is also obvious that if everyone
                    were content with photostats, before long most of the originals would be sold for waste paper. In
                    the second place, there are times when a photostat won't do just as well. For example, the
                    question of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of Nancy Hanks <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> hinges upon the interpretation of a famous document—specifically, upon
                    whether the letters wi, making the word "widoy" or, conceivably, widow, are to be
                    found in a given place. The finest reproduction is inconclusive, but examination of the document
                    itself reveals clearly that those letters do not, in fact, exist. In the <pb n="138" id="VAA4025-039-2-030"/> third place, the original book, pamphlet, or letter makes an
                    appeal—a contribution, if you will—all its own. That contribution is best
                    expressed in the words of one of the most distinguished teachers of our time—the late
                    George Herbert Palmer of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>—who was both a scholar and collector.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>It is easy to over-estimate the value of old books…, their shape is often unhandy,

                        supplied with such notes and introductions as enable a reader to stand where the printer

                    Perhaps—but I should like to point out that universities find room willingly enough for
                    quite a few subjects whose appeal is largely emotional—for lyric poetry, for music, for
                    the fine arts. You don't care for John Donne, or Shostakovich, or—shall be we

            <p>Not only that: respect his own rules of the game when his handiwork comes into your possession. He
                    put more than his money, more than his time and knowledge, into his collection. Don't glue
                    labels on his rare books, don't plaster them with ownership stamps or pockets,
                    don't perforate the pages, don't rebind them unless you have to, and
                    don't paste his paper-covered pamphlets into ordinary pamphlet binders. In a word, keep his
                    collection in its original condition. Something of his life is in his books. Don't destroy
                    it.</p>
            <p>I have said that it was most appropriate that the Oakleaf Collection should find its final home in
                    the Indiana University. I had in mind, as I pointed out, the established affinity between
                    collections of books and institutions of learning. But in this case there is a further reason for
                    the fittingness of this conjunction. Only with my own state was Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> more intimately associated than with Indiana: where more properly should a great <placeName>

                    </placeName> collection be located than in Indiana's state university? And what more
                    fitting than that that collection should have been the life work of a citizen of <placeName>

            <p>Readers of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> will be interested to know that on February 13, Indiana
                    University formally opened to the public the Indiana Oakleaf collection of Lincolniana. This
                    collection is now housed in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> Room located in the rare book area of the main library building where it may be viewed
                    and used by both the public and the student.</p>
            <p>It will be remembered that the University acquired the Oakleaf Collection by purchase in December of
                    1941. This was made possible by contributions to the Indiana University Foundation by the Ball
                    Brothers Foundation of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, spent over forty years gathering the material. By the time of his death in 1930, his
                    collection numbered some 8000 items. An entire issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> could be
                    taken up with a description of the Oakleaf Collection alone. Suffice to say that in printed and
                    pictorial material it embraces practically every aspect of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> theme. Speeches, biographies, histories, memoirs, journals, and diaries as well as
                    contemporary photographs, steel engravings, and lithographs enable one to get an estimate of the man <placeName>

            <p>Since the Oakleaf Collection came to the University, much new material has been added to the
                    collection through the generosity of friends. The Ball Brothers Foundation recently presented a rare
                    and striking oil portrait of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1860. More recently this Foundation purchased the Robert Coster collection of
                    Lincolniana which contains over fifty manuscripts by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>

            <p>A dinner held on the evening of February 13, marked the opening of the Collection. Due to war-time
                    restrictions on travel, the dinner was limited to fifty invited guests. Present were <placeName>

                    Harry Pratt, James Monaghan, William H. Townsend, R. Gerald McMurtry and others. The governmental
                    officials of Indiana were represented by Governor Schricker, Lieuten-ant-Governor Dawson, and others
                    from both the House and Senate. The University was represented by administrative officials and
                    members of the history department. Rounding out the list of guests were George A. Ball and A. M.
                    Bracken representing the Ball Brothers Foundation, William G. Irwin, and Frank L. Jones.</p>
            <p>The program on that occasion proved to be very appropriate and interesting. J. L. Oakleaf, son of
                    Joseph B. Oakleaf, spoke on the collecting activities of his father. Paul M. Angle, editor of the

            <p>The library of the Indiana Historical Society has added to its collection during the past half year a

            <p>Four letters of August and September, 1812, tell of affairs at Fort Harrison, then at rather a crisis

            <p>To the library's already extensive collection of William Henry Harrison papers have been

            <head>A HOOSIER INVADES THE CONFEDERACY</head>

            <byline>Edited by John D. Barnhart</byline>
            <p>The life of an Indiana soldier in the Civil War is intimately pictured in the diary and letters of
                    Leroy S. Mayfield. Marching and sleeping in the rain, pulling the wagon trains up Lookout Mountain,
                    witnessing the execution of deserters, foraging for food, encouraging a brother to get an education
                    before enlisting, protesting the high prices charged by army sutlers—"the army
                    pest" as he termed them, lying in the hospitals when wounded, and busying the body of a
                    loved and respected officer are a few of the intimate details which he describes.</p>
            <p>The contribution of Indiana to the national armies in the western theatre of the War Between the
                    States is also reflected in these writings. Mayfield was one of many representatives of the loyal
                    citizenry of southern Indiana. No word of complaint against his higher officers, no grumbling about
                    long, hard marches or short rations, and no flinching in his loyal devotion to the Union was
                    recorded, not even when he lay wounded on the field of battle for thirty-six hours. He was in the
                    army for a purpose and he intended to stay until that purpose was accomplished, if his life were
                    spared. His cousin, Copernicus H. Coffey, and his brother Joseph, were killed and he was severely
                    wounded—events which testify to the loyalty of his family.</p>
            <p>Conditions described covered such a wide field as to be fairly representative of the western area.

            <p>The writings of Mayfield consist of thirty-four letters to his brother Joseph and two diaries,
                    written while in the field or shortly before he enlisted. There is no evidence that he anticipated
                    that any part of them would be published. They were written hurriedly and sometimes under conditions
                    that made writing difficult. The usual defects of such material are present, such as incorrect
                    spelling, very peculiar punctuation, and grammatical errors. It is impossible to be certain about
                    capitalization and often to tell where a new sentence begins. The writings have been reproduced as
                    faithfully as possible and without change. For reasons of space many remarks about the weather and
                    advice to his younger brother about his education and about writing were omitted. The original
                    letters and diaries are in the possession of Miss Ura Sanders, of Gosport, Indiana. Typewritten

                        <p>I arrived here yesterday after-noon amidst the most deafening cheers that I ever
                                    heard on any occasion. the boys came runing, between 500 and 800 in number, to meet
                                    their friends, to see who had come. We had a toilsome journey, in consequence of
                                    mis-connection, caused by change of time, on the roads. We arrived at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                                    </placeName> about 5 o'clock in the afternoon and had to remain until one
                                    at night. We then started for North <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, arriving there at 3 o'clock in the morning, where we lay down
                                    on the floor of the Depot, and remained until day. I slept almost none during our
                                    passage.</p>
                        <p>We have as nice, if not the nicest camp, in the state. our sleeping rooms are good,
                                    and very good, compared with those of many other camps….</p>
                        <p>Our camp is in sight of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                                    </placeName>, but we can not [see] the <geogName>Ohio-River</geogName>, becaus it is
                                    behind the hills, and timber</p>
                        <p>I went down to the River this afternoon, and took a swim. you may rest assured that
                                    it is a nice business. After we get fairly organized, we will be kept pretty close.
                                    I have not been out on guard as Yet</p>
                        <p>18th This morning I was placed on guard, and also C. H. Coffey, and we had, by no
                                    means, an easy time, having to wait until near 2 o'clock for dinner. Our
                                    Company has gone to the river to day. James, Whisenand, and James, Fenley, came down
                                    with us on monday. The boys, generaly appear to be well satisfied, though one of our
                                    company, "took a fence furlow," that is, he broke guard, crossed
                                    the fence, and has gone home….I think that our officers will be good to
                                    us. We have music plenty, and to spare.</p>
                        <p>Oh! yes, while I think of it, I saw a Woman a few moments since. There is no [use] to
                                    try to tell you what all is going on in camp continualy. it would take more than a
                                    dozen sheets of paper to contain it.</p>
                        <p>My mess mates are, J. T. Eller, J. W. Eller, Wm. Robertson, Henry Huston, and a young
                                    Douglas. I am as well satisfied as you ever saw me.</p>
                        <p>my rest is out I must go to guard….</p>

                        <p>Be sure and bring your shawl, two Coats (,Summer) two Shirts, and as much as two
                                    pairs of socks, and also some for me. And as many other little things as sou wish to
                                    bring with you. I wish you to bring a hickory shirt for me, if I have a new one at

                        <p>It is an awful hard place….We have plenty to eat, but it is not always of

                        <p>We are again lying in camp, or rather in tents, waiting for guns, with which to

                                    to drill several hours every day and sunday to. The Col is so wicked, and hard

                                    from where we landed. we marched out here last Saturday, and bearly had [time] to
                                    "pitch" tents before night, and then prepare supper after night,
                                    of what vegetables we had bought during the day. We drew no bread, therefore had

                        <p>Yours of the 20th was received day before yesterday, just as we were preparing to go
                                    out on "picket" guard. we did not return until last night,
                                    consequently, had no chance to write. We, (5 of our mess) were out about 5 miles
                                    from camp. we had a very pleasant time except that it rained to hard while we were
                                    out. we got plenty of fruit to eat, and to bring into camp with us. I carried two
                                    "haversacks" full of provisions, one full of
                                    "fresh" pork, and the other full of apples. W[h]en I got into
                                    camp, and cooled, I could not use my right arm, so you may know that we have very
                                    plenty eat now for a few days if the secessionists do not break in upon us and take
                                    what we have. we also met with a chance to exchange coffee (which we had saved of
                                    our rations) for corn-meal, (which makes cakes, when fried, equal to sweet cakes at

                                    afloat, in regard to the position of the rebels, but no one, is known to be true. It
                                    is now reported that they are on two sides of us. we do not believe it.</p>

                                    hundred secessionists in this part of the country, but they fled as has been their
                                    custom. This is a beatiful country and the citizens appear very friendly. Some are
                                    so through fear, others are truly so at heart. I have been out in the country, and
                                    became somewhat acquainted with a few of the citizens, one of whom is a Minister of
                                    the Gospel, a Missionary Baptist. I have just returned to camp, from a visit to his
                                    house. if we remain here until sabbath I shall go to hear him preach. The weather is
                                    very warm, although we have a nice shaded camp, in a thickly timbered grove. the
                                    wood, ticks….are so annoying, that we can scarcely rest, at
                                    all….There is, or was plenty of provisions in the country before we came
                                    here. the boys have plenty of money and are not afraid to use it.</p>
                        <p>Our pay-roll has been made out. we will not likely receive pay for a month or more. A
                                    dispatch has come, announcing the federal possession of New-Orleans, by Gen Butlers
                                    forces. we do not know whether true or not. Steam-bcats run up white-river above
                                    this point, but they do not risk the enterprise now. When the <placeName>

                                    very good in the army at present, considering the nice time we have had wading
                                    rivers and smaller, streams. On last Saturday we marched 25 miles, through rain and
                                    mud, without grub.</p>
                        <p>….I hope the time is not far distant, when the rebellion will be crushed
                                    out….</p>

                                    our tents, which we have practiced so much lately, as to become very familiar with
                                    it. The weather is very warm. the sand heats in the roads, so as to make it very
                                    disagreeable marching in it.</p>
                        <p>There were about 200 rebel cavalry, (Cotton burners) here at this town night before
                                    last but they have gone far beyond our reach. They are traveling the country over,
                                    and burning all the cotton they can find, to prevent its falling into our hands as
                                    they pretend to think that we are out stealing cotton, but I hope they will soon
                                    find our mission quite a differ[ent] one. The citizens in this part of the country

                        <p>As official reports will not give the minute details of the performances of the 22nd
                                    for the last 2 or 3 weeks, I will write to you. On the 1st of Oct Father and I
                                    parted on the streets of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and we marched out in pursuit of the enemy. To me, it was a matter of
                                    no little weight, to separate at that time As a matter of course, I was a little
                                    "home-sick" for a time hut not dangerously so. I had some very
                                    hard labor to perform, for more than a week during the absence of the boys. I bore
                                    it all with pleasure, hoping that they were enjoying themselves finely. three of the
                                    boys have not yet returned. A. C. Ranard is absent yet. After marching two days from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, skirmishing with the enemies pickets and rear guard, was kept up every
                                    day. they gradualy gave back until they arrived near Perryville where they halted to
                                    give battle.</p>
                        <p>We were not called into action until Wednesday afternoon. marched onto the battle
                                    ground under a heavy fire, formed, which was, but the work of a moment, and began
                                    the deadly work. we were not engaged more than 21/2 hours, the average of shot I
                                    think was not far, from 15 rounds. our position on the field was changed three or
                                    four times, this of course hindered us from shooting so much as we would, had we
                                    been stationed that length of time. The boys, almost without exception, behaved
                                    nobly. it appeared that all fear had gone, and every one determined to sell his life
                                    dearly as possible. J. H. Pettus fell, as "Soldier," a
                                    "brave" boy" he received two shots. While the battle was
                                    raging with fury, and the balls singing about over head like a swarm of bees, his
                                    gun was struck by a ball, which glanced and "grazed" the side of
                                    his head. He raised his gun, and coolly remarked to his comrade, "If I live
                                    to get home, I shall take this gun with me," then <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-039-2-042"/> raised the gun to his shoulder, took deliberate aim,
                                    and fired. this is one instance, of the many that I might mention, of coolness, that
                                    occured during the battle. Many of the boys received shots through their clothing,
                                    some: many as three or four shots. Neither C. H. nor I received a mark of any
                                    discription. The dead! how thick they lay. The wounded! how awful their groans. Oh!
                                    may I never see such a sight, nor hear such groans again, as those witnessed on that
                                    bloody: "little spot." At the same time, the enemies loss was
                                    very, very: heavy. many of the rebel dead lay on the field for days before they were
                                    buried.</p>
                        <p>Our regimental "colors" were torne to strings and the bearer shot,
                                    another gathered the staff and he to was shot, so in the darkness they were lost. I
                                    never before saw darkness come over the land sudden as it did at that time. the
                                    thickness of the smoke caused it.</p>
                        <p>Our health is good. Copernicu's visit home, did him a great deal of good.
                                    his health has been better since, than it was for months before. I do not want you
                                    to enlist again. two for three years and one for three months is enough for one
                                    family to furnish during this war. If I felt that affairs were being conducted
                                    right, I should not object to your enlisting again, but as it is I want you to
                                    remain out of bondage….</p>

                                    Co (I) were ordered out on "picket guard" immediately, we were

                                    fires. we returned to camp about noon Sabbath, but about 3 o'clock in the

                                    be unfounded, and we returned to camp by nine at night. soon after, it began to rain
                                    tremendous fast, and continued so until late at night This afternoon the 22d was
                                    ordered out to reconnoiter the hights in front, and try the strength of the enemy,
                                    if any at, all. after traveling 3 or 4 miles, returned to camp finding no enemy.
                                    There has been some cannonaiding, on our left to day, but I as yet know either the
                                    cause or the result. It is expected that we will have something to do, soon as the
                                    army begins a forward move, which, I think will not be, for a time yet. The rebels
                                    are no dout, fortifying, and preparing themselves to meet us, and give battle at

                                    southward, expecting to press forward and ingage the enemy before night. the morning
                                    was cold, but we camped 3 or 4 miles south of nashville, but no enemy was seen. we

                                    forage. The morning was beautiful, but early in the day, it clouded up, and began to
                                    rain, very fast continueing so the remainder of the day. The water in many places,
                                    was knee deep, and in othrers much deeper, if we had searched for the bottom. We

                                    without halting. I did not get very much wearied. Were out in front 9 or 10 miles
                                    South [of] town. the reb's annoyed us a little, but did not do any special

                                    a battery in to position, threw a few shells, which were heartily replied to.</p>

                                    battle. I do not like the sound of cannon very well, but I am in no way disposed to
                                    run from them, "not boasting in any way at all." Immediately after
                                    the rain ceased it turned very cold, and the ground frozed pretty hard on top, but
                                    to day it has been tolerably pleasant.</p>
                        <p>The 82d is camped east of town. I have not been over to see them since we came here.
                                    Jessee was over a few weeks since, but I have not seen any of them lately. We have
                                    something…new again, in camp. Gen Rosecrans, has ordered one Commissioned
                                    officer, two Seg'ts three corporals, and thirty privates, to be chosen by
                                    ballot, of the best and bravest men, in the Regiment, to form a company of men to be
                                    mounted, and armed with the most efficient arms that can be procured. It is supposed
                                    that they will be bold, energetic, and brave men; men of daring deeds. Four of the
                                    Pea-ridge heroes, who stood the battle through without flinching, were chosen, and
                                    two others who were absent sick at the time, but have proved themselves since, to be
                                    worthy of any position of honor. their names are as follows, Corporal, Wm. H. H.
                                    Walden, Privates, James M. Whisenand, Wm. B. Cooper, Austin Slochem, R. S. Curry,
                                    Wm. Southern. they are boys who will fight. I think that they will do good service
                                    in field after they get horses. James Whisenand is a good fellow, full of fun, as
                                    any fellow can be, and is "number one" soldier. We have not
                                    drilled a great deal, since we camped at this place. There has been so much mud. to
                                    day we went out to drill. after drilling in the "manual of arms"
                                    for a time, we stacked arms, and entered into a spirited engagement, "after

                        <p>….the dust on our drill ground had become almost intolerable. there are
                                    about five brigades and so many batteries that use this large open field to drill
                                    upon Our Regiment can drill very well, but they are a stubborn set of fellows, and
                                    when they get a little mad, they can perform worse than any new regiment that I ever
                                    saw try to perform, in any way.</p>
                        <p>…I had to go on inspection, and immediately after this was over went to
                                    the officers school, which is conducted by the Colonel, who asks questions as school
                                    teachers do in other branches of study, it is very intereting to me. I need
                                    instruction in any business that I undertake, as boys always do.</p>
                        <p>We yet have a considerable amount of duty to perform,—enough to keep us
                                    healthy. exercise proves to be a necessary requisite to health in the army. There is
                                    a limated amount of sickness in the regiment now. We have taken so much care in
                                    cleansing, grading, and planting bushy cedars in the quarters, that I thing there
                                    will not be much cause for sickness. I fear that the dead animals, which abound so
                                    plentifully in this region, will give some cause [for] sickness. Last Sabbath I was
                                    out near the "Old Battle Ground," on picket duty. It brought to
                                    mind scenes to vivid to ever be entirely forgotten.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> there

                                    the firing had continued at intervals near all night, I awoke at early dawn, almost
                                    froze, to hear the whistle of the "minie" balls and see the rebel
                                    columns advancing upon us, across an open space. Imagine our feelings for one
                                    moment—in the face of a largely superious force,—to know that
                                    in five minutes, nay! less time! that the deadly conflict must begin. there we stood
                                    firm, not knowing but that five minutes, of time might reveal an endless eternity,
                                    but soon the order came to fall back a short distance and form a new line of battle

                                    we could: knowing at the same time that they had the 1st Brigade cut off from the

                                    needed at that moment. The Brigade being cut off from the Division, reported to the
                                    Cavalry commander, with which we remained. At Crawfish Springs, there was a very

                                    while we were lying in line of battle to meet the enemy. At 4, P. M. again resumed
                                    the march northward, (leaving some of our wounded behind, but Surgeons, medicines,
                                    nurses, and Provisions, were left with them,) passed through a gap in Mission Ridge,
                                    entering the valley at root of Lookout Mountain, through which we coursed our way
                                    northward. Rebels followed close on our rear. Halted at night drew rations, and lay

                        <p>September 22, Tuesday. Awoke at 3, a.m. and marched north 2 miles. halted got
                                    breakfast by day-light, and again formed across the valley, and hastily prepared of
                                    rails and stone; some works for defense and protection. Marched from this position
                                    shortly after noon, when within two miles of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName> our flank was so hard pressed that escape appeared almost impossible.
                                    again was the Brigade formed for the purpose of self defense, while our Battery
                                    amused itself with shelling them for a time, whereupon they gave us a passway.
                                    Marched forward along the road, the rebels shelling us, to the best of their
                                    ability, which proved not to be very good as no one was hurt. Crossed Chickamauga
                                    Creek: (about one mile from <placeName>

                                    began to dig—to fortify: Co "I" was detailed on picket.
                                    The rebels kept a continuous Shelling the remainder of the day to prevent our
                                    working. Our artillery did not reply often.</p>
                        <p>September 23, Wednesday. Work progressed speedily on the works to day. All are

                                    picket at 3, P. M. About 100 shots fired from our artillery during the day without a
                                    reply. After dark a heavy fight of musketry and artillery, ensued on the left of us,
                                    in front of Branans Div. which resulted in the death of many rebels and few of our
                                    men. all under arms during the excitement, which subcided about 10, P. M.</p>
                        <p>September 24, Thursday. Under arms very early. continuous skirmishing during the day
                                    also heavy cannonading on both sides. At 4, P. M. got orders, (the 22nd Ind.

                                    began. the 22nd lost one killed and severel wound. Co "I" had one

                                    learning their force, the expedition returned at night. At 11 1/2 o'clock
                                    at night, the rebels attacked the centre,—to our left. in a moment every
                                    man was to his post in the works. The firing was heavy for one hour, ceasing at 12
                                    1/2. The firing of artillery was heavy, and beautiful to behold. All became quiet
                                    and we retired to rest for the remainder of the night.</p>
                        <p>September 25, Friday. Up at 3 A. M. and moved back to the second line of works,
                                    leaving the outer line to be occupied by the "out post" pickets,
                                    we being the reserve in the 2 line. Heavy cannonading at intervals during the day.
                                    At night the rebels attacked Johnsons pickets,—to our right—a
                                    sharp engagement of about one hours duration ensued—resulting unfavorably
                                    to the rebels, they leaving severel dead and wounded near by our works. All fly to

                                    shots: at each meal time during the day: from rebel Batteries, to make us get into

                        <p>September 27, Sabbath. The beautiful Sabbath morning dawned, and the calm peaceful
                                    air rests undisturbed, save by the sound of an occasional musket shot on the picket
                                    line: thus the day passed quietly by: A flag of "truce" was sent
                                    out to inquire after our wounded. At night, as usual, the rebels advanced in front
                                    of Johnsons Div. which was soon followed by a sharp skirmish, resulting favorably.</p>
                        <p>September 28, Monday…..A large Ambulance train passed out after wounded,
                                    between the picket lines. our Ambulance drivers were displaced: by the rebels who
                                    took them and returned to the same place the following day. Rebel Drums and Brass
                                    bands could be heard very distinctly this morning. no firing today.</p>
                        <p>September 29, Tuesday. All quiet on the lines. Brigade inspection at 8

                        <p>September 30, Wednesday. At 2 o'clock, a.m. the 22nd was ordered to the

                                    positions, Co "I", as pickets, and all quiet. At the dawn of
                                    morning, our sentinels found that they were in very close proximity to those of the
                                    rebels, some of them even so near as 60 or 80 yards, all using water from the same

                        <p>October 1, 1863, Thursday. On picket south side of Chickamauga creek, which is a deep
                                    dirty stream, with rugged steep banks. surrounding country level and beautiful, but
                                    laid waste by the ravages of war. Relieved from picket at 6 A. M. and returned a few
                                    rods to the works. rain continued all day, falling very fast at times, almost
                                    overflowing our resting place. At 11 o'clock at night rain ceased to fall,
                                    and it became very cola. Our blankets and clothing being wet, caused considerable
                                    suffering.</p>
                        <p>October 2, Friday….No disturbance on the line: the rebels
                                    moving—changing position: some apprehensions of an attack: but no

                        <p>October 3, Saturday. At 8 A. M. 1st Brigade was relieved by the 2nd (we having been
                                    on duty since the 22 of Sept.) returned to 3d line of works near the edge of town,
                                    about 3/4 of a mile from the <geogName>Tennessee river</geogName>. little of note
                                    transpired during the day.</p>
                        <p>October 4, Sabbath. I got a pass and crossed the river after my Velise have been
                                    separated form my clothing for more than two weeks….Many men suffer
                                    severely having lost their blankets in the battle. All quiet during the day save two
                                    cannon shots fired at noon.</p>
                        <p>October 5, Monday. The day passed off quietly, until about noon, when the rebels
                                    opened on our works, with their artillery from the side of Lookout Mountain The
                                    firing was continued pretty brisk, during the afternoon, and at intervals during the

                        <p>October 6, Tuesday. Awoke early in the morning expecting the rebels to open on as
                                    with all their available artillery force, from the high commanding position they
                                    occupied on the side of Lookout Mountain: ranging from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 miles distant,
                                    but there was so much fog and smoke as to almost obscure the Sun-light, until 10, A.
                                    M. and so much so as to render cannonading impracticable, and useless, for either
                                    party. And yesterdays experiments, revealed to then the fact that their artillery
                                    was or, a position so much elevated, as to render it harmless to us: and almost
                                    useless, to them: save the annoyance their Shells gave us. One Shot fired from Ft
                                    Negley at 3, P. M. no reply from the rebels….one shot fired after night,
                                    after which all was again quiet as usual, during the night.</p>
                        <p>October 7, Wednesday…..but few Shots fired from our Batteries, without a
                                    reply.</p>
                        <p>October 8, Thursday. Morning very smoky until 10, A. M. Our artillery practiced a
                                    little in the after-noon throwing shells at the rebels, but few shuts, in reply. Day
                                    passed by pleasantly, quite different from the 8 of Oct. one year since, at which
                                    time we were engaged in the Battle of Perryville, Ky. [October 8, 1862.]</p>
                        <p>October 9, Friday. Morning cool and frosty, so much fog in the air as to render it
                                    almost dark until 10 o'clock A. M. A detail of 100 at work on the Forts as

                                    "Signal corps" on the summit of Lookout Mountain was seriously
                                    disturbed by the bursting of "Yankee Bomb's" in their

                                    distressing to see their condition—with legs, feet, arms and hand
                                    amputated, and wounds of every conceivable shape and form. They are being sent north

                                    were fired at "Lookout," and again at night a few more were filed,
                                    without receiving a reply from the rebel Batteries. At noon a detail, consisting of

                                    and cold, had no wood with which to make fires, suffered severely at night. Received

                                    M. were found wending our way northward, over ridges and through valleys, having
                                    been assigned to our post,—4 men to a wagon. The valleys were very
                                    narrow, the country stony and not very fertile or beautiful. Passed some beautiful
                                    Mountain Streams. Camped for the night at Cole's Tavern, at the foot of the

                        <p>October 17, Saturday…..At 12, M. ascended the hill, which was about a mile
                                    long, and very rough and steep. traveled about five miles on the mountain and
                                    camped, for the night.</p>
                        <p>October 18, Sabbath. Began the march early in the morning. it soon became cloudy and
                                    began to rain—rain with a vengeance. Thus we tuged our way across the
                                    mountain a distance of 12 miles, and down a distance of 3 miles, mud beyond
                                    discription. Having to wait often for other trains to pass, got along slow. The

                                    Camped about 2 miles from the foot of the mountain, in <geogName>Sequachie

                    Lieutenant Mayfield was among the soldiers wounded at this time. His descriptions of life in camp,
                    of the execution of deserters, and of the battle and battlefield are among the best passages found

                                    of the Regiment for what length of time I know not, consequently I have taken

                                    more than every before. I will now have to do a great deal of
                                    writing,—Making out "Monthly Returns," "Ration
                                    Returns," "Ordnance Reports" Muster and Pay Rolls, and
                                    doing many other kinds of company business….We are having very pleasant
                                    time here considering, what might be expected under the circumstances. Rations have
                                    been short since we came here, but the <geogName>Tennessee river</geogName> having
                                    been opened to within 5 or 6 miles of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, and having two Steamers to ply between Brideport and that point, makes
                                    the prospect very fair for better times, in the "grub" and
                                    clothing line.</p>
                        <p>The Rail Road is also open to within two or three miles of <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-039-2-060"/> this place but not repaired yet. The prospect for
                                    better times are very flattering. Have plenty of duty to do—on
                                    "picket" once every third day and "fatigue duty"
                                    the remainder of the time. But where this is realy necessary, as it has been here,
                                    it is considered no hardship. The rebel pickets stand within two hundred yards of
                                    ours, neither one firing, without some demonstrations on the part of the other are
                                    made. There has been, during the last week, some very warm fighting, down the river,
                                    caused by the advance of Hookers command, they succeeded well, but lost a number of
                                    men about 200. The cannons are roaring again to day as usual:—create no
                                    uneasyness whatever with us, we being so used to them. There has been no fighting in
                                    our immediate front for near three weeks. I can see the rebel camps very plain while
                                    siting in my "Hut" which by the way is a very
                                    "fine" little establishment composed principaly of Board with a

                        <p>November 2, Monday. During last night and this morning the rebels approached near to
                                    our lines and attempted to throw up earthworks, our batteries opened upon them near
                                    twelve o'clock. a battery within a few yards of our camp fired quite number
                                    of rounds during the day disturbing the rebels to a great degree. No reply from
                                    them. They fired a number of shots from the summit of Lookout Mountain in various
                                    directions, some at our picket detail as they went out this morning, doing no injury
                                    so far as I can learn….Mail arrives pretty regular again. About 8
                                    o'clock at night the Brigade was called out in line, and formed in the
                                    breastworks, (the diches of which were partialy filled with mud and water) as though
                                    an attack was expected, the rebels having been unusualy bold in their demonstrations
                                    during last night and to day. After standing in line until about half past 9
                                    o'clock were dismissed, and returned to quarters, about 100 yards distant.
                                    Quite a large detail was sent out to the front, near the picket line, to fortify
                                    (under cover of the night,) a position in which to use artillery, should the rebels
                                    persist in their attempt to fortify so near our lines.</p>
                        <p>November 3, Tuesday…..Detailed and reported for "pickt
                                    guard", at 6 1/2 A. M. Passed the regular routine of "Guard
                                    Mount"—Inspection and Review" in the meantime the
                                    "Brass Band" was discoursing music for us. The picket detail from
                                    the Brigade numbered about 300 men. About 11 A. M. the battery in Ft Negley opened
                                    on the rebels who were attempting to work The shells bursted so near to them as to
                                    cause them to break and run in wild confusion across the field like so many wild
                                    turkeys, with their heads tucked down. Some of them were known to be hurt. Shelling
                                    continued all day at intervals from Lookout Mountain, also our Batteries kept up a
                                    pretty brisk fire from Mockison Point, which is a hight point on an Island about one
                                    mile below <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, and almost opposite to Lookout Mountain. But few shots fired at night,
                                    all quiet on the lines, rebels very close by.</p>
                        <p>November 4, Wednesday….Relieved from picket at 8 A. M. A few artillery
                                    shots fired near noon continuing during the day at intervals….In the
                                    after noon the detail of 11 men from Co "I", <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-039-2-061"/> 112 from regiment, returned from Stevenson Ala. having
                                    been gone since the 15 of October, guarding a supply train. was happy to see them
                                    return home, after being absent so long a time. they were greeted by us, as the[y]
                                    would by their friends, should they be permitted to return home. Soldiers of a
                                    company, or regiment become attached to each other to such a degree as to cause them
                                    to act, (when meeting a companion of long absence,) as though he were a brother</p>
                        <p>November 5, Thursday…..Unusualy quiet to day. comparatively few cannon
                                    shots fired during the day.</p>
                        <p>November 6, Friday. Cannonading begins pretty early, principaly west of Lookout
                                    Mountain, all quiet in front….</p>
                        <p>November 7, Saturday. Quite an unusual amount of artillery firing to day, from the
                                    point of Lookout, and from Mockison point….Rations are a little more
                                    plenty, with better prospect ahead.</p>
                        <p>November 8, Sabbath. Slightly clouded today with a piercing wind astir, dashing the
                                    smoke to and fro, and entering every slight opening, in my Cottage, which by the way
                                    arc not so scarce. "Shelling" is the order of the day. none
                                    interfere with us. No indications of a collision between the contending armies. Two
                                    deserters came in this morning. know nothing, only the[y] do not want to fight</p>

                        <p>….News has come, almost to a stand point: and nothing is being done, save
                                    the regular routine of daily duties, which, by the way: includes cannonading. The
                                    rebels have a battery on the point of Lookout Mountain near 2400 feet above us and
                                    about 2 miles distant, from which they exert themselves to the utmost to injure us.
                                    The shells from that point burst high in the air doing no injury whatever</p>
                        <p>Our Batteries on Fort Negley near by us have been annoying the rebels a great deal
                                    this past week, while they were attempting to approach our lines with new
                                    fortifications they were in plain view of the picket line, and we could see the
                                    result of every Shot. One shell burst in a stack of guns, scattering them high in
                                    the air. I could see the men runing to the timber with all possible speed. Two
                                    deserters came in to that Station last night, and report that, at the bursting of
                                    that one shell, there was one Lieut killed and five men wounded. they then suspended
                                    operations until a more convenient season, and that season does not come often.</p>

                                    "Dress parade" at 4, P. M. wind blowing so severely as to make it
                                    difficult to stand in line.</p>
                        <p>November 10, Tuesday. Morning cold and frosty ground frozen, ice on standing water. I
                                    was detailed to work on one of the Forts, wind blew cool all day, labor was
                                    necessary to prevent suffering with cold yet on half rations. Very few shots fired
                                    to day—unusualy quiet—the rebels are geting tired of waisting
                                    amunition from the crest of Lookout Mountain.</p>
                        <p>November 11, Wednesday…..Very little cannonading until near night, when it
                                    was pretty brisk for hall an hour….</p>
                        <p>November 12, Thursday….there was some artillery practice in the direction
                                    of Lookout….</p>
                        <p>November 13, Friday….the brigade was called out to witness the execution
                                    of two "Deserters", one Benjamin of the 44 Ill. and one Daly of
                                    the 88th Ill. The brigade was formed in a hollow square in two lines, between which
                                    the procession marched: the convicts marching after their Coffins, the Brass Band
                                    playing a plaintive tune—all performed in solemn style. A file of men
                                    were drawn up in line, twelve in number, half of the peices charged with Blank
                                    cartridges. After the Parsons had waited upon them, they were seated upon their
                                    Coffins eyes blinded: the troops kneeled at which instant the guns fired, the men
                                    falling back, dying without a groan. It looked hard that men should thus be treated,
                                    but it cannot be doubted that they got their dues. The heavy fog and smoke prevented
                                    the rebels from shelling us, as they attemped, with marked effect. It was extremely
                                    warm about noon, at the time of the execution. But few shots fired during the day.
                                    Dress Parade every afternoon at 4, P. M.</p>
                        <p>November 14. Saturday…..Lieut Marshall received detail to go to Indiana on

                                    Seven Segts from the regiment. Cannonading in the vicinity of Lookout Mountain
                                    continued during the day.</p>
                        <p>November 15, Sabbath…..The day was occupied in receiving pay, for four
                                    months, ending 31st of October. At 7 o'clock A. M. Lieut Marshall began his
                                    journey northward. Some very brisk artillery firing in the afternoon, as usual doing
                                    no injury so far as heard from. Thus a Sabbath day was spent, receiving money and
                                    setling account; how long must this continue! not even the wisest of the nation can

                                    night, and a goodly number of them are Commissioned Officers. they run narrow risks
                                    in the attempt, are always fired upon by their own men and often by ours, mistaking
                                    the object of their approach. They report that there are many regiments, from which
                                    every man would willingly desert if there was an opportunity, but that they have
                                    three lines of sentinels in order to prevent this. The deserters report the rebels
                                    suffering for many articles which are necessary for the comfort of men. amongst
                                    other things they are very scarce of Pork, and Sugar and Coffee they have not. <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-039-2-063"/> If our soldiers happen to get without these

                        <p>17th This morning early the artillery broke out in good style up the river. the
                                    firing was terrific in the extreme for half an hour, then ceased and all is quiet in
                                    that direction I do not know either the cause of the firing or the result. But
                                    suppose that it was our forces attempting to lay a "Pontoon

                        <p>November 17, Tuesday. At the dawn of day, artillery "opened" on the
                                    left, in the vicinity of the river, continuing for about half an hour, in good
                                    order—terrific. it is reported that but one man on our side was hurt. It
                                    is said to have been brought about by an attempt on our part to span the river, with
                                    a pontoon bridge, with which they have been successful. If such be the case stiring
                                    news may be expected soon from this quarter of the Globe. May the good work continue

                                    Also a number of shots fired from Mockison Point.</p>
                        <p>November 18, Wednesday. I was detailed at 6% A. M. for fatigue duty, with 150 men, to
                                    work on Forts….About noon there were a few heavy volleys of musketry
                                    fired in the direction of Lookout mountain near the base, result unknown. Rev N. P.
                                    Charlott, (Chaplain of the regiment) started early this morning to Ind on business

                        <p>November 19, Thursday….but one or two shots fired from Lookout Mountain to
                                    day, rather singular for it has been their practice to keep up a continuous firing
                                    all day….<hi rend="i">Dress parade</hi> at 4 P. M.</p>

                                    m….About noon our artillery began shelling the rebels about t,he base of
                                    Lookout Mont The shots were well directed, as we could see the shells explode over
                                    the rebel works. The rebels did not reply. At noon received orders to have 80 rounds
                                    of cartridges, to the man, and two days cooked rations in haversacks by the
                                    following morning shortly after night were relieved from picket to make ready for
                                    the contemplated move, which was done, but at 9 o'clock the order was
                                    countermanded. we then retired quietly to rest.</p>
                        <p>November 21, Saturday…..Severel shots fired from Moccasin point to day but
                                    none from Lookout Mountain.</p>
                        <p>November 22, Sabbath. I with a detail of one hundred men, was sent out on
                                    picket….Early in the morning it was discovered that the rebels were
                                    moving heavy trains and troops eastward, over Mission Ridge, the summit of which is
                                    about three miles distant from our camp. There are five roads in view over which
                                    they passed. In the fore noon our heavy batteries, in "Ft Wood"
                                    opened upon them, <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-039-2-064"/> which first produced a
                                    defiant "yell," and finaly changing into fear and confusion. Our
                                    shelis were well directed, continuing during the entire day. The rebels were
                                    doubtless very much annoyed. There were a few shots fired from a small gun on
                                    Lookout Mountain, doing no injury whatever. no others were fired on the rebels side.
                                    Shortly after night we were relieved from picket, having received marching orders
                                    with two days rations and eighty rounds of cartridges The "11th Army
                                    Corps" came in to night. Shermans Corps has passed up the north bank of the

                        <p>November 23, Monday…..At 1 o'clock P. M. were called into line,
                                    and immediately formed a line of battle about 600 yards outside of the works, in an
                                    open field. the lines being formed, the left (Woods Division), pressed forward
                                    fighting their way, and advanced about 1 1/2 miles, securing a very strong position
                                    without much loss: in the mean time we advanced with little resistance. by night the
                                    new line was established and was hastily being fortified There was some nice
                                    artillery practice from our Forts in the afternoon. 10 o'clock at night a
                                    few shots were fired in our front, immediately all were to arms….</p>
                        <p>November 24, Tuesday. Morning frosty. Were aroused at 2 A. M. and moved farther to
                                    the left. At 10, A. M. the battle opened furiously near the western base of Lookout
                                    Mountain Our heavy guns on Moccasin point were speedily worked, and about 2, P. M.
                                    had the pleasure of seeing our forces coming around the point on the bench of
                                    "Lookout." The rebels were immediately charged out of their works
                                    on the east side of the mountain. Fighting continued heavy until about 10
                                    o'clock P. M. when all again became quiet. While this was being done,
                                    Sherman was crossing his forces near the mouth of Chickamauga which was done without
                                    resistance, on the part of the rebels. The loss has been light so far.</p>
                        <p>November 25, Wednesday. Heavy fighting on the extreme left early this morning, about
                                    noon our position was changed to the right. it was evident to my mind that there was
                                    something contemplated, from the disposition of the troops—as they were
                                    being massed about 2 miles from the summit of Missionary Ridge, in the timber. At 2,
                                    P. M. the signal shots were fired and the column, which was 5 or 6 miles in length;
                                    advanced together. The ascent of the ridge was very steep and about 1/2 mile high,
                                    with one line of rifle pits at the base, another, one third of the distance up,
                                    while the crest was lined with troops and heavy artillery, from which the advancing
                                    column, (three deep) were subjected to a raking fire, of shot Shell and canister.
                                    When within a mile of the first line of rebel works, the different columns started
                                    on the "double quick" which soon increased to the
                                    "run" immediately the rebel batteries opened, with telling effect,
                                    and would have done much injury had not been for our swift movements. The three
                                    lines rushed together into the rebel works, after having crossed the open field in
                                    very good order. The colum immediately pressed forward up the hill to the 2d Line of
                                    works, which were soon occupied, and again we pressed forward, for the crest, losing
                                    no time. Near this place seven of Co "I" were wounded being
                                    subjected to a heavy cross fire, from enemies artillery. I received a wound in the
                                    right arm when within on[e] hundred yards <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-039-2-065"/> of
                                    the crest of the hill The wounded were 1st Segt William B Miller, severely in right
                                    shoulder, Segt Moses St. Clair, severly in right side, Corpl Benj T Gardner,

                                    all told, Eight of whom were wounded. The 22nd lost but three killed and 32 wounded
                                    in the engagement, thus showing that my company lost near one fourth. The crest of
                                    the hill was gained at 4 1/2, P. M. Regiments were soon formed to repel an assault
                                    if one should be made by the rebels but their retreat was hasty and confused, with a
                                    loss of many—prisoners, and much artillery. Here we halted to replenish
                                    our stock of ammunition, which was greatly depleted, and also the
                                    "grub." before this was done orders were received to march in
                                    pursuit of the retreating enemy, followed to Chickamauga creek about 5 miles
                                    distant, and halted to await the arrival of "day
                                    light"….</p>
                        <p>November 26, Thursday. Marched up near the old Bridge, which had been partialy
                                    destroyed by the rebels, and where a temperary crossing was being constructed, and
                                    which was well nigh completed when Sheridans Division received orders to return to <placeName>

                                    our camp near night after having traveled about 8 miles, very steady march, and
                                    being very sore, since yesterdays, "Charge." Found the camp to be
                                    a pleasant resort. Good warm fire, and comfortable bed. At 9 o'clock P. M.
                                    received orders to be ready to march at 7 A. M. the following morning, which order
                                    was soon countermanded, until further orders. It was then a settled fact that there
                                    was no rest for us yet, we must march soon.</p>
                        <p>November 27, Friday. Morning dawned beautiful and quiet. The entire day passed off
                                    without even a rumor to mar the peace of wearied soldiers. My arm swelled very large
                                    from shoulder to hand settled Slack with bruised blood. Can not use it, have not
                                    been off duty yet. At night received orders to be ready to march at 7 A. M.

                        <p>November 28, Saturday. Morning cloudy and raining. Troops did not march until near
                                    noon, when it ceased to rain. The weather being very disagreeable, and my arm yet
                                    being very sore and painful, the Surgeon advised me to remain in camp, which was

                        <p>December 1, 1863, Tuesday…..Capt Moss and I took a pleasure excursion over
                                    the rebel camps and fortifications, and also over Misaionary Ridge. Found their
                                    camps to have been on low, wet, ground and very filthy; their works were very small,
                                    and a direct line, without an angle: with which to give an infilading fire. Showing
                                    a great lack of skill in engineering, or a degree of carelessness, which causes a
                                    failure in everything attempted. Missionary Ridge we found to be very steep, and
                                    rough, and the timber well marked with the deadly missiles, especialy the rebel
                                    works on the crest of the hill were well battered. Benj. T. Gardner, Co

                                    the assault of Missionary Ridge.</p>
                        <p>December 2, Wednesday…..Very little of importance afloat.</p>
                        <p>A very nice hull of a new steamer, which was captured from the rebels, came down the
                                    river to day, it will soon be put in running order.</p>
                        <p>December 3, Thursday…..At 11 A. M. crossed <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName> creek, which is a very deep stream with high banks, emptying into the
                                    Tenn. river at the base of Lookout Mountain, at which place the R. R. leading; from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to Bridgport crosses. At this point we, (Capt Moss and I) began to
                                    ascend the mountain which was very steep and rough, viewed the rifle pits and breast
                                    works, which the rebels had constructed during their occupation of the Mountain.
                                    Their defenses were good, beside the natural position of the country, which was
                                    decidedly in their favor. There are several roads runing around the point of the
                                    mountain none of which are very good. About 2/3 of the way up is a spot of cleared
                                    land, 40 or 50 acres,—one vast orchard of Fruit trees, and on which is
                                    situated, (the ground having been leveled down for that purpose,) a very nice
                                    residence, which bears the emblem of war, havir,g had five or six cannon shots to
                                    pass through it, thrown from our batteries on Moccasin Piont, situated on the north
                                    side, and in a bend of the river opposite to Lookout. This point is so named from
                                    its peculiar shape,—being that of a Moccasin complete. We ploded our way
                                    up the steep ascent and when within 100 feet of the crest, were compelled to climb
                                    ladders a portion of that distance. Reaching the top at 1 o'clock P. M.
                                    having been two hours on the way. The stone cliffs on the point are about 100 feet
                                    high, and the tops appear to project far out over the base. they are well marked
                                    with shots from our artillery. From this point <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                                    </placeName> with all its surroundings are distinctly visible. Our large forts
                                    situated on high commanding positions appear to be on a common level with other
                                    objects, and even Missionary Ridge loses its lofty appearance, when viewed from this
                                    point. The rebels had prepared themselves very well, having fortified every pass to
                                    the mountain, but so hasty was their retreat, that they left their tents, cooking
                                    utensils, and even the Officers many of their trunks. About one mile back, on the
                                    crest which is tolerably level and nice, is Summerville, a small village, noted as a
                                    pleasant summer retreat, and containing for the most part houses of entertainment,
                                    and preparation. for all kinds of amusement, has one very large nice Hotel. <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-039-2-067"/> After being satisfied with viewing the
                                    beauties, we decended on steps prepared for the purpose viewing the rebel earthworks
                                    as we returned, arriving at camp near night, wearied and suffering severely with my
                                    wound, the fatigue being to great.</p>
                        <p>December 4, Friday…..I, again searched diligently for Segt Miller, finding
                                    him in Johnson's Hospital. His wound is dangerous, he is suffering
                                    severely….</p>
                        <p>December 6, Sabbath…..At noon, accepted an invitation to dine with Capt.
                                    Moss,—given as a "Birth day" repast. Had a bountiful

                        <p>December 9, Wednesday…..My time occupied in a great degree, visiting 1st
                                    Segt William B. Miller, who was dangerously wounded, Nov 25, 1863, and whose
                                    recovery: can not be. Suffers severly, must die soon. Is, no doubt, prepared to meet
                                    his God!</p>
                        <p>December 10, Thursday…..Visited Segt Miller often during the day, saw that
                                    he must die, suffered much, breathed very hard. At 3 o'clock, P. M. his
                                    spirit took its flight, leaving the lifeless form of him, who was so highly
                                    respected—so dearly loved.</p>
                        <p>December 11, Friday. Segt Millers remains intered, by his friends, and Rev Charlott,
                                    who were in attendance, in a solemn and respectful manner, due the life he lived.

                                    were fired at Ft Wood, cause unknown, to me. I suppose it to be in honor of the

                        <p>…when I last wrote, my arm was paining me to much for me to realize what
                                    was written. It is now almost well, but not very stout yet. My health is very good,
                                    never was better. I have not heard from the regiment, since they left on the 28th of
                                    Nov. more than that they were at <placeName>

                                    here,—under Sherman—to Burnside caused Longstreet to raise the

                                    since I am able to travel. I love to travel in a mountainous country where I can get

                        <p>….I had not been absent from my company a single day for more than two
                                    years, until the 28 of Nov. when the regiment started to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> Tenn. I was somewhat vexed to think that a slight wound which would be
                                    well in a few weeks,—and which would not keep me from doing duty if they
                                    were to remain in camp,—should separate me from the company—my
                                    companions in arms. To be submissive and cheerful was all that could consistently be
                                    done.</p>
                        <p>The company numbers, 49 enlisted men, 35 of whom are present (with the regiment) for
                                    duty. Five of the remainder are on Detached duty, and Nine are in Hospitals. Six of
                                    whom are wounded. There were but three in Hospitals before the battle. The Captain,
                                    (A. R. Ravenscroft) is on detached service—in Ordnance Department, has
                                    been absent for more than a year. Lieut Marshall, is now at home on Recruiting
                                    service. I have not heard yet how he is succeeding, but he wrote to me that he was
                                    having to recruit in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Co. which I am confident is a hopeless case. I suppose that recruiting
                                    will not he wry fast at best.</p>
                        <p>I wish to know if you have an idea of enlisting. soon as you answer this I will write
                                    some particulars in the case. I have great fears of your ability to stand the
                                    service, as you failed in the first attempt. And where a family furnishes two
                                    soldiers, to the army, the third one should have the privilege of attaining an
                                    education. Rut after all the maintainance of the Nation is above all such pursuits.
                                    I continue to think as before that the rebellion will not last long. It is my desire
                                    that you remain at College and whenever your means are runing short, so as to
                                    interfere with your studies, let me know it, 2nd if it is possible (it is not often
                                    impossible) I will assist you cheerfuly—with all my heart.</p>
                        <p>You have perhapse e're this, received $20.00 I sent by express,
                                    if so you will use it, taking no thought of my need, for I always retain plenty for
                                    my own use. neither do I wish you to uneasy your mind about how you are to pay this
                                    in future. It is a gift, a free one too; and I ask no pay; more than that you apply
                                    it to secure an education for yourself, and when it is thus applied I will be
                                    paid,—bountifuly paid.</p>
                        <p>My health continues good. wound is almost well, but is not improving much now. I have
                                    pretty good use of my arm, can write without any serious pain. Rut I can not do
                                    much, (not even brush my clothes) without enterfering with a tender part.</p>
                        <p>In the late battle C. H. Coffey, as usual, got a message from rebeldom which relieved
                                    him of his canteen, penetrated his haversack and clothing and continued on its
                                    journey, harmless. He thought that it struck in a very tender place, cuting off his
                                    suply of water and interfering with the "grub sack." His health

            <p>General William T. Sherman was given command of <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-039-2-069"/> the three armies
                    concentrated at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and early in May, 1864, he began the campaign against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The second diary of Lieutenant Mayfield begins in March, when the Twenty-Second
                    Infantry was returning from a visit to Indiana. The troops were moved by train to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but from there they marched to their old camp at Chattanoogo. When Sherman's
                    advance began on May 6, the regiment left camp; and from this point the diary gives an eloquent
                    account of the campaign that must have seemed almost a continuous battle. Something of
                    Sherman's method of out. flanking his opponent is evident in Mayfield's
                    descriptions. Unfortunately for this record, the departure from this procedure in the attack at
                        <geogName>Kenesaw Mountain</geogName>, with its heavy casualties, resulted in the wounding of
                    Lieutenant Mayfield and the end of his diary. His brother, Joseph M. Mayfield to whom the letters
                    were written, had enlisted in Company I of the Twenty-Second and was killed in action in 1864; so
                    there are no more letters to give us a record of the remainder of the campaign. The Twenty-Second,
                    however, went on with Sherman to Savannah, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, and, when the war ended, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington, D. C.</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and thence to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where it was disbanded.</p>

                                    in the day the 16th Corps advances, drives the rebel skirmishers and takes
                                    possession of their outer works, fighting heavy and continuous. Artillery used
                                    extensively both here and on the extreme right. Were aroused at midnight by heavy
                                    skirmishing, indicating an attack—on the left of our front.</p>
                        <p>June 16, Thursday…..yet Lying in breastworks. At noon a detail for
                                    skirmishers, of 6 Co's including Co "I" from the 22nd
                                    Ind. was made. The skirmish line was half mile in front, the land being so thickly
                                    covered with wood and underbrush as to render it almost impassable. Deployed and
                                    took position on the line under a rapid fire from the reb guns. Skirmishing quite
                                    brisk along the entire line, more especialy on the left in front of the 16th corps.
                                    Heavy fighting on the right. Late in the afternoon got in to a conversation with the
                                    rebels in cur front,—44th Miss Sharpshooters,—in which there
                                    was a propposition to cease firing concented to-very quiet afterward. It was
                                    expected that this portion of the line was to be "charged" in the
                                    afternoon or night, and preparations were made accordingly. From 9 to 10 P. M.
                                    scarcely a shot was to be heard on the line. It was so <hi rend="i">uncommon as to
                                        attract</hi> the attention of the entire army, and was considered indicative of
                                    a storm. in the mean time we could hear the rebel artillery
                                    moving—shifting position—while at another place they were at
                                    worship—singing and could be heard very distinctly. at 11
                                    o'clock a weak charge was made on the left which brought us to our posts

                                    volley after volley of shot and shell, whole batteries firing at the same instant.
                                    It was the most terrific that I ever witnessed Prom one side alone. The smoke soon
                                    became very thick. In the mean time heavy musketry was heard on the right. a charge
                                    was made but by whom, and the result is unknown. From camp rumors it would appear
                                    that desertions from the rebel army continue numerous. Fortified our position which

                        <p>June 22, Wednesday…..At 8 a.m. the rebels, on Kenesaw Ridge in our
                                    immediate front, opened on our works with several batteries. The firing was very
                                    rapid and exciting. Shells flew thick over heads bursting in the woods behind. Some
                                    droped among our tents, others bursted high in air. This state of affairs continued
                                    near all day Our batteries, except those far to the right, did not reply, the time
                                    being occupied in preparing works. We were annoyed considerably by stray minie
                                    balls, str[ag]gling through our home. At night cannon ceased firing, skirmishing
                                    more brisk. At 9 P. M. marched to the right, and at 1 A. M. returned to our own
                                    works. Immediately after halting rebel shells were droped thick and fast in an open
                                    field through which we had passed, soon ceased. There was heavy firing in the

                                    soon quiet. At 9 A. M. a shot was fired which the rebels soon replied to from the
                                    ridge. our batteries opened with such vigor and precision that the rebels could fire
                                    but 3 shots. They are very still. At 5 P. M. the opened again from the ridge the

                        <p>June 25, Saturday…..At 10 A. M. the rebels opened on our camp and works
                                    with their Artil on the ridge, lodging some of the shells in the works, while others
                                    bursted in front, rear, above and in the midst of our tents, scattering the whizing

               <hi rend="i">The Life of Johnny Reb</hi>. By Bell Irvin Wiley. (The Bobbs-Merrill Company, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, 1943. Pp. 444. Illustrations. $3.50.)</head>
            <p>This attractive volume is not made up of edited source matter, but is a carefully written book based
                    on an extensive and close study of contemporary documents. Quotations from letters, diaries,
                    newspapers, and other sources enrich the text; but everything dovetails into the author's
                    own story in which he presents the activities, thoughts, and problems of Confederate soldiers as he
                    sees them after much patient research. The chapter headings are brief and suggestive. As the reader
                    proceeds, he comes to know "Johnny Reb" quite intimately and arrives at an
                    understanding of his strong points, his temptations, his hardships, his habits, his fighting
                    qualities, and his reactions to the smaller and larger aspects of the conflict. In regard to
                    sanitation, care of sick and wounded, food, clothing, sleeping facilities, religion, whisky, women,
                    heroism, cowardice, profanity, fellowship, discipline, the folks back home, and a host of other
                    things pertaining to the life of the soldiers of the South, an honest attempt is made to paint the
                    picture as it was—no better, no worse.</p>
            <p>Dr. Bell does not hesitate to interpret his sources and his account contains many conclusions
                    presented for the enlightenment of his readers. Considering the nature of the sources and the
                    extensive study necessary to extract their meaning, the method of presenting his gleanings used by
                    the author is entirely justifiable. The last chapter, entitled "What Manner of
                    Men," was the most difficult to write. The preceding chapters deal with the varied phases
                    of the lives of Confederates, but in the final chapter an attempt is made to sum up the findings.
                    This chapter, like the others, must be read to be appreciated. Probably those who know little about
                    the Civil War as well as those who know much will agree with Dr. Bell that "The average
                    Rebel private belonged to no special category"; that "He was in most respects an
                    ordinary person"; that, though he was far from perfect, "his achievements against
                    great odds in scores of desperate battles through four years of war is an irrefutable evidence of
                    his prowess and an eternal monument to his greatness as a fighting man."</p>

            <p>To one who has read many letters, diaries, and other first-hand accounts relative to the Union
                    soldier who was pitted against Johnny Reb, there is no avoiding the conclusion that a volume on the
                    life of the "Damned Yankee" would closely parallel the work under review. The
                    sources are very similar in nature and quality. The thoughts, temptations, problems, and experiences
                    of the men who made up the Blue and Grey armies were of the sane pattern. Insofar. as they thought
                    about or expressed themselves on the issues at stake, the language would have to be phrased
                    differently: but as to the men, they were as much alike as soldiers of opposing forces possibly
                    could be. This is simply further evidence that the soldiers on both sides were men of the same
                    country who were called on to wage a war that should never have been fought.</p>

                    400 escaped across the river, and the remnant was captured. Morgan, his officers, and about 250 of
                    his men were confined as common criminals in the penitentiary at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, from which the raider and five of his officers subsequently made a sensational escape.</p>
            <p>In this interesting book by Cecil F. Holland the greater part of three chapters is devoted to the
                    northern escapade, <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-039-2-086"/> whereas the remainder is devoted to
                    characterization of the personnel, to the organization by Morgan of his regiments, and to three
                    other important raids directed at his own beloved Bluegrass region in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It is certainly evident from the pages of this book that General Morgan had all the daring reckless
                    courage and trickery and much of the glamour of his eastern prototype, Jeb Stuart. As evidence of
                    this, Holland, taking his information from contemporary newspaper accounts, tells, among others, the
                    following amazing tale. Morgan and three hundred of his horsemen suddenly swooped down upon an
                    unnamed Indiana town presumably being protected by 300 local militiamen. "Whose company is
                    this?" inquired an aged Hoosier captain. "Wolford's [Federal]
                    cavalry," a Confederate replied. Thereupon the captain walked over to Morgan and saluted.
                    "Colonel, how are you?"</p>
            <p>"Bully! How are you?" replied the raider. "What are you going to do with
                    all these men and horses?"</p>
            <p>"Well, you see, that damned horse-thieving John Morgan is in this part of the country with a
                    parcel of cutthroats and thieves, and betwen you and I, if he comes this way, Captain,
                    we'll give him the best we've got in the shop….Colonel Wolford, spose
                    while you're restin' you and your company put your saddles on our horses and go
                    through a little evolution or two by the way of a lesson to our boys. I'm told
                    you're a horse on the drill, and the only man Morgan is afraid of."</p>
            <p>Morgan and his men obliged, made a quick change from their wornout horses to the fresh ones, and to
                    the everlasting amazement of the Home Guards, made off leaving "their frail tenement of.
                    bones" tied to the fence.</p>
            <p>Holland draws heavily upon the press comments which throughout the Old Northwest were excruciatingly
                    caustic and bitter in their attacks upon Morgan. The press regarded the raid as a cruel, marauding
                    expedition that served no legitimate military purpose, and as an intolerable desecration of the free
                    soil of the North. But to use the author's summary words: "The expedition, even if
                    it had ended in failure, drew off some of the forces which might have harassed Bragg's
                    retreat from Middle <placeName>

                    </placeName> and helped Rosecrans at the battle of Chickamauga later on."</p>
            <p>The book as a whole is well documented. The author has <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-039-2-087"/> had
                    access to many materials not heretofore used, most important of which are Morgan's official

            <p>Many Americans, whose boys are in the armed forces today, will find much of interest in the record of
                    Theodore Upson, a Hoosier boy who entered the Union army and marched through <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> with General Sherman. The record, begun in 1858, reflected the mounting hostility to
                    slavery and the South in the minds of the people of northern Indiana. Entering the army at sixteen,
                    Upson described his experiences in camp at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, before the 100th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, of which he was a member, was

                    </placeName>. Transferred to Vicksburg, Upson was fortunate in getting into the town almost
                    immediately after its surrender. He was then sent to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                    </placeName> area, where he became a scout and hence saw more of the country and had more thrilling
                    experiences than was the lot of the common soldier. It seems that he had the happy facility of being
                    where important things were happening. He saw the charge up Missionary Ridge at the battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From there he went with Sherman and was present at the battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He continued as a scout in Sherman's army until the end of the war. At the
                    very close he was permitted to go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in advance of the army and so gave an interesting description of the capital as the war
                    ended. His youth and his ability seem to have appealed to his comrades and his superiors; as a
                    result, his writings contain interesting details not usually found in a private's diary.</p>
            <p>Upson wrote the present record sometime after the Civil War, using diaries, journals, and letters
                    written at an earlier time. It is this, no doubt, that makes it such an interesting <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-039-2-088"/> combination of youthful expression and mature judgment. The editor has
                    divided it into sections and paragraphs, furnished topic captions and punctuation, and modified
                    capitalization according to modern standards. This revision by the author and the editor has
                    increased its readability, but it has also introduced changes in the original and contemporary
                    documents. It may well be that its usefulness has been only slightly lessened for the historian and
                    considerably increased for the general reader by this procedure. A slight imperfection appears in
                    the entry dated "[Summer], 1860," which relates events of the fall of 1860 and
                    tells of the election of <placeName>

            <p>The "Watchdog of the Treasury," William Steele Holman, was southeastern
                    Indiana's contribution to the national scene in the days of "Uncle Joe"
                    Cannon, William McKinley, and "Czar" Reed. At times he appeared unnecessarily
                    parsimonious, as, for instance, when opposing adequate appropriations for developing the diplomatic
                    and consular service or for housing the library of Congress, or again, when walking back to
                    Bismarck, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ndu">North Dakota</country>
                    </placeName>, to save the government steamboat fare. At other times he saved large sums of the
                    taxpayers' money from greedy politicians, lobbyists, and contractors. His years of
                    membership in the House of Representatives totaled more than those of any other representative
                    before him. Altogether, his accomplishments seem quite significant.</p>
            <p>He began his Congressional career in 1858 as a Democrat belonging to the Douglas wing of his party.
                    As a war Democrat he supported the prosecution of the Civil War and the preservation of the Union
                    but was very critical of Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Republican party.</p>
            <p>In retirement from 1865 to 1867, he returned to Congress for the remainder of the Reconstruction
                    period to 1877. <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-039-2-089"/> Opposed as he was to the Radical Republicans,
                    he was also unable to agree completely with President Johnson, although he voted against his
                    impeachment. His insistence upon economy began to be quite noticeable in this period. He was also
                    antagonistic to land grants to railroads, to the national banking system, to the contraction of the
                    currency, and to the "salary grab." Reform of civil service and the land system
                    drew his support.</p>
            <p>After a four years' absence, he was regularly reelected to the House of Representatives from
                    1881 to 1895. Opposing the extravagant appropriations of' this period, he gained national
                    fame as the "Watchdog of the Treasury." He considered unnecessary and sought to
                    prevent large naval expenditures and the enlargement of governmental services. As chairman of a
                    committee to investigate the expenditure of appropriations for the Indians, he contributed to the
                    passage of the Dawes Act of 1887, which inaugurated the modern Indian policy of the federal
                    government. He also supported the establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commissiom. He was
                    reelected in 1896, but death ended his long career early in the following year.</p>
            <p>There is a certain appropriateness in this unpretentious and solid biographical treatment of a plain
                    and unpretentious man, but one might suggest that the author could have made his work more
                    interesting by a greater emphasis upon the unique and picturesque features of his subject.</p>
            <p>The first two chapters of this work, which contain a brief sketch of Holman's father, Jesse
                    Lynch Holman, will probably draw more criticism than the remainder of the volume. The author had
                    less to work with in these chapters and his style reflects the fact. Probably the work should have
                    been restricted to the life of William S. Holman.</p>
            <p>The book is quite free from factual or typographical errors. Generally the author is critical of the
                    younger Holman, but the sketch of the elder leans too heavily upon obituary notices and other
                    complimentary remarks. Railroad regulation was omitted from the list of important Populist demands
                    (p. 216)' and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s early policy was described in these words: "President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> merely waited as had Buchanan [p. 95]." Occasionally the narrative is marred
                    by ambiguity (pp. 193, 212). The footnotes are placed near the end of the volume, <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-039-2-090"/> an arrangement which penalizes the careful reader. The bibliography is
                    neither critical nor annotated.</p>
            <p>Readers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> will find that this book will make a
                    contribution to their knowledge, particularly of Indiana history. The lives of the Holmans extended
                    throughout the nineteenth century and illustrated many aspects of Indiana history. This biography is
                    an important addition to the historical literature of the state.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> officials during the war years. Perhaps the most valuable <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-039-2-091"/> parts of this volume are the five chapters which deal with economic and
                    financial matters: "Wartime Finance, 1861–1863"; "The
                    Financial Collapse"; "The Struggle for Economic Independence";
                    "Planter and Farmer in Wartime"; and "The Trade Through the
                    Lines." The lack of specie and the need for a circulating medium of exchange incited
                    legislative attempts to help the financial life of the state by the issuance of state paper. Such
                    attempts for the most part were disastrous, although, as Professor Bettersworth shows, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> state notes depreciated less rapidly than Confederate currency. The twin evils of
                    speculation and inflation added to the hardships of war suffered by the ordinary people, Too, the
                    very presence of the negro slaves on large plantations was an economic liability. The curtailing of
                    cotton production during the war left the negroes virtually useless as sources of profit. As
                    "non-producing consumers" they became a drag upon a way of economic life which had
                    been reduced to a subsistence economy by the circumscriptions and privations of war.</p>
            <p>Professor Bettersworth has used the available manuscript and printed sources with skill and
                    painstaking care. His interpretations are usually backed by a more than adequate array of sound
                    evidence. It is to be regretted, however, that his style of writing leads him into devious paths of
                    circumlocution which often obscure significant statements. Too, the author frequently predicates his
                    narrative upon an assumption of a familiarity with certain not-too-basic facts, supposing a
                    knowledge which even the professional historian may not always have. These minor flaws, while
                    detracting from the book in the eyes of the general reader, in no way impair the very real
                    excellence of <hi rend="i">Confederate <placeName>

               </hi>. Dr. Bettersworth is to be commended for having done an excellent piece of
                    research, which reveals with piercing clarity the manifold political, social, and economic problems
                    facing the state of <placeName>

            <p>In writing <hi rend="i">The Little Giant</hi>, Mrs. Nolan has created a biography which is at once
                    entertaining and instructional to a <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-039-2-092"/> wide range of readers. For
                    the adult who knows the story of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Douglas, it provides a stimulating and refreshing experience. For the younger
                    reader it should make much more real and human the purely political and uninspiring story which he
                    will be expected to learn from his high school history book.</p>
            <p>In this biography state and national politics are pictured as forces which make great statesmen.
                    While the career of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> is secondary to that of Douglas throughout the story, the certainty of the conflict
                    between them is very early made clear. At first the political issues of the times appear to be made
                    to order for the display and exercise of Douglas' prowess. But as time goes on he becomes
                    less and less the master politician and more and more the man with a mission. In contrast, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> seems from the first to stand squarely on the moral issue of slavery, with political
                    interests playing a somewhat secondary role in his conduct. But the significant thing about Mrs.
                    Nolan's story lies in its gradually unfolding conception of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Douglas not as men with fundamentally conflicting purposes but as men with opposing
                    solutions for a problem endangering the Union, for which they would both sacrifice themselves.</p>
            <p>While not every reader may agree with this interpretation of Mrs. Nolan's story, none can
                    fail to note its emphasis on the sincerity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Douglas and their mutual respect for each other throughout the years. The work of
                    Douglas in holding <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> for the Union, even after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s inauguration, is a story not always known, even to many adult readers. The
                    same is true of Douglas' reason for wanting to organize the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> territory, a point which Mrs. Nolan explains at length.</p>
            <p>Other historical sidelights, which are brought into the narrative naturally and effectively, include
                    stories about such men as Andrew Jackson, who, as Douglas' guiding spirit from early youth,
                    is painted as a very human but very great figure. In contrast, Buchanan's disloyalty to his
                    party is forcefully presented; and the causes of the Mexican War, discussed earlier in the story,
                    are described simply and frankly. Of course, the excitement of state and national campaigns is
                    pictured vividly, and the famous debates are treated in detail as political events of the time.</p>
            <p>But with all its attention to politics and national problems <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-039-2-093"/>
                    this biography is still the story of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Douglas. Out of seemingly insignificant but really portentious events
                    Douglas' strong character and his democratic philosophy develop. In sharp contrast to his
                    background and in much less detail stands that of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, sketched in skillfully from time to time as the occasion demands and with increasing
                    indication of his great destiny.</p>
            <p>To this skill in characterization and to her careful historical workmanship, evident in <hi rend="i">The Little Giant</hi>, Mrs. Nolan adds a style of writing admirably adapted to her subject.</p>

            <p>The people of Indiana should find this biography of the founder of Arbor Day very interesting and
                    significant. It is the story of one of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>'s pioneer statesmen who became secretary of agriculture in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s second administration and whose political career was cut short by that other
                    leader of the Cornhusker State, William Jennings Bryan. Born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and raised in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, Morton attended the Wesleyan Seminary at Albion, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, and the state university at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ann Arbor</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From the latter he was expelled before graduation, as the result of criticism growing
                    out of the dismissal of a member of the faculty. The occasion was less discreditable to him than to
                    the university and it revealed a young man with a strong, determined character.</p>
            <p>He soon became a pioneer settler in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, where he quickly reacted against his environment and the times by criticizing the
                    conduct of the Civil War and joining the party of the opposition. As a politician he was a failure,
                    but as an agriculturist he succeeded. Always a conservative, he opposed the Grange and the Alliance
                    and all for which they stood. For many years he served the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Burlington</settlement>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad as publicist, lobbyist, and agent. He was for a time the leading member of the
                    Democratic party in the state, but he favored the railroads and opposed the radicals, particularly
                    William J. Bryan. Often he made considerable sacrifices of time and money for his party, but he
                    preferred to see it defeated rather than to see it win under Bryan's leadership. As an
                    outstanding agriculturist and conservative <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-039-2-094"/> Democrat from west
                    of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, he was chosen by Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> to be the secretary of agriculture in his cabinet in the second term,
                    1893–1897.</p>
            <p>After the nomination of Bryan as the Democratic candidate for president and his defeat, Morton became
                    active in the National Sound Money League. He began the publication of <hi rend="i">The
                    Conservative</hi> on July 14, 1898, "in the interest of the conservation of all that is
                    deemed desirable in the social, industrial and political life of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." He wrote that "Riches and capital are nothing but the result of
                    industry and thrift," although he well know how railroads facilitated matters before
                    legislatures by the contribution of money for campaign purposes and indeed must have known of more
                    reprehensible uses which were prevalent in his state. He hoped to have a part in the formation of a
                    conservative party, but those who aided other of his activities would not join in this endeavor. No
                    doubt the railroad interests were too realistic to desire such a division in politics, when they had
                    done fairly well in finding leaders to represent them in both of the older parties.</p>
            <p>The most important defect of this book is that the author did not see what Morton also failed to see:
                    that the farmers, hard pressed by climatic and economic conditions, were being exploited by the
                    railroads of the West even to the point of tragedy. Indeed, Morton was not only a conservative but
                    he was also an agent of the railroads in defeating the citizens of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> in the use of political agencies to check this exploitation. His enemies called him a
                    railroad "tool." Morton's ability deserved greater rewards than he
                    received; the explanation is to be found in his rejection by the people of the state because he
                    chose to serve the railroads rather than the people. It seems quite possible, however, that his
                    political activity, which consumed so much of his energy, will be forgotten as a struggle against
                    the dominant tendencies of his day, and that his work in planting trees and founding Arbor Day will
                    prove to be his important contribution to his state and nation.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the above-mentioned defect is due to the materials used. The extensive Morton Collection of
                    manuscripts of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> Library must have consumed much of the author's time. The list of newspapers
                    used is fairly comprehensive, but there is not a representative of the <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-039-2-095"/> Farmers' Alliance on the list, although the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> State Historical Society possesses several such files. There are also certain theses
                    which represent this side of <placeName>

                    assumed not to have been used.</p>
            <p>In most other respects the work is admirably done. It is well written, amply documented, and very
                    adequately supplied with illustrations and possesses a good index and an excellent format. It has
                    been carefully proofread and is not marred by the little slips that detract from so many works. The

            <p>The early history of southern Indiana is one of fine pioneers, who, after constructing homes,
                    insisted on a place of worship and a school, who observed the law and respected property. Many of
                    their descendants have quietly fashioned our state. Wherever others settled, they have done their
                    share to better their communities.</p>
            <p>This book is the brief chronicle of one such remarkable family—the French Swiss founders
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana—whose personalities stand out delightfully, as related by a
                    great-granddaughter living today in the ancestral home.</p>
            <p>It is the record of five sturdy sons and three daughters of the one-time judge and mayor of Montreux, <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, whose eldest son, Jean Jacques Dufour, having read, as a lad of fourteen, that <placeName>

                    the vine in the new world.</p>
            <p>In 1796 he landed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and late in 1800 selected sixty-three acres in Jessamine County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, for his experiment. He named this land "First Vineyard." The
                    following year his brothers and sisters left their comfortable home in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> to join him in the wilderness, with their father's admonition to respect and
                    obey their eldest brother, to have preaching as often as they could, to read the ninetieth <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-039-2-096"/> Psalm when preaching was impossible, and to read this Psalm at
                    funerals. This last custom is still carried out by all his descendants. With the Dufour children,
                    all under twenty, came other French Swiss to the "First Vineyard"—the
                    Borally family, Philippe Bettens and his family, the Siebenthals, father and son, and Jean Morerod.
                    By 1813 all the colony had moved to better land on the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, to
                    "Indiana Vineyard," twenty-five hundred acres purchased by the Dufour brothers
                    from Congress on extended credit.</p>
            <p>Jean Francois and Jean Daniel Dufour now laid out the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in 1814 gave two town lots and $2500 to secure it as the county seat.
                    They supplied the deficit for the erection of the first courthouse and jail and established the
                    first bank, the first post office, and the first newspaper. Jean Daniel was one of the first three
                    directors of the first literary society of the town. Every Sabbath he read to the colonists sermons
                    many of which had been written by his father and sent from <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>. These two brothers became the most prominent citizens, held many public offices, and
                    built fine homes, which still stand.</p>
            <p>Antoinette Dufour married Jean Daniel Morerod. In their poorer days they had no cow; when unable to
                    obtain milk from their neighbors for their morning coffee they simply inhaled the odor of the coffee
                    from the rag in which it was pounded.</p>
            <p>The next sister, Suzanne, married a Swiss man by the name of Elisha Golay, prominent in civic and
                    military lines. Jeanne Marie married a Siebenthal, who became the first sheriff of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County and a leading member of the Swiss settlement.</p>
            <p>The American preference for whisky dampened the ardor for grape growing, and the colonists turned to
                    farming and other pursuits. Although Jean Jacques Dufour's original plans were never
                    fulfilled, he helped establish this thriving colony; and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> today has many mementoes of its early fathers, who founded and carried on a settlement
                    of which the state of Indiana is justly proud.</p>

            <p>The task of bridging the gap from the events described on the final pages of textbooks to the present
                    day is often a difficult one for the teacher of history. This is particularly true of teachers who
                    find it necessary to use older editions of texts. Likewise, many persons find it difficult to
                    arrange in their memory a systematic scheme of events in these hurried and busy times. This little

                    about the outbreak of the present war. It stresses the foreign relations phase of our history but
                    does not neglect the the domestic story. It also contains a brief bibliography of recently published

                    </placeName>. In 1816 he was elected to the convention which met in Corydon to frame the
                    state's first constitution. He also served in the House of Representatives of Indiana in
                    the sessions of 1816–1817, 1825, and 1827–1828, and in the Senate,
