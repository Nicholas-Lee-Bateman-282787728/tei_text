            <p>ON September 17, 1786, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Garrard county</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, there was born to Bazaleel Maxwell and his wife, Margaret Anderson, a son who was
                    destined to become a factor in the formation and early development of one of the great States which
                    was carved from the Northwest Territory.</p>
            <p>The history of the forebears of David Harvey or Hervey Maxwell, for such was the name with which this
                    son was christened, is that of the Scotch Presbyterians, who, persecuted by King James for one
                    hundred years or more after the year 1600, crossed the Irish channel to build homes for themselves
                    and families in the north of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>. And their decendants in turn, through a period of one hundred years after 1700, unable
                    longer to endure the burdens of civil and religious oppression in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ulster</settlement>
                    </placeName>, sought homes in far-away America.</p>
            <p>So it was that about the year 1745, John Maxwell and his wife. Fanny Garner, grandparents of David
                    Hervey Maxwell, came from County Londonderry to the colony of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, and down through the Shenandoah valley to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Albermarle county</region>
                    </placeName>, Virgiuia. Here on December 20, 1751, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Bazaleel Maxwell, father of David Hervey Maxwell, was born, and in 1775 was married to
                    Margaret Anderson, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rockbridge county</region>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In an old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> record one finds Bazaleel Maxwell figuring in a land survey of the 16th of June, 1785,
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln county</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, on the waters of Silver creek. Was it a land grant <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-008-3-002"/> that had been issued to him for military services in the State or colonial line that attracted
                    him to that far-away country, or was he lured by the marvelous tales of Daniel Boone to the land
                    across the mountains called the "dark and bluidy ground"?</p>
            <p>Be that as it may, we know that Bazaleel Maxwell, with wife and small family, crossed the great
                    "blue western wall," suffered the hardships of cold and encountered the dangers of
                    the wilderness road, but finally reached that "fairest of promised lands, the delectable
                    country Kaintuckee." It was under these skies, among rude surroundings and in primitive
                    conditions, that the child David saw the light of day. His boyhood was that of the pioneer of the
                    period. He helped his father to clear the forests, till the ground, hunt game and watch for the
                    redskins. Though opportunities were few his early education was not neglected. It was such as the
                    schools of the time afforded, supplemented by instruction at home. At the age of eighteen he was
                    sent to school at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which even at that early day was noted for the superior educational advantages it
                    offered over other localities in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. While here it is said of him that "he became well versed in mathematics, and
                    was an excellent well-read English, though not a classical, scholar."</p>
            <p>Later at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName> he studied medicine under Dr. Ephriam McDowell, one of the most noted surgeons of that
                    or of any time. Dr. McDowell's name is so eminent in medical annals that to relate an
                    incident of him in passing may not be out of place. It was he who, in 1809 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, first in the history of surgery performed the operation of ovariotomy. Himself a
                    deeply religious man, it is related of him that he offered up a prayer when all things were in
                    readiness. Then without the aid of an anesthetic to relieve his heroic patient, but with the courage
                    of his convictions and profound faith in his diagnosis, he skillfully removed a great tumor from a
                    Mrs. Crawford. On the outside an angry mob awaited to kill "the butcher" should
                    the woman die. It was many years before surgeons at home or abroad conceded the honor of this to Dr.
                    McDowell. The medical world was chagrined that this operation had been so daringly and successfully
                    performed in a back settlement of America, instead of in <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-008-3-003"/> one of
                    the scientific centers of Europe. It is believed that David H. Maxwell witnessed this operation.</p>
            <p>We now find him a young physician entering on the practice of his profession and ready to take unto
                    himself a wife. He was married on September 21, 1809, to Mary E. Dunn, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a daughter of Samuel Dunn, originally from County Down, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>. That the young couple at once set up a home for themselves is evidenced from a bill of
                    sale (now one hundred years old) found among some family archives dated four days after their
                    wedding. Strange reading this yellow bit of paper is in the light of to-day:</p>
            <p>"Know all men by these presents that I, Bazaleel Maxwell, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, do sell and by these presents have bargained and sold to David H. Maxwell, of the
                    county and State aforesaid, one negro woman named Sal, of 18 years of age, for the sum of
                    $350.00 current money of <placeName>

                    hereunto set my hand and seal this 25th day of September, 1809.</p>

            <p>In 1810 Dr. Maxwell moved to Indiana Territory near the present site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He practiced medicine here and at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> until the spring of 1819. Twice during these years he was called to public service.</p>
            <p>He was a surgeon in the war of 1812 in the company of his brother-in-law, Captain Williamson Dunn. In
                    the ranging service he traversed the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> country from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Fort Harrison, and on to the Mississinewa towns. At a time of high water he had the
                    misfortune to lose his surgical instruments. He was afterward reimbursed by Congress for this loss.</p>
            <p>In 1816 Congress passed an enabling act authorizing an election of delegates who were to determine
                    whether or not a State <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-008-3-004"/> government should be formed in the
                    Territory. Dr. Maxwell was elected a delegate from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson county</region>
                    </placeName> to this convention. One finds him next an active participant in the framing of a
                    constitution at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Corydon</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Vision had come to this man, of whom his contemporaries said he was profoundly read in
                    his favorite study, politics. He had been a slaveholder in an environment friendly to the
                    institution. He was now the friend of freedom, and drafted that clause of the constitution which
                    prohibited slavery forever from the State.</p>
            <p>Dr. Maxwell was interested in all the provisions of the constitution, but it is known from his
                    subsequent life that Article IX lay nearest his heart. That article made it the duty of the General
                    Assembly "as soon as circumstances will permit to provide by law for a general system of
                    education, ascending in a regular gradation from township schools to a State university wherein
                    tuition shall be gratis and equally open to all." The fulfillment of this provision
                    dominated the rest of this man's life. An item of interest in connection with Dr. Maxwell
                    as a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1816 is that the manuscript copy of the constitution
                    is in his handwriting. This copy is in the State Library at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>From the time that President Madison designated a township in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">the county</region>
                    </placeName> of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> for the use of a seminary of learning, Dr. Maxwell's attention was turned
                    toward this place. He bought a lot in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1818 and moved from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> in May, 1819. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> has been described as a town in name only at this time. A wagon road ran east and west
                    on what is now Kirkwood avenue. The public square was an unbroken forest, while the public spring
                    was down the hill, through the woods to a place which is now Eighth and Morton streets. The few
                    inhabitants faced the hardships of living in the wilderness. Indians were all around them. They were
                    dependent for meat upon deer and bear, which were killed in the hills of Salt creek and Bean
                    Blossom.</p>
            <p>From an old receipt showing the payment of rent in full, one finds that Dr. Maxwell on arrival rented
                    a log cabin from Aquilla Rogers, grandfather of L. D. Rogers. This cabin stood on the <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-008-3-005"/> northwest corner of the lot now occupied by the Kirkwood block,
                    formerly the National Hotel. Again Dr. Maxwell established his household, took up the practice of
                    his profession and became active in the promotion of the little community's interests. His
                    young wife, brought up in a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> home surrounded by slaves, knew nothing of the hardships of life until she came to this
                    outpost of civilization. True, she brought with her a colored man and woman, Dick and "big
                    Maria," but they could not relieve her of the care of her children, nor of the
                    responsibilities of the home. Her husband a physician, called hither and thither, was oftentimes
                    many miles from home. She spun and made the clothing for her little ones. Anxiety for their safety
                    was never absent from her mind. The Indians, though not unfriendly, were a constant annoyance, and
                    sometimes, in their drinking revels, a positive cause for alarm.</p>
            <p>In September, 1819, the First Presbyterian Church was established in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with nine charter members. The preliminary meeting was held in Dr. Maxwell's
                    log cabin, and the church was formally organized the following Sunday in the log courthouse. Dr.
                    Maxwell and his wife were charter members of this church, and three of their children, Martha A.,
                    James Darwin and Samuel Franklin, were baptized at this time.</p>
            <p>Later Dr. Maxwell built a two-story house—the first brick in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>—on what is now North College avenue. This was known, in after years, as the
                    Dr. Lucas property. Here his younger children were born, and later several of his daughters were
                    married.</p>
            <p>The winter of 1819-'20 arrived, and the fourth session of the General Assembly convened on
                    December 6. Dr. Maxwell, ever alert and filled with zeal and energy for the cause of education, did
                    not lose sight of the township of land designated for the use of a seminary of learning, which lay
                    one quarter of a mile south of the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>; nor did he forget this further fact that the four years had expired which the
                    constitution required that the lands set apart for educational purposes should be withheld from
                    sale. He at once set out on horseback, in midwinter, for Corydon, to procure if possible the
                    location of the State <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-008-3-006"/> Seminary at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was a personal friend of Governor Jennings, and had many acquaintances among the
                    members of the Legislature who had sat with him in the Constitutional Convention. History says that
                    Dr. Maxwell composed the "third house of the Assembly." That he was a successful
                    lobbyist was shown by an act passed on January 20, 1820, establishing the State Seminary at a point
                    in what is now Perry township. As one looks back upon that primitive day, at the physical condition
                    of the country, the social environment of the people, the illiteracy and poverty of the masses, one
                    wonders that even courage, perseverance and steadfast purpose of the few, made an actuality of this
                    law of establishment.</p>
            <p>Six men, of whom Dr. Maxwell was one, were named as members of the board of trustees of the State
                    Seminary. He was made its presiding officer and occupied this position almost without intermission
                    throughout his life. Ur. Maxwell sought election to the Legislature solely that he might advance the
                    interests of the State Seminary.</p>
            <p>Let us glance for a moment at this pioneer as he again rode yonder to Corydon, this time an
                    accredited member of the House of Representatives from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName> to the sixth General Assembly. He was now thirty-five years of age, of slight build,
                    fair, straight, and stood six feet in his stockings. He was described by his friends as dignified in
                    bearing, easy in conversation, courteous and kindly in manner and liberal and judicial in his views,
                    but by his adversaries in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> who did not believe in "schoolin' " he was dubbed
                    "that______ aristocrat."</p>
            <p>One finds Dr. Maxwell at this sixth session of the Legislature serving on the ways and means
                    committee and on that of education. His constituents returned him as a member of the House of
                    Representatives to the eighth and ninth General Assemblies. At the eighth session he was elected
                    Speaker. On being conduct ed to the chair he thanked the members for the honor conferred upon him,
                    and enjoined the observance of good order and dc corum. At the close of the session a resolution was
                    unanimously passed that the unqualified approbation and thanks of the House are due the Hon David H.
                    Maxwell on account of [for the] intelligence, <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-008-3-007"/> assiduity and
                    impartiality displayed by him in the chair.</p>
            <p>During the years 1826-'29 he represented the counties of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Monroe</region>, <region type="county">Greene</region>
               </placeName> and Owen in the State
                    Senate, where as a member of the ways and means committee, and as chairman of the committee on
                    education he guarded jealously, at all times, the affairs of the new seminary. It was during the
                    latter part of his senatorial service, January 24, 1828, that "Indiana College"
                    was established. Dr. Woodburn, in his monograph on "Higher Education in Indiana,"
                    has said: "In the establishment of institutions it seems that the life and services of some
                    one man are paramount and essential. In the establishment of the Indiana Seminary, Dr. David H.
                    Maxwell was the essential man."</p>
            <p>The success with which internal improvement schemes were being prosecuted at this period in
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, gave a strong impetus to the feeling that something must be done in Indiana. The
                    Internal Improvement System, therefore, was adopted without objection, at the session of the
                    Legislature of 1835-'36. Governor Noble nominated Dr. Maxwell to the Senate, without any
                    knowledge or solicitation on his part, as a member of the State Board of Internal Improvements. Upon
                    the meeting and organization of the board he was unanimously elected its president. Heavy care and
                    responsibility devolved upon him in this capacity. Could the success of the undertaking only have
                    been commensurate with the amount of labor involved, it would indeed have been great.</p>
            <p>The State authorized an expenditure of more than $10,000,000 for the building of canals,
                    roads and railroads. The cost of the projects exceeded the estimates, the proceeds from the canal
                    lands did not meet expectations, the panic of 1837 made it impossible to borrow money. Governors
                    Noble, Wallace and Bigger respectively expressed sanguine hope in the outcome of the Internal
                    Improvement System, but the State had undertaken too heavy a burden, and it was a number of years
                    before it recovered from the effects of it.</p>
            <p>After the campaign of 1840, Dr. Maxwell, a Whig in politics, was appointed postmaster at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> by President Tyler, and served from May 31, 1841, until December 30, 1845. He was <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-008-3-008"/> superseded by John M. Berry, an appointee of James K. Polk.
                    With the return of the Whigs to power, Dr. Maxwell was again made postmaster. This time the
                    appointment came from Zachary Taylor. The term of office lasted from 1849 to 1852.</p>
            <p>Recollections of Dr. Maxwell in his home are very precious to his children, two of whom are living.
                    They recall the book shelves in the corner where the Bible, Burns, Shakespeare, Children of the
                    Abbey, books of Erasmus Darwin and works on government stood side by side. Also they recall the
                    winter evenings around the fire, when their mother knitted and their father read aloud to them his
                    favorite poems or plays. Nor do they forget his gun and his love for hunting. They remember the firm
                    but kind discipline of his Scotch-Irish training; the spirit with which he instilled in them the
                    love of learning; his errands of mercy to the sick, for he knew no rich nor poor; and his fidelity
                    to the church and its institutions.</p>
            <p>One gathers from the writings of that day that Dr. Maxwell as a citizen and public servant commanded
                    the respect of his compeers; that his wise sympathy arid medical skill made him a beloved physician,
                    and that he defended loyally and disinterestedly the cause of Indians University from 1820 to 1854.
                    He was a friend of Indiana University from its inception. It was through his initiative, influence
                    and efforts that the law of establishment was passed. For this reason he has been designated as its
                    founder, and in recognition of the joint services of himself and son, the late Ur. James Darwin
                    Maxwell, one of the university buildings bears their name, "Maxwell Hall."</p>
            <p>Such is the chronicle of Dr. Maxwell's life, whose years did not reach three score and ten.
                    With the words on his lips, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,"
                    he died May 24, 1854.</p>

            <head>INDIANA GEOGRAPHICAL NOMENCLATURE.</head>
            <byline>JACOB PIATT DUNN</byline>
            <p>WHEN I was preparing my "True Indian Stories," I made a special study of all
                    Indiana geographical names supposed to be of Indian origin, and found most of them much corrupted
                    and commonly misunderstood. The only possible way to get at their real form and meaning was to go to
                    the Indians for the Indian names. In the interest of accurate information, I offer the following
                    corrections of the origin of some of the Indiana names, given by Gannett, and published in your last
                    number:</p>
            <p>Amo: The word for "honey-bee" in the Ojibwa and Potawatomi languages is, ah-mo. The
                    Miami form of the word is ah-mah-wi-ah (literally "the gatherer"). It is
                    historically certain that the name of our Indiana town did not come from this source. It was laid
                    out in 1850 by Joseph Morris, and was originally called Morrisville. Half a dozen years later it had
                    been made a postoffice; and Isaac Larrance was postmaster. In those days there were no rubber stamps
                    or dating machines, and the postmaster had to write the name of the postoffice and date of mailing
                    on each piece of mail. Larrance decided that a shorter name would be an improvement; and his
                    daughter, who was studying Latin, suggested Amo ("I love") as both short and
                    sweet. Larrance recommended the change to the department, and it was adopted.</p>
            <p>Calumet: This is a corruption of the Indian name of the stream, which appears on old maps as
                    Cal-la-mick, Kil-la-mick, Ken-no-mick, Ken-nou-mic, or, in the locative form, Ken-no-mo-konk. All of
                    these are dialect variations of the same word, used by the several Algonquian tribes who have, or
                    lack, the sound of "l" in their languages. The name varies from Ge-kel-e-muk in
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware Lo Ken-nom-kyah</region>
                    </placeName> in the Potawatomi, but in all cases it means a long body of deep, still water.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess</region>
                    </placeName>: The gallant colonel's name was Daveiss, and he always wrote it that way. We
                    have inverted the "e" and 'i," and altered the pronunciation.</p>
            <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-008-3-010"/>
            <p>Dishmaugh: The idea that this name means "Lake of the Monks" is due to a false
                    assumption that the French called it Lac des Moines. The lake is at the head of Trail creek, which
                    the French called Riviere du Chemin; and they called the lake Lac du Chemin. Dishmaugh is an
                    American corruption of du chemin. The American public usually make wild work of
                    "chemin." For example, the "Smackover river," in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, is the popular reproduction of chemin couvert, or "covered road."
                    Both the French and American names of our creek are translations of the Potawatomi name,
                    Me-eh-way-se-be-weh, and the name was given because the old Potawatomi trail from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Niles</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, ran along Trail creek to its source.</p>
            <p>
               <geogName>Eel River</geogName>: There are two Eel rivers in Indiana. The Miami name of the one that
                    empties into the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> is Ke-na-pe-kwo-nia-kwah, which is their word for eel—literally
                    "snake-fish." In Chamberlain's Gazetteer (1850) the name of this stream
                    is given as Sho-a-niaque, but this is probably a confusion with the Eel river that is tributary to
                    White river. This was in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> country, and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> word for "eel" is schach-a-niack, or "slippery
                    fish." The Indian names on Hough's map, in the Indiana Geological Report for 1882,
                    are fairly accurate, but the appended notes by Judge Beckwith are chiefly absurd attempts to
                    construct Miami words from Ojibwa stems.</p>
            <p>Indiana: The name was originally constructed to designate a tract of land in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> ceded by the Indians at the treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768; and still exists at the
                    place of its origin in the name of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Indiana county</region>
                    </placeName>. It was merely transferred to our State.</p>
            <p>Iroquois: There have been various surmises as to this name, but the Iroquois authorities of the
                    Bureau of Ethnology have. settled on its derivation from, meaning "real adders" or
                    serpents. (Hand-book of American Indians, title Iroquois.)</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Neither the translation "young grandmother," not those of
                    "black walnut" and "bear chief," which have also been. given for
                    the word, have any foundation in fact. It is a Miami name, and the Miami for "young
                    grandmother" is Kwe-sa-ko-ko- <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-008-3-011"/> men. There is no Miami
                    word approximating <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName> as we pronounce it, but if you put the accent on the middle syllable, make the first
                    "o") long, as in "cold," and the second and third
                    "o"s short, as in "hot," you have the original; for the Indians
                    say it was named for a Thorntown Miami whose name was "Ko-kahmah." His name
                    appears in the treaty at the Forks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1834, as "Co-come-wah." The name may be translated "the
                    diver," i. e., something animate that goes under the water.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>: It is stated that Captain Logan was the son of a sister of Tecumthe. He was a Shawnee
                    boy who was captured in the expedition against the towns on Mad river, in 1786, and was adopted and
                    brought up by General Logan of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, whose name he took. He was a faithful friend of the whites, and lost his life in their
                    service in 1812. His Indian name—written variously from Spamagelabe to Spemica
                    Lawba—means "the high horn."</p>
            <p>Metea: Our town was named for the Potawatomi chief Me-te-ah ("kiss me"), whom
                    McCoy, in his History of Baptist Missions, calls "Meteor." His village, on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>, some nine miles above <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Ft. Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, at the mouth of Cedar creek, was called Mus-kwah-wah-se-pe-o-tan, or Cedar Creek Town.</p>
            <p>Miami: This is the French form of the name of our principal Indian tribe, and as pronounced in
                    French—me-ah-me—is the proper Indian name. We have adopted the French
                    spelling, but Anglicized the pronunciation to My-am-my. Maumee is an attempt at the reproduction of
                    the same word in English orthography. The name is certainly not the Miami for
                    "mother" (ningi-ah, my mother; ki-ki-ah, your mother) nor their word for the wild
                    pigeon, which is me-me-ah. The Miamis themselves cannot give any meaning for it, which is pretty
                    conclusive evidence that it is not from their language. The earliest French explorers and
                    missionaries wrote the name Oumiamiak, varied to Miamiaouek, Miamiak, etc. The first syllable
                    "ou" is one of the uncertainties in pioneer French orthography. It may represent
                    the sound of "oo" in "boot," or of "o" in
                    "cold," or of "w," which is not included in the French alphabet.
                    The last use is very common, as, <pb n="112" id="VAA4025-008-3-012"/> for example, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ouabache</settlement>
                    </placeName> (<placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Miamiouek</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The name is most probably the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> We-mi-a-mik, by which the Miamis are designated in the Walum Olum. It means literally
                    "all beavers," figuratively "all friends"; and very accurately
                    expresses the relations of the Miamis to the Delawares.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName>: This is the Potawatomi m'sheh-wah-keek, a contraction of
                    m'sheh-wah-kee-ki, which means "country of dead trees." The Indians say
                    there was at this place a tract of dead timber, probably caused by fire, which gave rise to the
                    name.</p>
            <p>Mississinewa: This is plainly a corruption of the Miami name of the stream, which is
                    Na-mah-chis-sin-wi. This means literally "it slants," or as the Indians say, it
                    means "much fall in the river."</p>
            <p>Modoc: This name is said by the best authorities to have been given this tribe by the hostile tribe
                    of Shasteecas; and means "enemies."</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>: This is the name of the Wolf clan of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> nation, written variously Munsee, Monsey, Monthee, etc., but more properly Min-si or
                    Min-thi-u. It means "people of the stony country"—they lived back from
                    the coast, in the mountains. They did not come to Indiana permanently until about 1750. The name of
                    their town, at the site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which is written variously, from Wa-pi-ka-mi-kunk to Wa-pi-com-i-koke, means
                        <geogName>White River</geogName> Town. Some local histories say the original town was a little
                    higher up the river, and that it was called "Ou-tain-ink." This arises from a
                    misunderstanding of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> word u-ten-ink, which means site of the town, or place where the town was.</p>
            <p>Muscatatuck: There is no excuse for this spelling, which was not used while the Delawares were in the
                    State, as is seen in the following: "Muscacketuck," Laws of 1815, p. 4;
                    "Muscacketuck," John Melish's map, 1817; "Muskakituck,"
                    Tanner's American Atlas, 1819; "Muscackituck," Laws of 1820, p. 51;
                    "Muscakituck," Laws of 1821, p. 68. In his Gazetteer, Chamberlain, who makcs it
                    Muscackituck at p. 329, and Muscakituk at pages 208 and 215, says: "In Indian
                    Mesh-caque-tuck, or Pond river, from many <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-008-3-013"/> stagnant places in
                    low water." There is nothing in the word to indicate this meaning. Indeed, the opposite is
                    implied in the ending "hit-tuk," which is applied to small rivers, or large
                    creeks, and usually to rapid ones. There are no ponds or stagnant pools in the Muscackituck
                    now,—much less before the forests were cut off. The name is <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, compounded of "mosch-ach-gcu," which means
                    "clear," "not turbid," and "hit-tuk," i. e.,
                    Mosch-ach-hit-tuk (ch as in German) or Clear river.</p>
            <p>Redwood: Algonquian words that mean literally "red wood" all refer to cedar trees.
                    The Miami word for what we call the red-bud, or Judas tree, is i-on-za-wi-kish.</p>
            <p>

                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>: The Potawatomi name of this stream is Ke-tap-e-kon, and the Miami name Ke-tap-kwa-na,
                    both of which are the names of the buffalo fish, which was always plentiful in the stream. Our word, "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>," is corruption of the name of the town at its mouth, which was
                    Ke-tap-e-kon-nong, or as usually written by Americans Keth-tip-pe-can-nunk, i. e., the terminal
                    locative added to the name of the stream. "Canoe" is not a word of any Indian
                    tribe in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">North America</region>

               <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vermillion</region>
                    </placeName>: The county (properly <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vermillion</region>
                    </placeName>, because it was so named by the law creating it) was named from the tributary of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> at that point, which the French called "Vermillon Jaune," i. e.,
                    red-yellow. Colonel Croghan says in his journal that the stream was "so called from a fine
                    red earth found there by the Indians, with which they paint themselves." On
                    Hough's map the Indian name is given as "O-san-a-mon." This is the old
                    Algonquian word for vermilion paint, which Schoolcraft derives from o-sa-wa,
                    "yellow," and u-ni-mun, the name of a plant from which the Indians made a red dye.
                    (Memoirs, p. 158.) The French name is an exact translation of this, and a very good description of
                    the color.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>: This is plainly an abbreviated corruption of the Miami name of the stream, which is
                    Wah-bah-shik-ki (or Wahpah-shik-ki, the sounds of "b" and "p"
                    being convertible in the Miami, as in most of the Algonquian languages). The stem wahbah means
                    "white," and the declensional ending, shik-ki, implies <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-008-3-014"/> that the object qualified is pure or bright in color, inanimate, and
                    natural—as distinguished from artificial. It could not be applied, for example, to paper,
                    or cloth, the proper form for them being wah-pah-kin-gi. But it is applied properly to white stones,
                    shells, etc., and the name was given to the river on acount of the limestone bed in its upper part.
                    The delusion that it means "a cloud driven forward by an equinoctial wind" arose
                    from mistaking an illustration for a definition. Somebody has asked an Indian for the meaning of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and he, looking about for something inanimate, natural, and pure white, has pointed to
                    a cloud, and said: "That's wabash." It was in the spring or fall, and the
                    wind was blowing, so the seeker for information put on the poetry "a cloud driven forward
                    by the equinoctial wind," and entirely missed the Indian's meaning. I was once
                    discussing the word with some Miamis, when old She-kwi-ah (William Godfroy) picked up a flat piece
                    of limestone, pointed to a fossil shell which stood out clear white against the gray of the stone,
                    and said: "That's wah-pah-shik-ki." If I had not been on my guard I might
                    have recorded that, "wah-pah-shik-ki is a fossil shell, of the genus spirifer, imbedded in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Niagara</settlement>
                    </placeName> limestone"; but all that he meant was that it was pure white, inanimate and
                    natural.</p>
            <p>
               <geogName>White River</geogName>: The Miami name of the stream is Wah-pi-ka-me-ki, or White Waters.
                    The Delawares at first used the same name (varied to O-pe-ka-me-ki in the Unami dialect), but later
                    used Wah-pi-han-ni, or White river. The French name Riviere Blanche is an exact translation of this.</p>
            <p>Winamac: This word, written variously "We-ne-mec," "We-na-meck,"
                    "Win-ni-meg," "Wi-ne-mack," "Wy-ne-mac," etc.,
                    is the Potawatomi name of the catfish, compounded of wee-nud, meaning "turbid," or
                    "muddy," and mak, "a fish." It is used quite commonly by the
                    Potawatomis as a personal name, and the person for whom our town is named was a Potawatomi chief who
                    was rather prominent in 1812. and who died in 1821. A sketch of him will be found in
                    Thatcher's "Indian Biographies," p. 214.</p>

            <head>THE BATTLE OF FORT HARRISON.</head>
            <p>The centennial anniversary of the battle of Fort Harrison was celebrated on an ambitious scale by
                    Terre Haute on September 2, 3 and 4, one feature of the preliminaries being the publication of a
                    handsome souvenir of seventy-two pages, to which a number of writers contribute, and which contains
                    about all the history that can be gathered relative to this old military post. There are many items
                    of information in these pages that evidently have been unearthed from obscure sources.</p>
            <p>The Terre Haute Star of September 5 reports at length the culmination of the celebration on the 4th,
                    and from this report we quote:</p>
            <p>"With ceremony befitting the occasion, the rough hewn granite monument marking the site of
                    old Fort Harrison was unveiled yesterday afternoon and the stars and stripes were hoisted above the
                    column by William Henry Harrison, the great-great-grandson of the illustrious builder of the
                    historic old fortress. The unveiling ceremony was supplemented by a dignified celebration
                    commemorating the battle of Fort Harrison, in which both members of the Sons and Daughters of the
                    American Revolution and Masons partioipated.</p>
            <p>"On the banks of the historic <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> river last night the battle of Fort Harrison was fought over again for the educational
                    value to the younger generation of Americans. Fort Harrison in miniature, perched on a slight
                    eminence on the west bank of the river, was stormed by scores of red men, representing the Indians
                    under Chief Lenar, and just when the fight raged fiercest, when things looked hopeless for the
                    little garrison of frontiersmen, help came and the fort was saved. The fierce attack of the rescue
                    party—Company B, Indiana National Guard, under command of Captain Benjamin
                    Wimer—followed by the most elaborate fireworks display ever shown in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, made an excellent climax to the three days' centennial celebration.</p>
            <p>"Promptly at the time set for the crowning event of the centennial <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-008-3-016"/> the pyrotechnical display began. The first number—a set
                    piece—blazed forth, giving a beautiful likeness of old Fort Harrison in red, which turned
                    into a brilliant white. Then came an extra display furnished by the flotilla of motorboats, under
                    command of Commodore Ed Tetzel, Jr.</p>
            <p>"Before executing the attack on the fort the Indians, headed by Chief George T. Smith,
                    gathered the tribes for a war dance on the river bank south of the fort. Clad in full Indian garb,
                    the aborigines then made their midnight sally, which ended in defeat.</p>
            <p>"It is estimated that between thirty thousand and forty thousand people witnessed the
                    event."</p>
            <p>Dr. W. W. Parsons was the president of the day, and among the speakers were the Hon. Charles W.
                    Fairbanks and Judge Charles J. Orbison, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Editorial Note—J. H. B. Nowland, in his "Sketches of Prominent Citizens"
                    (p. 10), speaking of the White river ford at the mouth of Fall creek, makes this statement:</p>
            <p>"It was here that Lieutenant Taylor (afterward President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>) crossed his army when marching from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, to build
                    Fort Harrison, in the year 1811. This fact the writer learned from him personally." He also
                    says that "While the army was here, the late Colonel Abel C. Pepper said he first met the
                    celebrated Shawnee chief, Tecumseh, who was here on an embassy to the Delawares."</p>
            <p>There was more of this story as the present writer received it from Mr. Nowland, writing it down at
                    the time. The substance of it was that when Taylor and his men reached the ford he found four or
                    five hundred Delawares camped there preparatory to a council to be held with Tecumseh that evening.
                    William Conner, the well-known Indian trader, and an influential man among the Delawares, was with
                    them. He advised Taylor to put the creek between his camp and the Indians. That evening Tecumseh in
                    his address appealed to the passions of his hearers till they arose in frenzy, drawing and
                    flourishing their tomahawks. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> chief, Anderson, and Conner at once counteracted the effect of Tecumseh's
                    speech, Conner accusing the agitator of purely mercenary motives, and of being employed by the
                    British for <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-008-3-017"/> such purposes. In the end only two of the chiefs
                    were disposed to ally themselves with Tecumseh. The authorities for this story, Mr. Nowland
                    affirmed, were General Taylor, Colonel Pepper, John Tipton and William Conner.</p>
            <p>Mr. Nowland was a conscientious chronicler and there must have been some foundation for his
                    statement, but certain discrepancies necessarily modify it. Lieutenant Taylor could not have been on
                    his way "to build Fort Harrison," as it was built by Harrison's force in
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> campaign, and when Tecumseh was in the south. If the Shawnee chief was acting as an
                    emissary of the British, it must have been in relation to our war with that country, which would
                    shift the date to 1812 instead of 1811. We have nowhere seen any account as to just how or when
                    Lieutenant Taylor went to Fort Harrison. It would seem not improbable that on his way to garrison
                    that point, marching from the falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, his route may have been by the way of the White river ford at Fall creek, and that the
                    incident narrated by Nowland may have occurred some time between June and September of 1812.</p>
            <p rend="center">AT BETHLEHEM.</p>
            <p>On the 15th of June last the little town of <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Clark county</region>
                    </placeName>, celebrated its centennial anniversary with a crowd of nearly one thousand persons in
                    attendance. A historical paper written by Mrs. Elinor Halley Campbell and read by John S. Pernett,
                    contained local data of interest.</p>
            <p>The ground on which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bethlehem</settlement>
                    </placeName> stands was owned at the time of platting (1812) by Jonathan Clark, Colonel John
                    Armstrong and others. Colonel Armstrong was born in the town of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Bethlehem</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>,
                    and the new town was, it is surmised, named in honor of his birthplace. The surveyor of the town was
                    W. C. Greenup. One of the first purchasers was Bailey Johnston, who paid $10 for a
                    centrally located lot. Some of the other purchasers were Olmstead, Belden, Sturdivant, Marton,

            <p>"August 1st, 1912, marked the one-hundredth aniversary of the first services held in the

                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>

                    </placeName>, made the principal address. Other addresses were made by local people and were of a
                    reminiscent nature. This date, August 1, was not that of the dedication of the church, but marked
                    the first services held in the meeting house.</p>
            <p>"The first minutes of the congregation hear date of October 5, 1806. Unfortunately, the
                    first few pages of the book are missing. These pioneer people had many hardships in building. The
                    clay for the bricks was tramped by oxen, work had to be suspended to build a blockhouse, to protect
                    the people from the Indians, and finally a long delay was caused on account of not being able to
                    procure nails.</p>

                    </placeName> Historical Society, and it is their endeavor to restore and keep this old church, as it
                    marked the beginning of religious life in the White Water valley."</p>
            <p>Editorial Note—This old building is an interesting relic of pioneer days. We remember it
                    as it stood some years ago—a substantial brick structure with an interior arrangement now
                    quite obsolete. a central space being partially surrounded by the seats, with an ample gallery
                    above. The little pulpit stood high up on one side and was lighted by a small window. A traditional
                    anecdote survives to the effect that the preacher on one occasion, glancing out of the window into
                    the graveyard, saw a man actively searching for a bumble bee that was up his pantaloon leg. The
                    result was an irrelevant and seemingly irreverent snort of mirth interjected into the sermon, to the
                    great scandal of his pious hearers, who had no inkling as to the cause.</p>

            <head>THE GRAVE OF LITTLE TURTLE</head>
            <p>THE grave of Little Turtle, the noted Miami chief, has long been lost to knowledge, but it is thought
                    that it has at last been found and identified beyond all doubt. The chieftain was buried somewhere
                    on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> site in July, 1812, his death having occurred July 14, and the finding of the grave was
                    within a few days of being an exact century. Mr. J. M. Stouder, to whom belongs the credit of
                    identifying the grave, published the following account in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> Journal-Gazette of August 4. By letter Mr. Stouder informs us that the spot he
                    describes was, perhaps, the last cemetery of the Miamis at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, and that more than twenty-five bodies have been exhumed in that locality. The skull
                    found with the identifying relics has been sent to the Smithsonian Institute for examination, and on
                    its return will be returned to the grave, and steps will be taken toward erecting a fitting monument
                    to the memory of the chief.</p>

            <p>July 4, 1912, will hereafter be memorable to the citizens of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen county</region>
                    </placeName>. On that day Albert and Charles Loch-ner uncovered the grave of Little Turtle, the
                    great Miami war chief.</p>
            <p>The brothers had contracted to build a house for Dr. George W. Gillie on Lawton place, and in digging
                    the cellar uncovered several Indian graves. Noticing that whatever was in the graves was
                    appropriated by the laborers, the contractors called off the crew and with the assistance of Dr.
                    George W. Gillie dug the drain in which the grave of Little Turtle was found.</p>
            <p>The finders had no idea of the identity of the body. The skull was carefully kept and presented to
                    Dr. M. W. Ivins, dentist at 1118 Rivermet avenue, who had requested the Lochner brothers to save a
                    good specimen for him. The balance of the remains were scattered and carried away by the curious as
                    mementos.</p>
            <p>Around the neck of the chief was found the string of silver beads and crosses and in the few
                    remaining tufts of hair on the <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-008-3-020"/> back of the skull was the string
                    of white shell beads. The hair was also tied with a buckskin thong, and, from the description given
                    by the Lochner brothers was well preserved. The vermillion war paint was beneath the
                    chieftain's knees, the solid silver armlets on his arms, the anklet and the famous sword,
                    the gun and the remnant of the pistol were at his side. The various other implements had been placed
                    in various other parts of the grave and had probably become disarranged in the digging of the drain.
                    On the breast were the silver discs, believed to be medals. These were fastened together by means of
                    a buckskin thong and are shown in the collection just as they were found.</p>
            <p>About a month ago I had occasion to visit the home of Albert Lochner and asked to see the Indian
                    relics that I knew he had in his possession, as I am always interested in such discoveries. I was
                    immediately struck by the apparent wealth and importance of the find and began an investigation as
                    to the identity of the person in the grave. Early in my research work I became convinced that Albert
                    and Charles Lochner and Dr. Gillie had discovered the grave of Little Turtle. I am greatly indebted
                    to Miss Eliza Rudisill, Mr. Howard Hanthorn and Mr. Charles H. Worden for the assistance they have
                    given me in identifying the grave of the greatest chief of his time.</p>
            <p>Articles taken from the grave are: Eight silver bracelets, two silver anklets, one heavy metal
                    bracelet, three silver medals, on the inside of one of which is a small remnant of canvas; four
                    silver brooches, one pair of silver earrings and six pendants, one string of silver beads,
                    twenty-three silver crosses, each one inch in length; four silver crosses, each six inches long; one
                    sword, with silver hilt, wrapped with gold braid, which we are certain is that presented to the
                    chief by General George Washington; one string of white shell beads, four metal buttons, one small
                    pocket knife, one large clasp knife of very old design, one drinking cup, one metal spoon, one pair
                    of shears, one hammer, one gun barrel, from which rotted portions of the stock fell when it was
                    lifted from the grave; one pair of bullet moulds, one flint lock, the only remains of a pistol; two
                    flints for gun and pistol, three large knives, one pair of steel spurs, one ax, one tomahawk, one
                    copper <pb n="121" id="VAA4025-008-3-021"/> kettle, containing when found beans and corn which went
                    to a fine powder when exposed to the air, and the skull of the great red leader.</p>
            <p>That within so comparatively short a period of time as a hundred years the grave of this illustrious
                    man should have been forgotten seems strange, and now that the grave has been found the spot should
                    be appropriately marked by the patriotic people of Indiana.</p>
            <p>I have been asked how I know so positively that this is the grave of Little Turtle. Bryce, in his
                    History of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, says that Little Turtle was buried with the sword presented him by General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the medal given him at the treaty of Greenville. I have them both, together with
                    all of his weapons and ornaments.</p>
            <p>Jacob Piatt Dunn, secretary of the Indiana Historical Society, says that Little Turtle was buried on
                    the bank of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>'s river and when the interment was made it was considerably north of what was
                    then <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The final proof came to me Thursday evening. W. D. Schiefer, of the Schiefer shoe store, volunteered
                    the information that while he resided on the old Barnett place in 1875 a man named Hedges, who had
                    been present at the burial of Little Turtle, had pointed out to him the exact location of the grave
                    as well as the old man could remember. Without any suggestions from me, and, although he had not
                    been in that locality since Spy Run was laid out, Mr. Schiefer took me to within one hundred feet of
                    the place where the grave was uncovered. From Mr. Schiefer I have the folowing statement:</p>
            <p rend="right">"<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, August 1, 1912.</p>
            <p>"I was personally acquainted with a pioneer resident of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen county</region>
                    </placeName> named Hedges, who was present at the burial of Little Turtle, and while living on the
                    Barnett place in 1875, Mr. Hedges visited me and pointed out to me as near as he could recollect the
                    place where Little Turtle's body had been interred on the edge of the farm along the river.</p>

            <p rend="center">THE INDIANAPOLIS TRAINING SCHOOL.</p>
            <p>When the work of re-establishing a public school system, that can scarcely be said to have had more
                    than a fair beginning, was undertaken in the years 1863–4–5, many questions of
                    importance were up for settlement. The one providing more commodious school buildings, with improved
                    warming and ventilating facilities such as would contribute more fully to the health and comfort of
                    the children, was of vital importance. Along with this was always present in the minds of the school
                    authorities the question of providing more capable and well qualified teachers. Money was scarce,
                    the salaries were low, good teachers could not be brought from other cities and towns for the
                    compensation we could afford them. Most of the teachers already in the schools were of excellent
                    character and ability, always ready for a faithful discharge of duty, but probably no one of them
                    had ever received any special normal school training. How to provide a continuous supply to take the
                    places made vacant by resignations and to fill new positions opened up by the increased attendance
                    of children was the question to be satisfactorily settled.</p>
            <p>Meantime I had visited a number of the cities of the West and had noted carefully the work that was
                    being done in their so-called normal schools, but to me all was unsatisfactory. The nature of the
                    instruction was very much such as we were already <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-008-3-023"/> giving in our
                    newly organized high school, and therefore was not of a character to suit my needs; there was in
                    them too little of the theory, almost nothing in the practice that would give to the learner clearly
                    defined ideas of school organization, management and instruction. And then, for settlement, was the
                    question as to what we had better do.</p>
            <p>The answer to all this was given in the establishment of an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> school for the training of teachers. This was undertaken early in the year 1867, and
                    the school was got under way on the 1st of March of that year. Amanda P. Funnele, a woman of large
                    ability and rare accomplishment, was found to take the principalship of the school. Miss Funnele was
                    a graduate and for a time a teacher in the Oswego Normal School, and at the time of her engagement
                    to come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a teacher in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> Normal School, at that time one of the foremost schools of its kind in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. From its organization to the close of the school year, in 1874, there had been three
                    principals—Miss Funnele, Miss Clara Armstrong and Miss Florinda Williams.</p>
            <p>The new school, it might be said, was an experiment. No school exactly of its kind could be found
                    anywhere, and for this reason some doubts existed as to its success. But in the minds of those who
                    had thought it over and over so many times there was very little or none of this. The plan of
                    organization for the school was a simple one and to put it into execution was not at all difficult.
                    To carry out this design the school was organized on the plan of an equal division of time between
                    the theory and the practice of teaching. It had therefore two departments, the one of instruction,
                    the other of practice.</p>
            <p>Twelve young women of good education and apparently possessing the characteristics that one would
                    like in a good teacher were chosen to form the first class of pupil-teachers. Six rooms in the newly
                    constructed building at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Blackford</region>
                    </placeName> streets were set apart for the use of the school. The children, about three hundred in
                    number, were to be taught by the pupil-teachers and formed the material on which the young teacher
                    would be taught her first lessons in the practical side of her new occupation. <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-008-3-024"/> Six of the pupil-teachers were in charge of the schools of practice,
                    while the other section of the same number was in another part of the building receiving
                    instructions from the principal. The section of teachers in charge of the school of practice were
                    expected to conduct the exercises, recitations, etc., and proceed as though they were regular
                    teachers receiving the maximum salaries.</p>
            <p>Of the nine hundred and ninety young women who have already completed the training school course of
                    study, practically all have been employed in the schools, and it is safe to say nine hundred were
                    residents of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and it may also be said that three-fourths of them would never have taught a day in
                    this city but for this special training. This, of course, satisfied an oft-repeated demand that
                    people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> should be allowed to teach their own children, which was the opinion of many good
                    citizens. To be sure there is some ground for this belief, for there was at that time, and are now,
                    hundreds of young men and women who have the education if they had received the additional training.
                    All told there have been a few less than a thousand young women who have completed the course in
                    training afforded and have entered the schools as teachers and were fitted to do a large share of
                    the best work done in the schools. Last year there were 320 of them in the schools, of which twelve
                    are in the list of supervising principals, eight are directors of practice, six are German teachers
                    and three are high school teachers. What was quite as important, they earned and spent their money
                    in and about their own homes and thereby brought help in a thousand ways to dependent children, and
                    often helpless fathers and mothers.</p>
            <p>It is not putting it too strongly to say that this quiet school, so seldom mentioned in the
                    newspapers and about which so little is known by the public, has brought more good than any other
                    single agency, and for more than forty years has formed the great right arm of the school system.
                    But for its influence and that of two or three other helpful agencies, of which I shall speak
                    hereafter, the school system of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> would have been very <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-008-3-025"/> much like the schools in any
                    one of a thousand other cities—and no better.</p>
            <p>As soon as results could be seen in this city, schools of a similar character were started in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, in this State. A committee from the first named city visited <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to inspect its training school. The Rev. Dr. Mayo, a distinguished Unitarian clergyman
                    of the committee, in an address to the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, teachers, said:</p>
            <p>"Last Monday it was my privilege to spend half a day in the examination of what is doubtless
                    the most complete training school in the Western States. In the upper room of a well-constructed
                    schoolhouse I found a quiet, self-possessed young woman standing before a group of half a dozen
                    girls in familiar conversation on their forenoon's work as teachers of the five hundred
                    children in the rooms below. Their conversation ranged through the whole realm of the life of
                    childhood, striving to analyze its faculties, comprehend its wants and get into perfect sympathy
                    with its mysterious inward life. Each of the girls told her experience with her class as earnestly
                    as if she knelt at the confessional, under the eye of a criticism as decided as it was sympathetic
                    and kind. Below I saw the working half of the class of pupil-teachers conducting the various
                    exercises of instruction. Through these rooms moved three critic teachers, noting everything,
                    advising, preparing to report in due time to the quiet little lady above. In one room a charming
                    model school was permanently kept by an experienced young woman. One man, with the title of
                    superintendent, was responsible for the order of the little community, and assisted in the teaching
                    of the older classes. I looked with delight too deep for expression on the beautiful spectacle of a
                    school where five hundred children are taught by these twenty girls, who themselves are learning the
                    finest art of modern life. I marked the deep enthusiasm, the blended firmness, self-possession and
                    gentleness, the sweet spirit of co-operation with which they went about their-duty. I saw in their
                    faces that they felt they had chosen the better part, were living for a purpose, and not troubled
                    overmuch about their position in American society."</p>

            <p>The question of proper provision for educating colored children in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been urged by men and women many times and in various ways. The average lawmakers
                    are afraid of certain questions, such as the tramp nuisance or the Gypsy business, kindred evils and
                    practices which have no right to exist in a civilized country. The question of woman's
                    suffrage never gets a fair hearing. A way can always be found either in caucus or committee to
                    smother it. It was exactly this way for many years with the question of negro education.</p>
            <p>The lawmaker who came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> every two years and promised to do great things for the betterment of conditions
                    throughout the State, could be induced to agree to almost anything; but when it came to a show-down
                    by voting on a few questions, negro education among the number, he was not ready. Colored people
                    were all about us and were rapidly increasing in numbers. More than three hundred years ago, when
                    forcibly brought to the American continent, they early embraced the theory about which we hear so
                    much of late, that it is their duty to multiply and replenish the earth. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> there were hundreds of adult American citizens and there were many hundreds of
                    children, nearly all of whom were illiterate and many of them vicious, and under these conditions a
                    menace to our civilization. Were they the less so because covered with a black skin? If they were a
                    menace, what was our plain duty?</p>
            <p>Fifty years ago the Indiana State Teachers' Association, then and ever since a mighty
                    educational power in the State, began the agitation for colored schools. In ten or twelve years
                    there were signs of approaching success. In 1867 an attempt was made to secure the needed
                    legislation but without avail. An effort was renewed at the opening session of 1869. An amendment to
                    the law was offered and favorable action was taken in the committees and in due time was passed by
                    the Senate. Action at the other end of the capitol was more dilatory. The amendment was hung up till
                    11:30 the last night of the last session and the chairman of the committee said: "It is now
                    or never." A half dozen persons began the work of getting the members from the cloakroom
                    and <pb n="127" id="VAA4025-008-3-027"/> lobbies into their seats. I remember that the late
                    Professor Bell, Thomas J. Vater and a number of other patriotic and humane men did all that was
                    posible for them to do. But the amendment failed for want of a constitutional
                    majority—fifty-one. Forty-six of the requisite number to pass it were present and voted
                    for it. But while that was a majority of all present, it was not enough to pass the measure. But
                    this was the last night of the session and any one who has been present on these occasions knows how
                    things are done. A truthful description of what took place on this particular night would not look
                    well in a newspaper.</p>
            <p>So it looked at the moment as if the black children were doomed to run the streets for another term
                    of two years while their fathers and mothers continued to pay their taxes, by the aid of which the
                    children of the more favored race were kept in school ten months of the year. For some reason, I do
                    not remember what, the Governor found it necessary to call an extra session of the Legislature, and
                    it was at this called session, May 13, 1869, that the amendment to the law admitting colored
                    children to public school privilege was passed. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> preparations for the accommodation of this large addition we were soon to have were
                    begun; some of the buildings already abandoned were repaired and refurnished; others were rented,
                    properly seated and made quite comfortable. By the first of September we were ready for all who
                    might apply.</p>
            <p>Meantime a constant search was kept up for competent colored men and women who could do the teaching.
                    The plan was to use colored teachers when they could be found, and white ones when they could not.
                    During the summer months, Sunday afternoon meetings were held in some of the colored churches, where
                    needful information was given to parents and guardians as to what would be expected of them when
                    their children were to enter school. These meetings were largely attended, and with much enthusiasm
                    in view of what was soon to occur. When the day came the buildings were crowded early with a herd of
                    rowdy and undisciplined blacks, and with a strong teaching force in number about equally divided
                    between the two races. Order was at once restored, and the work of classifying and grading was
                    begun. Five <pb n="128" id="VAA4025-008-3-028"/> years after they were first admitted to the schools
                    there were in attendance at both day and night schools over eight hundred colored pupils.</p>
            <p>The manner in which the colored children first gained admission to the high school without the
                    authority of law, I think, has never been correctly told. I can easily tell how it occurred. Two or
                    three years after the law of 1869, providing for the education of colored children, was enacted, a
                    few of them had mastered the course of study in the district schools and were prepared to enter the
                    high school. The law, however, provided for their education in separate schools and a high school
                    for a half dozen children was not to be thought of.</p>
            <p>There were up then for settlement some difficult questions. Early in the vacation of 1872, I think it
                    was, a committee of colored men, headed by the Rev. Moses Broyles, a prudent man and a good
                    preacher, came to me to ask what they were to do. Of course, I could not tell them what to do, as
                    the law was clearly against them. The committee was of the opinion that the constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> ought to admit them, and if it did not, the constitution of the State of Indiana
                    certainly would, as it specifically provided for a system of common schools by the General Assembly
                    wherein tuition should be free and open to all.</p>
            <p>Some of the committee were in favor of bringing suit to compel the authorities to admit the children.
                    Here it occurred to me that we could get at the matter in a better way by placing the burden of
                    excluding them on the shoulders of those who wanted them kept out, and that we could thus avoid the
                    cost and delay to those who were in favor of admitting them. I said: "Get ready one of your
                    brightest children and send her to me on the first day of school." This they did.</p>
            <p>Early in the morning on the opening day of school Mary Alice Rann, a bright, well-dressed girl, came
                    to me and expressed a wish to enter the high school. Without asking any questions, I walked with her
                    to the room of the principal, George P. Brown, and without any explanation or request, I said:
                    "Mr. Brown, here is a girl that wishes to enter the high school," and then went
                    back to my work.</p>
            <pb n="129" id="VAA4025-008-3-029"/>
            <p>Mary was admitted and remained in the high school for four years, and at the end of that time
                    received her diploma. Colored children have been admitted to the school ever since without question,
                    now for more than thirty-five years.</p>
            <p>On Thursday following the admission of the girl to the high school J. J. Bingham, editor at that time
                    of the Daily Sentinel, and member of the Board of School Commissioners, and I were standing in the
                    high school hall, when there came and stood within a few feet of us the girl above referred to,
                    waiting to ask me some question, and Mr. Bingham, seeing her, said:</p>
            <p>"I understand you have a nigger in the high school."</p>
            <p>I could only say, "Probably so, and I suppose that is the girl."</p>
            <p>At this Mr. Bingham said, "I have a long communication in my pocket now in regard to
                    it."</p>
            <p>Then I said, "That is a good place for it; better let it stay in your pocket."</p>
            <p>The communication was never published and that was about the last I ever heard of it.</p>
            <p>There is abundant evidence as to the standing of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools when compared with the school system in other cities. This evidence comes to us
                    in various ways, a few of which I may mention. Of late years particularly there is a manifest desire
                    on the part of the ruling authorities of foreign countries to know what is being done in this
                    country, educationally. It is a common thing for the South American republics to send commissions to
                    this country for this purpose. A number of the European countries have done the same thing. On their
                    arrival, of course, they go at once to the seat of government, where they are told where to go and
                    what to do to find the information they desire. I am informed that they are always directed to
                    Indiana and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> when they wish to know of public school organization and methods of instruction. These
                    instructions, of course, came from the Commisioner of Education himself, who has known more of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for forty years past than any other person in the country who has not lived in this
                    State.</p>
            <p>A <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> newspaper some years ago asked one hundred of <pb n="130" id="VAA4025-008-3-030"/> the
                    best informed educators of the country to express an opinion as to the best system of schools to be
                    found in any American city. Of the whole number nineteen voted for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, twelve for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and twelve for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mass., and no other city received more than seven votes.</p>
            <p>Other evidence was seen in the columns of a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> magazine, the proprietors of which employed, as they supposed, a competent man for the
                    task and instructed him to visit twenty of the principal cities of the country to examine the
                    organization, management and instruction of schools and to report his observations to the magazine.
                    After the list of cities to be inspected was agreed upon, the task was undertaken and the
                    instructions followed as nearly as could be.</p>
            <p>What was written for the magazine I only know in a general way, as I have never read the article. I
                    have, however, had several interviews with the writer, in which he described to me very fully the
                    things that he had seen and heard while on his tour of observation. He gave me the details as to the
                    nature of the instruction he had seen in several of the cities he had visited, particularly in
                    primary schools, and compared this work with what he had seen in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He said that, taking everything into consideration, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools were in all particulars equal to any he had yet seen, and in her primary
                    schools, particularly, he had seen much that had no equal in any other city.</p>
            <p>There are a few things characteristic of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools that are not common to the schools in other cities. I can briefly state a few
                    of them: First, we have had here for more than forty years a thoroughly nonpartisan control. In no
                    case during that period have I ever heard a man's political views discussed when
                    considering his fitness to do the work of a trustee or school commissioner. The schools to this
                    extent have been free from political influence. Nor have I ever heard, when superintendents,
                    supervisors or teachers were to be employed, any questions asked as to their political or religious
                    convictions. The tests of their fitness to do the work required were always applied in another way.
                    It was made my duty for eleven years to examine all applicants for positions as teachers, and no
                    question was ever asked, the answer <pb n="131" id="VAA4025-008-3-031"/> to which was expected to
                    reveal the applicant's beliefs on either of these subjects.</p>
            <p>Another feature of ours not found in other schools of the country, unless in later years, is that of
                    the special and effective supervision and instruction of our primary schools. As early as 1866 it
                    was plainly seen that the primary schools, as to their instruction, were not getting what they ought
                    to have. To supply this want the trustees asked me to find, if possible, a suitable person to
                    undertake this work. After searching for a time I was compelled to report to the board that no
                    person with the desired training could be found. After some further delay and consideration of the
                    matter it was determined to send one of our own teachers to a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    borne by the school board. In pursuance of this plan, Miss Nebraska Cropsey, one of our most
                    promising young women, was asked to go to the Oswego Normal School, to begin a mastery of the course
                    of study in the lowest primary, and ascend from grade to grade as rapidly as possible, and return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> when called for. Meantime I had visited the Oswego school and arranged fully the
                    details of the instruction she was to receive.</p>
            <p>In due time Miss Cropsey returned and took up the work of supervising the instruction and general
                    management of our primary schools, and has remained in that position continuously until the present
                    time.</p>
            <p>That this action, taken at the time and in the manner in which it was, has been largely beneficial to
                    the schools of the city, no one questions. This supervisory work over the primary schools has been
                    for forty years supplemental to the work done in the training school for teachers, and the two
                    working in perfect harmony have brought to the schools of <placeName>

                    </placeName> what could not have been secured in any other way. I state it moderately when I say
                    that a half million dollars, in addition to sums already paid out, spread out over the salaries of
                    teachers for the last forty years would not have secured the same desirable ends.</p>

            <p>I have gone back in the memories of my friends and of my own to the days when there were no lights at
                    night except candles—and tallow candles at that—when there were no such things
                    as matches and every candle was lighted by blowing one's breath of life away over a red hot
                    coal held in the spindle-legged tongs; when the great fireplace was filled with logs of wood, making
                    the grandest fire in the world; when at night the glowing back stick was carefully covered in a
                    grave of ashes in order to furnish food for the morning fire and when, if unfortunately the
                    protecting ashes failed, one of the children was sent to the nearest neighbor for a shovel of coals
                    with which to start the fire for the morning's breakfast; when each household had its own
                    dairy at the door; when the gardens were rife with flowers and fruits and vegetables; when everybody
                    slept in nightcaps; when a rail fence inclosed the grounds of the county seminary; when the streets
                    were crooked and full of stumps and lined on each side with dog fennel—and the
                    alleys—ugh! growing jimson.</p>
            <p>Our neighbors were not always those that were nearest our home. Up <placeName>

                    </placeName> street, or off around the Circle, or across the commons or fields, our nimble feet flew
                    on the way to school as we went by to get the company of a friend or as we returned home, stopping
                    to take a schoolmate with us to stay all night. What evenings of fun spent in merry games! How we
                    gathered the spicy four-o'clocks into our aprons, and sat on the porch, and of them made
                    necklaces! How we cracked the capsules of the "touch-me-nots!" How we talked after
                    we went to bed! And with what joy we went hand in hand to school in the morning! Friendships were
                    then formed which the years have not tarnished nor broken.</p>
            <pb n="133" id="VAA4025-008-3-033"/>
            <p>Near my father's house, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> street, at the west end of where the Claypool Hotel now stands, lived for a short time
                    a young merchant from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He had brought to this frame house, hurriedly built on wooden piles, his bride and her
                    little sister. The child, only seven or eight years old, easily won the hearts of the neighbors by
                    her grace and beauty and gentle manners. One unfortunate day, while handling her sister's
                    scissors, she fell, and the cruel instrument pierced her knee, the point breaking off under the
                    joint. A doctor was sent for. He was on his farm felling trees and burning brush, doing this work at
                    odd times, when not practicing medicine. He hurried to the home of the little patient. His hands
                    were hard, his fingers unfit to touch the child's tender flesh. In those primitive times
                    there were no blessed anaesthetics, and consciously ‘the pain had to be borne. Under the
                    hand of the doctor she lay for hours, while he cut into the limb searching for the broken point;
                    finally, unwilling though he was, the only thing to be done was amputation. He attempted this, but
                    the hard hands could not catch or hold the artery, and death came to the relief of the sufferer. The
                    sister in her passion of grief fled to the woods nearby to lose sight of the dear child. The
                    neighbors gathered together in sympathy and love, and their kind hands carried the little body to
                    the graveyard by the river.</p>
            <p>The unsightly building in which the family lived stood for years, and more than one tragedy was
                    enacted within its walls. Here among the early pastors of the Presbyterian church came the Rev.
                    George Bush, a scholar, a gentleman and a Christian. Later years made him professor of Hebrew and
                    Oriental literature in the University of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, his bride, a fair girl, who had known nothing of the trials of frontier
                    life—the daughter of a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator. Think of setting up housekeeping in this barn of a house! No furniture or
                    carpet stores, no hardware or china supplies. A salary of $400, rarely fully paid. The
                    little that they had, brought from her own home through the unbroken forest in a wagon. The bright
                    girl wife soon gained the love of her neighhors. <pb n="134" id="VAA4025-008-3-034"/> and when she
                    lay dying before the year was out, a tender mother took the new-born babe to her breast, sharing
                    willingly her own baby's food with the motherless child, and when this kind
                    mother's strength failed, another was found who as equally loving and generous. From this
                    home was the stranger carried. through the narrow pathway bordered by tall iron-weed and buried
                    beneath the green grass and wild flowers near the river.</p>
            <p>A little love story belongs to a very early day; so little and simple it is like a humming
                    bird's nest in an umbrageous oak. They were but boy and girl. She was fair and sweet, a
                    dainty, delicate. laughing, singing, light-hearted, loving creature. He was a tall, slender,
                    graceful youth, fond of woods and waters, an active and daring hunter, of a droll and merry wit.
                    gifted in conversation, most winning and charming in all his ways. She was gifted in music and had
                    been trained to the piano almost from her infancy. He had a high spirit and refined tastes; he was,
                    in short, nature's gentleman, as she was a natural lady. He was an orphan and poor. She was
                    fatherless, with a mother who was a grand woman, but had somewhat of a worldly taint. Perhaps I
                    should say she was prudent. She did not approve of long engagements, nor exchange of letters. The
                    youth went South to continue the study of his profession and begin his practice. He was eighteen,
                    she still younger. A mischievous little girl called out at an evening party on which a sudden
                    silence had fallen: "Mary Field cried when Harry Floyd went away." Everybody
                    smiled. It was only a boy and girl affair to the two parted. They never met again. He studied and
                    entered on the practice of medicine. His prospects were good and he prepared to claim his bride,
                    when, like a death blow, came the tidings that she was married. She had succumbed to the influence
                    and authority of her mother and to the entreaties of a wooer who was both gentle and rich.</p>
            <p>The young man lost heart, dropped his hard-won practice, fell out of the race, married a poor, pretty
                    orphan, and buried himself <pb n="135" id="VAA4025-008-3-035"/> on a Southern plantation, which was
                    itself hidden in a tangled wilderness of wild cane, vines, palmetto, wide-spreading gum, and tall
                    funereal cypress draped in long gray Spanish moss. It was a gloomy place, but it suited him, and his
                    child-wife was unconsciously happy in a home of her own. There he said once, to almost the only
                    friend of early days he had seen in many years: "Do you remember Mary Field?’
                    "Yes," was the surprised reply, for the friend knew or guessed the story, and Mary
                    was dead. "Well," he went on, "she is my first thought when I wake from
                    deep sleep, whether it be in the morning or at deep midnight. And so it will be if I live to be
                    ninety." He has long lain in his grave, and they are both forgotten, except by a few
                    faithful hearts.</p>
            <p>The rival papers of the town were, after the removal of the capital from Corydon, the Democrat and
                    the Journal, the former printed by Morrison &amp; Bolton. The latter was owned and published by
                    Douglass &amp; Maguire. Mr. Douglass was State printer and moved with the capital, as did the
                    other State officers. It took eleven days to make the journey from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river to where our city now stands. It was no light thing to get up even a weekly in
                    those days. The news from Europe was nearly two months in arriving. News from the East was ten or
                    twelve days behind time. No railroads, no telegraphs. There is no nobler trade than that of the
                    printer. And if ever there was a pure man in his place it was John Douglass, editor and proprietor
                    of the Indiana Journal.</p>
            <p>The rival hotels were opposite each other in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> street, near where the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> store now stands. They were kept by John Hawkins and Samuel Henderson, both
                    Kentuckians. The arrival of the stage coach was always announced by the driver with a grand flourish
                    and blowing of horns. The young men of the settlement gathered about the doors of the taverns on
                    summer evenings to watch the coming of the stage and the unloading of passengers. On a certain day,
                    from the door of the coach, stepped a well-to-do mother, and behind her, one after <pb n="136" id="VAA4025-008-3-036"/> the other, followed with dignity and grace five lovely young women.
                    What an acquisition to the town!</p>
            <p>Instantly one of the young men chose his love. Before long he married the girl of his choice. The
                    mother was the grandmother of Mrs. John D. Howland, and the young man who married one of the
                    daughters was her father, the late Alfred Harrison. Of the other daughters, one became the wife of
                    Dr. Charles McDougal. an army surgeon; another of John Finley, author of "The
                    Hoosier's Nest," and another of Rishop Ames. The remaining daughter, Pamela
                    Hanson, never married.</p>
            <p>As early as 1823 there were in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> three churches—the Baptist, at the corner of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> and South Meridian streets; Wesley Chapel, at the corner of North Meridian and the
                    Circle, and the Preshyterian, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> street, near the center of the first square south of Market. The latter was a frame
                    building, costing with the lot $1,600. The house was built before the church was formed,
                    hut on July 5, 1823, an organization of fifteen members was completed and on the following day
                    possession was taken of the new building. The pulpit was supplied for the first year by two home
                    missionaries, of which the Rev. Isaac Reed, a queer specimen of theology, was one, and the Rev.
                    David C. Proctor, the other. In July, 1824, the Rev. George Rush, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Morristown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, accepted the pastorate and was installed in March, 182.5. A modest salary of
                    $400 was promised him, if it could be raised. My parents attended this church, and so my
                    early memories begin here.</p>
            <p>The lecture room, which was also rented for day schools, was a part of the main building, hut shut
                    off from it by wooden doors, which, when it became necessary to throw the rooms together, were
                    raised and fastened to the ceiling by iron clamps. I recollect when a little child, too young as yet
                    to go to church or to attend school regularly, going as a visitor, with my sisters. I entertained
                    myself by climbing on a seat, and on my knees peeping through a crack in the great door. The ceiling
                    of the main room was painted a light blue, after the style of the Hollanders of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. In my childish innocence, heaven itself could not <pb n="137" id="VAA4025-008-3-037"/>
                    surpass the beauty before me. But as I grew older and arose to the dignity of attending Sunday
                    services, the room devoted to worship was not found to be so lovely.</p>
            <p>The building was set back in the yard and there were two front doors in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> street. The high pulpit was between these doors. Two aisles ran through the main room
                    back of the lecture room. The pews were dark, with a ledge of darker wood at the top. They were
                    cushionless. There was no carpet. Those were not the days when the service of God was softened or
                    made easy to the Christian. As to lights—Deuteronomy Jones says: "They
                    ain't nothin' more innercent than a lighted candle—kep' away
                    up on the wall out o' the draft, the way they is in church," and our church was
                    lighted with tallow candles in tin sconces on the wall. There was a small gallery over the school in
                    which seats were provided for the few colored people that had followed their masters from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and who lived and died in service. The congregation was good, the Presbyterian families
                    of the town attending conscientiously. The services were long and strictly orthodox. Very little
                    liberty of thought or action was allowed. One pastor was denounced for his wicked reading of
                    Shakespeare. And novels! No habit could be more pernicious or vile in the sight of pastor or elders.
                    The people alone were not rebuked. One preacher leaned from the pulpit and cried, "Elders!
                    Where are our elders? We have but one—and he, a milk and water man!"</p>
            <p>As it was in medicine at that time, the most stringent and severe remedies were used for even the
                    simplest ailments, so our theologians knew no antidotes but the most rigorous. On communion Sunday
                    the long table spread with a snowy cloth was stretched in front of the pulpit. The members were
                    gathered about the table and opportunity was given by the pastor, while the sheep sang, "
                    'Twas on that dark and doleful night," for the goats to retire. The choir sat on
                    the side seat, south of the pulpit. Why should I not name them? They have years ago joined the
                    "choir invisible"—Mr. and Mrs. Caleb Scudder and their young boarder,
                    John L. Ketcham. They were all fine singers. <pb n="138" id="VAA4025-008-3-038"/> But the hymns and
                    tunes were few and oft repeated. How sweet to the drowsy ear of the waking child were the words:
                        <quote rend="blockquote"> Welcome sweet day of rest That saw the Lord arise, </quote> sung to "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lisbon</settlement>

                        sing, </quote> to the old tune of "Silver Street." Or when the occupant of the
                    pulpit chanced to be a reader full of thought and feeling, how those sweet words<quote rend="blockquote">The hill of Zion yields A thousand sacred sweets Before we reach the heavenly
                        fields, </quote> touched the thoughtless hearer. And then, surpassing all, can any that ever
                    heard that hymn, "All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name," sung by this choir,
                    ever forget its glory? The soul, even of the child, was uplifted and heaven seemed to open. This
                    choir of three occasionally sang an anthem. The one beginning, "The Lord is risen,
                    indeed," was a favorite. The congregation could give no assistance, and so, when the
                    counter solo was reached, the treble went up to it. One who tells me of this says: "To this
                    day it is fine, except the counter line." Rarely was a new tune introduced, but on a lucky
                    or unlucky day one of the members of the church went East and chanced to hear
                    "Boylston," a tune interspersed with grace notes. He was so delighted with it that
                    on his return he raised it five times in one Sunday!</p>
            <p>Thus things went on until 1837, at which time the division in the Presbyterian church throughout the
                    Union of the old and new school took place. There were among the members those who held the
                    strongest Calvinistic views. They could not give up one iota. The consequence was that fifteen
                    members asked to be dismissed and speedily formed the Second Presbyterian <pb n="139" id="VAA4025-008-3-039"/> church. Feeling was high on both sides. We can now scarcely believe
                    that it could have been so strong with Christians. On the first Sunday after the division the
                    wandering sheep, being unable to obtain a pastor, returned to the fold to take communion with their
                    former brethren. They were not invited to join in the service. They sat silent, one dissenter only
                    being brave enough to claim his acceptance through a common Saviour, went forward and partook of the
                    bread and wine. This instance takes us back to Christ's time, when His disciples came
                    saying: "Master, we saw one casting out devils in Thy name and we forbade him, because he
                    followed not us." And the calm reply was, "Forbid him not. He that is not against
                    us is for us."</p>
            <p>About this time, or perhaps a little earlier, Christ's church, on the Circle, was formed,
                    its members being principally from the First church. The Rev. Mr. McKennon, of the First church,
                    resigned and the two feeble churches were without leaders. Soon, however, three strong intellectual
                    clergymen were living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Rev. Edwin R. Ames was appointed presiding elder of this district, and was soon
                    made bishop of the Methodist church of Indiana. The Rev. Phineas D. Gurley was called to the
                    pastorate of the First church, which place he occupied for nine years. He was then called to a fine
                    church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and was afterward appointed chaplain to Congress. In an upper room "of the
                    old county seminary," within a stone's throw of where the Second church now
                    stands, a young man, not striking in appearance, and only twenty-six years old, preached his trial
                    sermon to the feeble colony. It struck home. A call was given and eight happy years of Henry Ward
                    Beecher's life were spent in the service of the Second church. But I might more truthfully
                    say he served the whole of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Every one knew him. His love of flowers and of gardening drew him to the whole
                    community, and to this day there are shrubs growing and flowers blooming, the gift of this preacher
                    of many years ago. His love of nature drew him nearer both to God and man. Under his earnest
                    ministration his church grew rapidly and in a short time was stronger than its parent. Mr. Gurley
                    and Mr. Beecher <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-008-3-040"/> were warm friends, and this friendship served
                    to unite the divided churches.</p>
            <p>In close connection with the church of whatever denomination in the early days was the Sunday school,
                    where the children might be trained early in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The first
                    Sunday school, a miscellaneous affair, was held in the cabinet shop of Caleb Scudder, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> streets. This was before my day, but I recollect the kind of terror I felt on passing
                    the door of the shop. This aforesaid door was painted green and filled with broad-headed,
                    hand-wrought nails, for the purpose, it was said, of turning the edges of the hatchets of the
                    Indians and thus obtaining safety from their assaults. The little shop stood on the corner for years
                    and was always associated in our childish minds with the first Sunday school and the frightful
                    Indian.</p>
            <p>Afterward the Union Sunday school was held in the Presbyterian church. But as soon as superintendent
                    and teachers could be obtained, each denomination went to itself. The Sunday school of the
                    Presbyterian church proper was an institution for the strict religious training of its children.
                    Everything was solemn. The hymns were slowly sung. The prayers which were started on their way to
                    the throne of God went up with awful solemnity. The lessons—can we ever forget them? Each
                    child was required to commit to memory whole chapters. A certain number of questions from the
                    shorter catechism must be answered promptly and distinctly, and at the close of school a text of
                    Scripture, appropriate to the lesson, was recited by each scholar. And then the talks with the
                    innocent child on that mysterious gift, called the soul! Nothing in the whole world was so dreadful
                    as this same gift.</p>
            <p>Strict obedience was required. In case of failure instant dismissal followed. A boy of fifteen was
                    told to march with his class up the aisles and before the pulpit, taking the circuit of the room.
                    Being timid, he refused. The command was given to obey or leave the school. He chose to leave, and a
                    hymn was solemnly sung after his departure: <pb n="141" id="VAA4025-008-3-041"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">How painful 'tis to turn away A scholar from our school. </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Think of a muse descending to such dishwashing business!</p>
            <p>The library was made up of books published by the American Sunday School Union. My memory still holds
                    in sweet possession such stories as "Anna ROSS," "Ruth Lee and the
                    Persecuted Family," and "Henry and His Bearer."
                    "Pilgrim's Progress" and the "Holy War" were great
                    treasures.</p>
            <p>There was one gala day in the year. This was the Fourth of July. It was a grand affair, and how we
                    looked forward to it with longing and hope; and backward—well, I will not spoil the glory
                    by painfully recalling the long march through the hot sun, the tired feet, the dusty streets, the
                    pretty white dresses all soiled and torn, and the weeds! We found rest and delight in some beautiful
                    grove where perhaps some Revolutionary hero sat as figure-head on the platform, and some embryo
                    student gave us his views on the growth of the country. After the oration we were regaled with cold
                    well water and rusk from the crude bakery. Then with screams of delight we all joined in singing:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light?</quote>
            </p>
            <p>Who that ever participated can ever forget the proud bearing of Mr. James Blake as he led forth this
                    army of young heroes to glorify our country and Independence day? I recollect two girls from the
                    backwoods shouting out as he galloped back and forth with his gay trappings and prancing steed:
                    "See! see how he looks like Napoleon Bonaparte."</p>
            <p>Soon after the settlement of the town, families coming from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>,

                    </placeName> formed a fine class of citizens. The day school was started. When there was no teacher,
                    as sometimes happened, a citizen, college bred, took up for a time the training of the children, and
                    even a room was given in a private house for a teacher who could not pay rent.</p>
            <p>But about 1825 or 1826 a gentleman, a professor of Transylvania <pb n="142" id="VAA4025-008-3-042"/>
                    University, moved his family from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> into this newly made town. His work was ready for him. In the little back room of the
                    Presbyterian church, Ebenezer Sharpe, of blessed memory, took up the sweet task of teaching the
                    children of the town. He was a fine classical scholar, and taught Latin and Greek as well as
                    English. The opening of the school each morning with the reading of Scripture and prayer is still
                    fresh in the minds of some who were then his pupils. He was a fine reader, and the eloquent language
                    of the eighth chapter of Romans and the voice and fervor of the reader still live in connection.
                    "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or anguish, or
                    persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?" I do not know whether
                    Murray's English reader or its introduction had then reached so far West, but often the
                    eloquent words of Paul were used for practice in reading. This teacher was always called
                    "Old Mr. Sharpe," and age was associated with him. I think his gentle ways and
                    kindly manner gave reason for it. Some years ago I stood by his grave and read on the stone, to my
                    amazement: "In memory of Ebenezer Sharpe, who died in the fifty-sixth year of his
                    age." I have a little poem written by him October 15, 1830. It is an invitation to the
                    family of John G. Brown to attend the wedding of his daughter, and is as follows:</p>
            <p>Brother Brown: <quote rend="blockquote">There is a lass within our town, They call her Isabella; Not
                        satisfied to live alone, She's bent on a good fellow. To-morrow when the sun goes down
                        For this we'll have a party, To which pray bring good sister Brown, Eliza and Miss
                        Barbee.</quote>
                </p>
            <p>As the town grew the schools became more numerous, of course. Among the teachers about 1830 was a Mr.
                    McPherson, <pb n="143" id="VAA4025-008-3-043"/> of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was a well-dressed young man, who by his gentlemanly appearance excited the envy
                    and jealousy and finally the hatred of a few low-down ferrymen. There was then no "old
                    bridge" across White river. One lovely Sunday morning the young man started for a walk in
                    the woods on the other side of the river. He called on the ferryman to row him over. But hatred
                    filled the soul of the brute, and in an evil moment overcame him. The day after the stream bore
                    witness to the wicked deed, for the body of the guiltless young man rose to the surface bearing
                    marks of violence, which were indisputable.</p>
            <p>Other teachers ran their course. Gregg, Dumont, Holliday, Sullivan, Davidson, Marston, Kemper, Lang
                    and Josephus Cicero Worrall. These schools, with the exception of Mr. Holliday's, were open
                    both to boys and girls. The teachers were rigid disciplinarians. The rod and the ferrule were the
                    instruments of punishment for the boys. For the girls, keeping in, ear pulling and standing on the
                    floor. Dr. Johnson said more than one hundred years ago: "There is now less flogging in our
                    schools than formerly, but there is less learned there; so that what the boys get at one end they
                    lose at the other." The abatement of flogging in the schools of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had not begun in the early thirties.</p>
            <p>There was an infant school, a kind of premonitory kindergarten, taught by Miss Sergeant, also a fine
                    school for girls, taught by Miss Brooks and Miss Sawyer from near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and later, Miss Hooker, followed by the Miss Axtells. These schools were popular. In
                    testimony to the inexpensiveness of education in those early days, I give an old bill (receipted)

            <p>Going home from school one day, my walk for a short distance lay underneath a row of generous cherry
                    trees filled with the radiant fruit. I walked slowly on the grass; there were few pavements in those
                    days. The birds had loosened the pretty cherries. I picked them from the grass and ate them. While
                    thus employed I lifted my eyes and saw coming across the street a little girl I had never before
                    seen. There was something wondrously fascinating about a stranger. Her heavy dark hair hung about
                    her neck, her black eyes fairly startled me. She had on a blue calico dress, and, oh, wonderful to
                    relate, a black silk apron—embroidered in the corners. I had never seen anything quite so
                    pretentious. My own dress was gingham, surmounted by a gingham apron, hung from the shoulders. She
                    walked straight up to me and looked me in the face. I looked at her. We spake never a word. She
                    turned and went back across the street to her home, and I went to mine. This was my first meeting
                    with Laura Ream.</p>
            <p>We are sometimes inclined to undervalue the cultivation of this early period. But ladies were ladies
                    then as now. Even now all the advantages of education and refinement cannot, to use a homely adage,
                    "make a silk purse out of a sow's ear." Among my mother's
                    friends I do not recollect loud voices or rude manners. Among these women were those who were quiet
                    and gentle, or bright and sparkling, often dressed with exquisite taste. It was a delight to see the
                    lady of the "new purchase" put on her pretty striped silk or olive green satin,
                    place her soft lace cap (for all married ladies wore caps) over her abundant hair, and enter into a
                    company either as guest or hostess. They were ladies, and they entertained gentlemen, such as
                    Governor Noble, the Supreme judges, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Blackford</region>
                    </placeName>, Downey and Sullivan, and Judge Huntingdon and McLean, and young men afterward of high
                    mark, as Richard W. Thompson and Hugh McCulloch, and our own gentlemen. Such men would not have
                    spent evenings with ill-mannered fools for company. Society was good—in one respect
                    better than now. There was then none of that snobbery which fears for its respectability.</p>
            <pb n="145" id="VAA4025-008-3-045"/>
            <p>We step with reverent tread over the dear past. We look back to the earnest, honest, liberal men, to
                    the brave, unselfish, hospitable women of that time, and glory in their lives. They builded better
                    than they knew. The ample grounds and fine old houses of fifty years ago have given place to stately
                    churches and generous schoolhouses. They left us a rare inheritance—the firm foundation
                    of this beautiful city. Let us see that we keep it unimpaired and hand it down to coming generations
                    as it was given to us.</p>

            <p rend="center">NEWSPAPER HISTORY—THE STRAWTOWN MYTH.</p>
            <p>Much has been said of the fiction in history—even the history that is accepted as
                    reputable—and when it comes to a certain kind of loosely written local history based upon
                    vague tradition and the desire to make a "story," the "history"
                    not infrequently becomes pure fiction. History as written by newspaper space-fillers is quite often
                    of this character; and as it is, perhaps, more widely read and receives just as much credence as
                    bona fide history, one is almost tempted sometimes to wonder why one should take the trouble to try
                    to get at the truth of things, anyway.</p>
            <p>A fair example of what we mean is a "good stuff" story which bobs up in the papers
                    periodically to the effect that the village of Strawtown, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton county</region>
                    </placeName>, came within one vote of being chosen as the place for the State's capital.
                    One variant of the story is that on that fateful day when the commissioners who had the business in
                    hand came to vote on the location, one or two who favored Strawtown had gone fishing and did not get
                    to vote; hence Strawtown missed the chance of its life. Evidently this has been told so often in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Strawtown</settlement>
                    </placeName> that the citizens of that historically ambitious burg really believe it. One feels some
                    curiosity as to how the tradition ever got started.</p>
            <p>In the first place, in 1820, when the capital was located, there was no Strawtown, except as the site
                    of an Indian village, and there is not the slightest record that the commissioners ever visited it
                    or gave it a thought. The documents bearing upon that important work are very few, the only
                    circumstantial one being the journal of John Tipton, one of the commissioners. The question of
                    location was decided at the cabin of John McCormick, where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands, and there is nothing said about <pb n="147" id="VAA4025-008-3-047"/> any
                    division of sentiment. The only source of information we have upon this point simply says:
                    "We met at McCormick's, and, on my motion, the commissioners came to a resolution
                    to select and locate," etc.; the "etc." being a description of the ground
                    chosen.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the Strawtown myth will continue to be a source of profit to space-fillers, and in
                    time, no doubt, will find its way into respectable history company and pass there for bona fide.</p>
            <p rend="center">INDIAXA GEOGRAPHICAL NOMENCLATURE.</p>
            <p>We call attention to Mr. J. P. Dunn's article in this number on "Indiana
                    Geographical Nomenclature," called forth by an article under the same caption in our last
                    issue. Mr. Dunn's contribution, dealing almost entirely with our Indian names. on which he
                    speaks as an authority, illustrates the corruptions that are common, not only to the forms of these
                    borrowed names that perpetuate the memory of a vanished race. but also to the origin and meanings of
                    them. It is a contribution of value.</p>
            <p rend="center">OLD INDIANAPOLIS MAP.</p>
            <p>Among the recent acquisitions of the State Library is a map of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. engraved in 1836 by W. Woodruff, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and published by William Sullivan. who is also given as the surveyor. This map is
                    exceedingly rare. it being, indeed. a discovery to local antiquarians. It shows the platting of the
                    out lots of the Donation surrounding the mile square as laid out by Alexander Ralston, and also
                    locates certain public houses and residences of that day. In Ralston's map of 1821 squares
                    12. 19 and 90 are shown as unplatted reservations, and the rectangular system of streets with the
                    four diagonals is broken by North and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> streets, running parallel with Pogue's run on either side. In the map of 1836
                    the reservations are platted into lots and the two streets mentioned do not appear. A unique feature
                    is a supplementary engraving of four concentric circles surrounding a picture of the State House. In
                    the first circular space are the counties of the State arranged in alphabetical order and radiating
                    from the center. In the next space <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-008-3-048"/> are the corresponding county
                    seats; in the third their distance in miles from the capital, and in the fourth their direction. The
                    engraving is beautifully done and the map is as good as new.</p>
            <p rend="center">STATE RANKING IN INDIANA.</p>
            <p>Number 15 of "The Indiana University Studies" is a study in "State Ranking
                    in Indiana" from 1814 to 1873, by Logan Esarey, A. M. It represents a part of the work that
                    is being attempted in the history of the State by the Indiana Historical Survey, organized under the
                    direction of the Department of History and Political Science of the University at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and it shows the high standard of that work, a brief description of which was given in
                    our last issue. Mr. Esarey's handling of this important subject is the most ambitious and
                    the most thorough that has yet appeared. The body of it deals with the first and second State banks,
                    the free banks of 1852. and the Bank of the State of Indiana, of 1855. There are statistical
                    appendices, and a bibliography of sources.</p>

                    </placeName>, celebrated her fortieth anniversary by a home-coining. For further information about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> we would refer the reader to a historical sketch of the place in this magazine for
                    December, 1911. The celebration was quite in keeping with the character of the "classic
                    suburb." There were cordial informal gatherings with plenty of the best music procurable;
                    "seeing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>

                    the Butler College campus, in which everybody joined, and gorgeous fireworks capping the festival.
                    The greatest feature, perhaps, of the occasion was an afternoon—an ideally pleasant
                    summer afternoon—on the shady greensward of the large school yard, with a diversified
                    program of addresses, reminiscences and music. The speech-making was graceful, witty and genial.</p>
            <p>The home-coming custom is spreading through Indiana year by year; and it is a beautiful custom, that
                    carries with it much that is quickening.</p>
