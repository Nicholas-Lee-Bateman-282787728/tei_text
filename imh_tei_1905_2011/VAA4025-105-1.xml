                    businessmen had founded was surviving but far from thriving when they happened
                    on a product that would catapult their firm to national fame. The Hoosier
                    cabinet, a freestanding cupboard equipped with ingenious mechanical devices,
                    consolidated storage and maximized the efficiency of kitchen labor, thereby
                    alleviating some of the most exasperating aspects of the middle-class
                    housewife&apos;s daily responsibilities. This article examines how a modest

                <p>Women&apos;s lives during the late 1800s were quite different from our own.
                    For working-class and rural women, general housekeeping involved real physical
                    labor. Most tasks had to be done by hand-churning butter, stoking stoves with
                    wood or coal carried from the porch or cellar, chopping and mixing and washing.
                    Kitchens were sparsely furnished, usually with a worktable and sink, a storage
                    cupboard, and a few open shelves; dry goods purchased from the grocer were kept
                    in a pantry, along with rows of the canned goods that most women made from
                    homegrown produce. Kitchens were also typically large; a basic work area of 14
                    by 18 feet was not unusual, <list type="footnotes">

                    such as a cellar or pantry, in addition to an outdoor yard. An average housewife
                    walked thousands of steps each day in the course of food preparation and cleanup
                    alone.</p>
                <p>Even middle-class women who could afford paid help found everyday life to be far
                    from easy. Servants often brought trouble into their mistresses&apos; homes
                    - communication problems, personality conflicts, and differences in domestic
                    habits - and domestic help, good or bad, was becoming increasingly hard to find.
                    The factories of the rapidly growing manufacturing sector were hungry for labor,
                    and, despite poor pay and significant hardships, employment in book binderies,
                    paper mills, and button shops often proved more appealing than domestic service,
                    with its preponderance of fickle and unreasonably demanding employers.<hi
                        rend="sup">1</hi> The problem, from the workers&apos; perspective, was
                    summed up nicely by a woman who contrasted her servant friends&apos;
                    existence with her own experience in industry: &quot;[T]hey&apos;re
                    never sure of one minute that&apos;s their own when they&apos;re in the
                    [mistresses&apos;] house .... Our day [in the factory],&quot; she
                    continued, &quot;is ten hours long, but when it&apos;s done
                    it&apos;s done, and we can do what we like with the evenings.&quot;<hi
                        rend="sup">2</hi></p>
                <p>As domestic servants exchanged their harried positions for the structure and
                    independence of industrial work, their former mistresses were forced back into
                    their own kitchens, where they found themselves at a loss. After years -
                    sometimes generations - of depending on hired labor to deal with the innumerable
                    basic tasks of everyday life, many lacked the expertise required to provide for
                    their families.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> What was a young housewife to make of a
                    recipe that told her to take &quot;a pinch of this, and a little of that,
                    and considerable of the other, and cook them till they are done about
                    right&quot;? The literature of the period suggests that overcooked dinners,
                    sagging cakes, and other minor disasters led frequently to household strife, but
                    there was little formal instruction available in how to remedy such problems.
                    Moreover, despite the considerable skill, creativity, and effort involved in
                    kitchen-related enterprises, many middle-class Americans held such work in low
                    regard, a fact that did nothing to fuel the housewife&apos;s motivation.<hi

                <p>Catharine Beecher, one of the century&apos;s most influential writers and
                    activists, sought to address this disparity at both its individual and its
                    broader social levels. With her equally well-known sister Harriet Beecher Stowe,
                    she published and lectured on the need for formal instruction in the house -
                    keeping arts, arguing that proficient, wholesome housekeeping would have
                    wide-reaching effects on American society as a whole. Beyond providing practical
                    guidance that ranged from recipes for calf&apos;s foot blancmange and egg
                    frizzle to her impressively detailed design for a kitchen work cupboard that she
                    called a &quot;cooking form,&quot; Beecher published an astonishing
                    variety of insights into the all-too-often stifling effects of domestic life on
                    the American woman&apos;s spirit.<hi rend="sup">5</hi></p>
                <p>As Barbara Welter and others have convincingly argued, women&apos;s attempts
                    to live up to nineteenth-century ideals of womanhood bred resentment. Day after
                    day spent alone at home in housework that was not just exhausting, but accorded
                    little-if any-respect, left wives with what we would call low self-esteem, not
                    to mention a lack of energy and enthusiasm for family activities by the end of
                    the day.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Understanding that women needed to feel as though
                    their contributions were valued both by their husbands and family at home and in
                    the wider socio-political sphere, Beecher argued that housekeeping, no less than
                    other forms of business, should be formally taught, and that it warranted the
                    cachet of domestic science. While she supported home beautification and other
                    pursuits on the grounds that these would promote the happy temperament so
                    encouraging to godly living, she cautioned against overspending on such relative
                    frivolities, as doing so could kindle domestic strife. Strife, above all, must
                    be avoided; a husband who was &quot;wearied with endless

                <p>During the first few decades of the nineteenth century, most shops advanced
                    beyond dependence on hand tools to equipment powered by horses, dogs, water, and
                    steam. <placeName>

                    the manufacture of leather products.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> By the mid-nineteenth
                    century many shops had several employees, and mechanization had enabled some
                    establishments&apos; production to outpace demand, resulting in inventory

                    most renowned product of the state&apos;s industry - the Wooton Desk,
                    patented in 1874, which became an international status symbol among businessmen,
                    politicians, and other men of wealth and power.<hi rend="sup">13</hi></p>
                <p>Mechanization was accompanied by a scientific attitude toward business
                    efficiency, one result of which was the time and motion study. Coinciding with
                    this trend, selling was increasingly regarded as a profession in its own right;
                    every aspect of the field was analyzed and refined, from advertising copy and
                    promotional events to the most effective ways for salesmen in retail stores to
                    stand, move, and smile while demonstrating their products. All of these
                    developments would play a role in the design, manufacture, and sales of the

                    horse-drawn carts, someone in the shop had started to make kitchen cabinets. We
                    have no account of exactly how these first few cabinets came to be produced.
                    Perhaps one of the owners&apos; wives had requested a prototype that she
                    could try out in her kitchen. We do know that the company thought the cabinets
                    had potential as a secondary product to ensure regular income during winter
                    months, when equipment sales to farmers would likely be slow.</p>
                <p>Whatever the case, the company had a few kitchen cabinets on hand when the
                    principals realized that the seed separators were going to be a hard sell. The
                    morning after the meeting in which they had discussed the disappointing farm
                    equipment sales, they sent out each of their four wagons with a cabinet on
                    board, in addition to the regular complement of seed separators. The results
                    were stunning, as the senior McQuinn would later describe: <quote
                        rend="blockquote">[T]he drivers all came in and reported that they had sold
                        the kitchen cabinet to practically the first prospect, but they brought
                        nearly all of the seed separators back unsold. The second day each took two
                        cabinets and one seed separator and that night all cabinets were reported
                        easily sold. The third day each driver took three kitchen cabinets and long
                        before night they all returned entirely sold out. That settled the question
                        definitely as to what line of furniture we should make.<hi rend="sup"

                    working surface for kneading or rolling out dough, and the shallow, two-door

                    were additional influences as well.</p>
                <p>In basic form, the Hoosier cabinet is not radically distinct from several other
                    types of cupboard that preceded its invention. As long ago as the sixteenth
                    century, English kitchens included a piece of furniture known as a dresser, on
                    which meat would be prepared, or dressed. In addition to its work surface, the
                    dresser (which has since come to be most widely known as a Welsh dresser) had a
                    shallow upper section with open shelves for storing linens and dishes. British
                    colonists imported this type of cabinet to <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                    </placeName>, where the form became refined over time to suit peculiarly
                    American needs.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Step-back cupboards, which featured a
                    deeper base cabinet with two doors below a shallow upper section usually
                    enclosed by two glazed doors, were also widely used in kitchens of the mid- to
                    late nineteenth century.</p>
                <p>In 1887, more than ten years before the Hoosier Manufacturing Company was
                    founded, a certain John Roth patented a design for a cabinet with compartments
                    for dishes, pies, small pots, and other kitchen wares, in addition to a
                    dedicated space for flour, drawers for coffee, tea, and spices, and a kneading
                    board for bread. The following statement by Roth, about whose creation little
                    more is known, is especially compelling in view of the claims that would be made
                    several years later by the various manufacturers of Hoosier cabinets: <quote
                        rend="blockquote">My kitchen dresser is particularly adapted to the use of
                        small families and will promote comfort and convenience of such by

                        utensils for preparing and enjoying the same and at the same time the utmost
                        economy of space is secured.<hi rend="sup">18</hi></quote></p>
                <p>Another nineteenth-century development that contributed to the Hoosier
                    cabinet&apos;s distinctive design was the invention of wall-hung bins, which
                    provided sanitary storage of flour while allowing for easy and economical
                    dispensing. The bins could be purchased in different sizes and supplied with
                    their own sifters.<hi rend="sup">19</hi></p>

                <p>Early versions of the Hoosier cabinet had the lower section fitted with racks to
                    store dishes and a pull-out shelf for storing pots, pans, and other larger
                    items. The lower section also had a bread bin and drawers for utensils and
                    linens. On this base was mounted a counter that could be extended for a user
                    seated at a stool; the counter was built of wood with a zinc or enameled top for
                    ease of cleaning. The upper section was shallower and housed a flour dispenser,
                    usually with its own built-in sifter; hooks for hanging small utensils; racks
                    for storing spices and jars of extracts; a holder for the housewife&apos;s
                    rolling pin; space for jars of coffee, tea, and sugar; and shelves for smaller
                    dishes, glassware, and cups. Later versions became increasingly sophisticated in
                    their accoutrements and styling, eventually including meal-planning computers,
                    daily reminders for grocery trips, and helpful household hints.</p>
                <p>What differentiated the Hoosier cabinet most markedly from its predecessors -
                    aside from the intriguing cabinet described by Roth, above - was its
                    meticulously organized interior storage, a testament to the late
                    nineteenth-century preoccupation with functional design. The Beecher sisters had
                    advocated such attention to planning and detail for kitchen work in the middle
                    of the century, and efficiency expert Frederick Winslow Taylor had perfected its
                    applications to the work of office and factory. The Wooton desk had exemplified
                    this fascination with system and efficiency in brilliant style, and some
                    scholars have seen precedents for the Hoosier cabinet&apos;s interior
                    organization in the furniture of the late nineteenth-century office.<hi
                        rend="sup">20</hi> Just as the Wooton businessman&apos;s desk had come
                    to symbolize its user&apos;s status, the Hoosier cabinet would transcend the
                    scope of mundane kitchen furniture, providing a material signifier of a
                    woman&apos;s culinary and other domestic skills.</p>

                <p>The systematic and ergonomic design of the Hoosier cabinet genuinely expedited
                    meal preparation and consolidated kitchen storage. But mere features alone,
                    however helpful, cannot account for the millions of cabinets that would find
                    their way into American homes. To understand why the cabinets became such a
                    runaway success we have to appreciate the part played in this story by the
                    increasingly sophisticated profession of sales, which not only promoted the
                    cabinets by making them accessible to buyers, but extolled their many benefits
                    as well.</p>
                <p>The history of the Hoosier cabinet illustrates how early twentieth-century
                    manufacturers enthusiastically put these principles of salesmanship and
                    marketing into practice. The Hoosier Manufacturing Company, whose promotional
                    budget and visionary sales strategies vastly surpassed those of any other firm,
                    advertised in newspapers and magazines almost from its inception. By the 1920s,
                    Hoosier was spending almost a quarter-million dollars annually on advertising.
                    In an effort to capitalize on the interest generated by these advertisements,
                    the company established dealer relationships with furniture stores. However,
                    most businesses were less than enthusiastic at the prospect of devoting precious
                    floor space to mere kitchen cabinets. In 1904 the firm publicized a plan to sell
                    to customers directly, cutting out the middlemen, but they later found it most
                    expedient to establish their own network of
                    &quot;Hoosier-authorized&quot; dealers, and they artfully coordinated
                    their advertising in print media with promotional events at these localized
                        venues.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> By 1916 there were over 5,000 dealers, and the
                    company had sold more than a million cabinets.</p>
                <p>As countless advertisements for Hoosier cabinets show, the purveyors of these
                    &quot;step savers&quot; profited richly from the Beecher
                    sisters&apos; insights and creativity. The promotion of &quot;equable
                    and cheerful temper and tone in the housekeeper&quot; proved a spectacular
                    means to increase sales. Although only a few advertisements explicitly cited the
                    Beechers (and it is Catharine whose wisdom was most often invoked), the
                    sisters&apos; influence is unmistakable. Not only had they literally
                    provided a blueprint for the cabinet&apos;s essential design, with their
                    drawing of the cooking form; their writings had enumerated exactly those areas
                    of the middle-class housewife&apos;s daily existence that warranted
                    remediation - a list that, for these businesses, translated to unmined veins of
                    gold.</p>

                <p>Worn out? The new kitchen cabinet promised to reduce the overall amount of labor
                    the housewife had to perform, as well as make each step of that labor less
                    physically taxing. Feeling unappreciated? The investment of $50 required to
                    purchase a Hoosier cabinet would provide a concrete symbol of the esteem in
                    which a housewife&apos;s work was held by her spouse. Wondering what your
                    education was for, when you spend so much of your daily life in menial labor?
                    The cabinet&apos;s diverse, ingenious appurtenances would indicate to the
                    woman of the house and to others that the challenges of kitchen work were many
                    and real; why else would &quot;efficiency experts&quot; have devoted so
                    much attention to inventing such equipment? Beyond all of these remedies to
                    domestic woes there also lay a positive reason to buy this cabinet: the simple
                    beauty of the object as a piece of furniture would make the housewife&apos;s
                    time in her kitchen a rewarding pleasure. Finally, the presence of a Hoosier
                    cabinet in a woman&apos;s home would demonstrate to family and friends her
                    embrace of modern ideals.</p>
                <p>The various manufacturers of Hoosier cabinets employed a variety of print media
                    for advertising, from local newspapers to national magazines. Some of these
                    publications were directed at a female readership - <hi rend="i">The
                        Ladies&apos; Home Journal</hi>, <hi rend="i">Good Housekeeping</hi>, <hi
                        rend="i">Better Homes and Gardens</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Woman&apos;s
                        Home Companion</hi>, among them. Others, which included <hi rend="i">Liberty
                        Magazine</hi>, <hi rend="i">Everybody&apos;s Magazine</hi>, and <hi
                        rend="i">The Saturday Evening Post</hi>, were intended for general
                    readers.</p>
                <p>Others still were directed specifically at husbands. In its earlier years, the
                    Hoosier Manufacturing Company advertised in farm publications such as <hi
                        rend="i">National Stockman and Farmer Magazine</hi> and <hi rend="i"
                        >Breeder&apos;s Gazette</hi>. The male head of the household would,
                    after all, be paying for the cabinet&apos;s purchase. But the most telling
                    bit of advertising directed at men must surely be a 1913 example published in
                        <hi rend="i">Country Gentleman</hi>. Entitled &quot;The Moving Picture
                    Story of a Hoosier Cabinet,&quot; it shows three drawings of a housewife. In
                    the first, she &quot;sits while working,&quot; rather than having to
                    stand. The second shows how she can keep all her tools and materials at
                    arm&apos;s reach, which saves her from having to walk around the kitchen.
                    The third plate triumphantly proclaims, &quot;Through Early - Not
                    Tired,&quot; perhaps hinting that the wife might be expected to have energy
                    left for other activities she might engage in with her husband at the end of the
                    day.</p>
                <p>Most of the ads, however, were directed at wives themselves, who could presumably
                    be counted on to suggest to their spouses the positive improvement in every
                    aspect of family life that this modern invention would facilitate. If
                    matter-of-fact suggestion proved unsuccessful, she might badger her husband; how
                    could anyone not afford a Hoosier, when the company offered payment on credit
                    with only a dollar down and forty-nine payments of a dollar a week? While fifty
                    dollars represented a great deal more money in 1900 than it does today, the
                    payment plan brought these cabinets <pb n="14" id="VAA4025-105-1-022"/>within
                    the reach of countless buyers whose income would otherwise have precluded such a
                    purchase. The cabinet would be paid for in a year and provide decades of
                    stalwart service! If the cabinet&apos;s combination of practical features
                    and affordability did not sway a stubborn husband, his wife could point out, as
                    had the piece in <hi rend="i">Country Gentleman</hi>, that this purchase might
                    well garner him more wifely attention.</p>
                <p>Men&apos;s work, being visible in the public sphere, brought financial
                    profit, opportunities, and recognition. The Beecher sisters had understood the
                    importance of such recognition to an individual&apos;s motivation and sense
                    of self-worth. But women, who labored in the home, worked largely by themselves.
                    Their work was also taken for granted, which led to a vicious cycle: feeling
                    underappreciated contributed to low self-esteem, which in turn often led to
                    grumpiness and impatience with family. This syndrome of negativity at least made
                    many women&apos;s housekeeping labors more of a chore than they needed to
                    be, and at worst caused significant household strife. The frequency with which
                    the advertisements promised relief from drudgery and exhaustion certainly
                    suggests that in spite of the nineteenth century&apos;s vaunted ideals,
                    women&apos;s household work had taken a heavy toll on marriage and family
                    life.</p>
                <p>In response to such realities, some Hoosier cabinet advertisements were designed
                    to make women feel that their domestic labors were valued for their
                    contributions beyond the domestic sphere. The authors of these ads undoubtedly
                    understood that this constituted a subtle yet welcome form of flattery - a way
                    of helping women appreciate their part in the larger community. The beef and
                    mutton pie they prepared for dinner, or the calf&apos;s foot blancmange they
                    served for dessert (both are included in <hi rend="i">Miss Beecher&apos;s
                        Domestic Receipt Book</hi>) might have national or even international
                    repercussions. Mrs. X&apos;s husband might be the tradesman responsible for
                    maintaining equipment at the university&apos;s chemistry department. Mrs.
                    Y&apos;s husband might work for the mayor. Perhaps Mrs. W was married to the
                    state governor, or even an ambassador. Who knew what wide-reaching developments
                    might be aided by a husband&apos;s ability to perform well, instead of
                    feebly, on any given day?</p>
                <p>The Sellers company did its own part to persuade women that their labors were
                    valued, enumerating &quot;Added Features That Cost Us Over $100,000
                        Annually.&quot;<hi rend="sup">24</hi> This level of investment by a
                    manufacturer certainly implies the importance of those for whom the investment
                    is made. Nowhere did this ad acknowledge that the cost of these added features,
                    which included an automatic lowering flour bin and ant-proof canisters, was
                    passed on to <list type="footnotes">

                    improvements had been added for their benefit alone, and at the

                    otherwise have cost to make. A third Sellers ad referred to their kitchen

                    to prosper in earthly terms as a means of assuring himself that he was among the
                    chosen few, if a woman owned a &quot;Dutch Kitchenet,&quot; she must be
                    successful. The cabinet&apos;s presence in her kitchen would be a badge of
                    her housekeeping prowess, as enviable as a modern-day Eagle Scout&apos;s
                    award. Imagine how the presence of this cabinet would impress family and
                    neighbors, with its suggestion that it could only have been bought by a husband
                    who greatly valued his wife and looked upon her household responsibilities with
                    the utmost seriousness. The many ads for Hoosier cabinets that cited numbers of
                    kitchen footsteps saved also underscored, by implication, the
                    housewife&apos;s value. Who would take the time to count her footsteps and
                    work to minimize them if those steps did not belong to someone important?</p>
                <p>Counting footsteps proved big business for the makers of Hoosier cabinets. The
                    idea of saving steps has been figurative for so long that most of us have
                    forgotten the origin of this expression in the literal movement of feet.
                    &quot;How many steps in the kitchen preparing three simple meals?&quot;

                    peers out from various corners of the cabinet as she points to its many helpful
                    features, among them a disappearing ironing board and &quot;a mirror for
                    that hasty glance!&quot; The suggestion seems to be that you, too, could
                    become capable and beautiful by using this cabinet. At the very least, Helen
                    Boone could replace your former servant who abandoned you, seeking factory work.

                <p>Other advertisements did even better. Sex sells, and while its use may have been
                    somewhat veiled in much early twentieth-century advertising (at least, the
                    advertising directed at the kind of women whose families would have the means to
                    buy such household improvements), it was handily employed all the same. Why
                    portray a cabinet as a chaste, submissive girl or a sensible home efficiency
                    expert when you could personify it as a stunning, strapping man? The McDougall
                    Company seized this opportunity. &quot;Handsome, tall and
                    competent,&quot; reads one ad from 1920, &quot;your McDougall waits
                    cheerily in the kitchen every morning.&quot; Having helped get your family
                    ready for the day, McDougall then &quot;hurries you out, smiling and fresh,
                    for a bit of relaxation.&quot; Rare among Hoosier cabinet ads, this one just
                    happens to picture a cabinet without its user; her stool sits empty with her
                    apron, discarded, lying suggestively on top. It is hard to view this ad without
                    imagining some additional kind of pleasure, unmentioned, that took place after
                    the work was done. Her husband and children having been ushered off to their
                    respective days, she has untied her apron strings and left the kitchen. What

                    a piece, this ad calls to mind images of the young Sean Connery, or perhaps
                    those musclebound men on the covers of the bodice-ripper romances that would
                    find their way into the kitchens of these same women several decades later.
                    There&apos;s nothing like the anticipation of romance to sweeten even the
                    dullest labors that must, by necessity, precede it.</p>
                <p>The unspoken promises that can reasonably be inferred to relate to sex went on.
                    These were, after all, the early decades of the twentieth century, a time when
                    all manner of supposedly outdated social notions were being abandoned. The
                    promise of sex, while less overt than it would become during the 1960s, was
                    everywhere. Just as today, there was strong pressure to be slender, youthful,
                    and energetic. Expectations of women, too, were changing; women&apos;s
                    demand for voting rights set in motion a train of social effects, one of which
                    was a new emphasis on how they appeared as individuals - not just in terms of
                    beauty, and not just as keepers of the house and mothers of children, but in
                    their capacity as partners within a marriage partnership. It was no longer
                    enough to be a responsible housekeeper, a good cook, and a caring mother; now
                    women began to be judged as conversation partners and objects of desire. There
                    were new standards to be met, and along with them, new reasons to feel anxious
                    and insecure. Just as today, self-doubt was insidiously nurtured by advertisers
                    so that it could then be profitably mined as a potentially inexhaustible means
                    to increase sales. Advertisements in <hi rend="i">Liberty Magazine</hi>, which
                    billed itself as &quot;A Weekly for Everybody,&quot; featured ads for
                    Pepsodent toothpaste (&quot;Cloudy Teeth - dull teeth. How to make them
                    whiter - quickly!&quot;), Lemon Facialax skin-whitening cream, and

                    complaints the cabinets might be expected to help reduce.</p>
                <p>Other ads employ peer pressure of various kinds in an effort to have housewives
                    cajole their husbands into a purchase. &quot;Are you fitting your daughter
                    by example and experience to be a successful home-maker?&quot; asks a
                    McDougall advertisement from 1917. &quot;Are you educating her for the
                    practical work of life? Are you teaching her true economy and
                    efficiency?&quot; After pointing out that the cabinet can be had for only a
                    dollar a week, the ad continues, &quot;You cannot spend this small amount in
                    any way that will be of greater daily benefit to your daughter, your family and
                        yourself.&quot;<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Using the same type of
                    rationalization, the Hoosier Manufacturing Company asserted in various
                    advertisements that &quot;[a] Hoosier Cabinet is not an expense -
                    it&apos;s an investment.&quot;</p>
                <p>The pressure to be modern, to keep up with the times and avoid being left behind
                    by one&apos;s peers, is also employed. &quot;You would not knowingly

                <p>By far the greatest peer pressure was employed by the Hoosier Manufacturing
                    Company. A 1910 advertisement urged readers of <hi rend="i">Good
                        Housekeeping</hi> to join no fewer than 300,000 other women who had already,
                    according to this claim, cut out &quot;all the disagreeable part&quot;
                    of their kitchen work.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Another, in 1914, put a
                    quasi-patriotic slant on the peer pressure theme, claiming to have more than
                    700,000 users-now more than double the number in 1910 - and promoting the
                    cabinet as a &quot;<hi rend="i">national</hi> step saver for American
                    women.&quot; &quot;Women all over the <placeName>

                        &quot;woman-emancipator.&quot;<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Another, in
                    1920, claimed to be not just improving daily life for American housewives, but
                    revolutionizing the fate of &quot;Womankind,&quot; as evidenced by the
                    fact that kitchens were now being designed around the cabinet: &quot;To-day
                    kitchens are actually being <hi rend="i">planned</hi> to fit the
                        Hoosier.&quot;<hi rend="sup">43</hi> By 1920 the Hoosier Manufacturing
                    Company could point a metaphorical finger at the housewife and urge,

                    million other women.&quot;<hi rend="sup">44</hi></p>
                <p>Later ads shifted the focus from the reduction of drudgery to highlighting the
                    ways in which a Hoosier cabinet would transform the kitchen into a source of
                    delight, perfect for aiding the woman of the house to express lingering ideals
                    of supposed true womanhood. The McDougall cabinet promised to &quot;make
                    each kitchen hour a joy&quot; and claimed to &quot;radiate good

                    Company devised an ingenious way of gauging which ads generated the most
                    interest. As Philip Kennedy has pointed out, just as many companies today
                    include a department code on reader response cards, <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>. When readers sent in a form requesting information, the company
                    could identify the source of their interest by the address. One ad listed the
                    office at 1027 Broad Street, another at 1127 Sidney Street. Earlier ads gave
                    various numbers on Maple Street, while 1410 Sidney Street and 135 Calhoun Street
                    also made appearances. No doubt the post office in New Castle was aware of this
                    ploy and delivered all the mail to the actual location of the main office, on
                    South 14th Street.<hi rend="sup">52</hi></p>
                <p>Another innovative marketing device employed by the Hoosier Manufacturing Company
                    was its annual kitchen design competition that took place in the early 1920s.
                    Advertising in professional publications, the company solicited entries from
                    designers and architects around the country for kitchen layouts that would
                    incorporate a Hoosier cabinet in the most attractive and efficient way. In one
                    year, 343 entries were submitted, 50 of which made their way into the slender
                    published volume entitled <hi rend="i">The Kitchen Plan Book</hi>. Reprinted in
                    1997 by <hi rend="i">American Bungalow Magazine</hi>, this book is a valuable
                    resource for today&apos;s restorers and designers of early
                    twentieth-century-style kitchens. But when it was originally published, the book
                    was much more.</p>
                <p>&quot;The problem,&quot; as presented by the company, involved
                    &quot;the design of a fully equipped kitchen for a family of four or five
                    without a servant.&quot;<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Accordingly, the competition
                    rules specified that the kitchen could not exceed 144 square feet - these
                    kitchens were to be exemplars for the small, &quot;modern&quot; house
                    without a space-wasting pantry. Besides the Hoosier cabinet, the kitchen was to
                    include the &quot;essential requirements&quot; of a sink with drain
                    board, range, and refrigerator. The actual purpose of the competition, however,
                    becomes clear on reading the company&apos;s &quot;object.&quot;
                        <quote rend="blockquote">This competition is being conducted ... to
                        encourage the study by architects and architectural draftsmen of

                        small-family kitchen. The acuteness of the servant problem has resulted

                <p>By publishing the &quot;best&quot; work of the nation&apos;s
                    architects and designers, who had been challenged to incorporate a Hoosier
                    cabinet most effectively into a kitchen, the manufacturer was attempting no less
                    than a revision of basic kitchen standards. The book was intended not just to
                    show architects and builders how to plan a kitchen that would offer the most
                    effective layout for using a Hoosier kitchen cabinet; more ingeniously, the book
                    was intended to make the Hoosier cabinet as indispensable a part of the kitchen
                    as a stove or sink. Remember, the title of this book is not &quot;A Kitchen
                    Plan Book,&quot; but <hi rend="i">The Kitchen Plan Book</hi>. Ideally,
                    Americans would be left unable to imagine a kitchen that did not include a
                    Hoosier cabinet. What a quaint idea that would be! Of course a house must be
                    built with dedicated space for the Hoosier. No one in her right mind would wish
                    to go back to the time when a kitchen&apos;s storage and preparation areas
                    were limited to a &quot;mere built-in contrivance, such as a series of
                    shelves and cupboards.&quot;<hi rend="sup">55</hi> By the time of this
                    competition, &quot;[t]wo million women [had], by their purchases, placed the
                    stamp of approval on the Hoosier as <placeName>

                    text concluded with the following coup de grace: &quot;In planning a
                    kitchen, it is <hi rend="i">logical</hi> to leave a space in which the Hoosier
                    may be placed.&quot; And who would not wish to be logical in an era when the
                    values of &quot;science&quot; and &quot;system&quot; were so
                        vaunted?<hi rend="sup">57</hi></p>
                <p>Another significant factor in the Hoosier Manufacturing Company&apos;s
                    success was the company&apos;s masterly coordination of its advertising and
                    marketing schemes with a nationwide network of dealers. This collaboration made
                    the cabinets readily available to buyers even in rural locations many decades
                    before the development of general delivery services such as UPS. A 1915
                    publication for Hoosier retailers offers a brilliant example of the
                    company&apos;s dealer support. Published in broadsheet form, the <hi
                        rend="i">Hoosier Kitchen Cabinet Book</hi>, as this publication is called,
                    is, at just over thirty pages, actually less a book than a promotional guide for
                    retail agents. The booklet promised cash prizes for the highest-performing sales
                    agents, who could win up to $500 on top of their ordinary retail markup.

                    powerful incentive to sell the Hoosier Manufacturing Company&apos;s wares.)
                    The contest would coincide with a nationwide promotional event whereby customers
                    could purchase a Hoosier cabinet for $2.50 less than the advertised price. This
                    price reduction was especially significant given that the Hoosier Manufacturing
                    Company strictly controlled the prices charged by its authorized dealers.</p>
                <p>To encourage participation in this promotional extravaganza, the text cites past
                    successes: &quot;These sales have increased Hoosier business every year for
                    fifteen years in spite of wars, panics and periods of business depression. They
                    made the fall months of 1914 the biggest in Hoosier history. The new plan, we
                    believe, will increase your Hoosier business and your new customers beyond every
                    expectation you now think reasonable.<hi rend="sup">58</hi></p>
                <p>The booklet included guidance and materials for agents&apos; in-store use. It
                    previewed the advertisements that would appear in national publications such as

                        >Woman&apos;s Home Companion</hi>. It instructed sellers exactly how to
                    set up their store windows to maximize profits and offered special tags to
                    enhance their displays. Store Card No. 1, for instance, noted, &quot;PAY
                    ONLY $1. Balance $1 weekly.&quot;<hi rend="sup">59</hi> It offered dealers a

                <p>Furthermore, the booklet promised help with developing new customers by mail. In

                    personally to demonstrate the Hoosier cabinet to prospective buyers who came
                    into the store. One of the most entertaining passages describes &quot;Mrs.

                    unlimited number of balanced menus,&quot; which was provided as a standard
                    feature in the upper section of the higher-priced models. Retail salesmen were
                    urged to praise the Guide, which &quot;answers every day the perplexing

                            sophisticated development of all forms of sales. The Hoosier
                            Manufacturing Company encouraged its retail dealers to stay on the
                            cutting edge and sell their wares aggressively. In their <hi rend="i"

                            who would demonstrate their cabinets to prospective buyers.<lb/>

                    households. The cabinets&apos; penetration into the <placeName>

                    </placeName> market represented an unprecedented level of sales and reflected
                    the success of new methods of marketing and distribution. It is no wonder that
                    scholars use these companies&apos; advertisements to examine our
                    nation&apos;s transformation from a production-based economy to a culture
                    increasingly identified and defined by consumption.<hi rend="sup">62</hi></p>
                <p>The cabinet itself had been designed in response to a set of readily discernible
                    socio-economic needs, at a time that coincided fortuitously with the development
                    of the ancillary industrial infrastructure that allowed the various cabinet
                    companies to maximize sales. But while these manufacturers benefited by
                    underscoring the values of systematic planning and efficiency, along with the
                    desirability of the cabinet&apos;s sleek, modern style, other developments
                    in the realm of kitchen furnishings were taking place that epitomized these
                    qualities even more relentlessly.</p>
                <p>By the 1930s, the Hoosier cabinet had begun to be cast as outdated and was being
                    rapidly supplanted in American kitchens by built-in cabinets. Although built-ins
                    were advertised as <hi rend="i">the</hi> truly modern kitchen furniture, they
                    were by no means an innovation of the 1920s, but had been a common feature in
                    many nineteenth-century houses, particularly those of the wealthier classes.
                    Although the butler&apos;s pantry is the best-known example, more modest
                    homes often had linen presses recessed into their kitchen and dining room walls.

                    </placeName>, were also sometimes furnished with built-ins.</p>
                <p>These earlier cabinets were site - built into the fabric of a house by skilled
                    carpenters, usually during the home&apos;s construction. As such, they were
                    absolutely fixed in place and could not be removed if a family relocated to a
                    new home. (One Hoosier cabinet company, Kitchen Maid, had portrayed its
                    product&apos;s portability as an asset in a 1919 advertisement.)<hi
                        rend="sup">63</hi> Early built-ins were also relatively expensive, as they
                    required more refined carpentry than the basic construction and trimming out of
                    a house. As a result, they were uncommon among houses built for the working and
                    lower-middle classes.</p>
                <p>The manufacturers of freestanding kitchen cabinets had on more than one occasion
                    waged public relations campaigns against built-ins, which they recognized as a
                    potential threat in the market for middle-class kitchen <list type="footnotes">

                    contrasted the &quot;modern cabinet,&quot; which had been
                    &quot;scientifically developed for culinary purposes,&quot; with the
                    &quot;crudities of built-in shelves and cupboards.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                        >64</hi> To be sure, the Hoosier did exemplify many attributes of the modern
                    ethos, with its numerous mechanical parts, easy-to-clean surfaces, and
                    efficient, step-saving design. Yet when millwork companies marketed their new
                    modular built-ins, they found it easy to convince the housewife that their
                    designs took the best of the free-standing cabinets&apos;
                    &quot;modern&quot; qualities even further. Unlike the Hoosier, built-in
                    cabinets extended down to the floor, eliminating the space underneath where dust
                    and dirt could collect. The new built-ins could also be fitted seamlessly from
                    one wall to another and topped with a sanitary counter, further reducing
                    opportunities for grime to accumulate. Moreover, because they were available in
                    different widths and depths, the new built-ins could accurately be described as
                    even more efficient than freestanding cabinets, as they enabled landlords and
                    homeowners to maximize opportunities for storage in even the most irregular
                    spaces. They were also modern in the sense of being widely available to nearly
                    everyone, thanks to the very principles of efficiency and standardization that
                    the Hoosier Manufacturing Company had helped to pioneer. On top of all this, the
                    new built-ins had an indisputably more streamlined appearance than their
                    freestanding counterparts, which gave them the ultimate claim to being
                    &quot;modern.&quot;</p>
                <p>Several manufacturers of freestanding cabinets responded to the new kitchen
                    furnishing competition by differentiating their wares still further from what
                    some called &quot;mere built-in contrivances.&quot; They cut back on
                    claims highlighting functionality and focused instead on their
                    products&apos; aesthetic appeal and style. Colorfully painted Hoosier
                    cabinets became popular, their doors&apos; panels sometimes enhanced with
                    stenciled designs. A 1930 catalog published by the Hoosier Manufacturing
                    Company, for example, included cabinets in ivory, spring green, grey, orchid
                    pink, and citrus yellow, available with a decorative &quot;pipe
                    organ&quot; design on the upper cupboard doors. Kitchen Maid offered its
                    cabinets in &quot;beautiful Golden Oak and Snowy White Enamel.&quot;<hi
                        rend="sup">65</hi> The Sellers company attempted to bolster sales by
                    adopting designs traditionally associated with more formal types of furniture,
                    offering its basic Hoosier in a vaguely Mediterranean version with
                    &quot;gay, artistic effects of the Spanish type.&quot; Sellers also
                    advertised a quasi-Early American model characterized as
                    &quot;colonial,&quot; and a streamlined variation they called
                    &quot;Klear Front Modern American.&quot;<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Still

                    products - dishes, glassware, or other kitchen furniture such as stepstools,
                    breakfast sets, and worktables - at special prices with the purchase of a
                    cabinet. A Hoosier Manufacturing Company advertisement in 1931 offered a
                    &quot;complete Hoosier ensemble - 8 pieces $59.50 plus freight from
                    factory&quot;; in addition to a Hoosier cabinet, the set included a stool,

                <p>While each of these strategies may have boosted the manufacturers&apos;
                    flagging sales, they proved futile as long-term responses to the introduction of
                    modular built-ins. Several manufacturers, including Sellers, Hoosier, and
                    McDougall, eventually began producing their own lines of modular kitchen
                    cabinetry. As Jacquelyn Star points out, &quot;By 1935 free-standing kitchen
                    cabinets were considered old-fashioned. A reader from <placeName>

                    they raised two sons, Benjamin and Ewin. Carroll died in May 1891.</p>
                <p>In March 1863 Carroll purchased a small pocket diary bound in black leather. It
                    was divided into days, with eight lines of space for each entry. Carroll wrote
                    on the back of the righthand flyleaf: &quot;Wm H Carroll His Diary price 65
                    ct Bought March The 10 1863.&quot; His diary entries begin on Monday, March
                    16; they continue regularly through October 19 but then for the remainder of the
                    year, save for two entries on December 17 and 18, the record is empty.
                    Carroll&apos;s handwriting is clear, but he strove to fit every possible
                    word into his daily allotted space, and his hand sometimes grew miniscule,
                    pushed to the limits of the inside binding and the outside of the page, or
                    curved up or down at the end of an entry.</p>
                <p>Carroll&apos;s spelling is inventive and probably reflects his southern <placeName>

                    sees fellow soldiers &quot;wonded&quot; and &quot;kild.&quot;
                    Unfamiliar words change spelling as Carroll learns about the South -
                    &quot;byough&quot; becomes bayou, &quot;<placeName>

                <p>The little diary tells the story of only eight months of Carroll&apos;s long
                    war service, and it begins slowly, with the regiment in camp at <placeName>

                                        Empty square brackets indicate unclear or missing words or
                                        portions of words; letters within square brackets finish an
                                        otherwise unclear abbreviated word. Carroll&apos;s
                                        capitalization has been retained to the extent possible:
                                        some frequently capitalized letters, including R and W, are
                                        formed differently than the lower case; others, particularly
                                        the letter S, have fundamentally identical shapes whether
                                        lower or upper case, and the editors have made a best guess
                                        according to context, previous spelling of the word, and
                                        comparative size. Carroll&apos;s original prose often
                                        did not include standard punctuation, no doubt because of
                                        the shortness of each entry. In many entries, it is
                                        difficult to distinguish between punctuation and frequent
                                        pen marks, and so the editors have chosen to eliminate
                                        punctuation altogether. Above each entry we have used a
                                        version of the diary&apos;s own titles for each

                                        The 24th Indiana, led by Alvin Hovey and William Spicely,
                                        was one of the regiments which first met the Confederate
                                        line. More than three hours of intense fighting ensued
                                        before they were relieved by other regiments and could fall
                                        back. Gen. McGinnis called the battle &quot;one of the
                                        most obstinate and murderous conflicts of the war&quot;;
                                        Spicely wrote of a &quot;desperate and
                                        destructive&quot; struggle &quot;under the most
                                        galling fire I ever witnessed.&quot; The Confederate
                                        line was finally broken and the defeated troops retreated to <placeName>

                                        </placeName>. Union losses were heavy: the 24th Indiana,
                                        from a force of about 500 men, suffered 207 killed and
                                        wounded in that single day. Carroll was among the wounded,
                                        as he notes in his diary, and his health continued to be an
                                        issue in the weeks and months afterward. See report of Brig.

                                            &quot;For more than forty days they were under
                                            constant fire, casualties happening daily in the midst
                                            of their camps; men were killed and wounded in their
                                            beds, at the table, in the rifle-pits, and yet, during
                                            all this long period, there was no murmur, no complaint.
                                            They were veterans and determined to succeed.&quot;

                    into law and politics, running for local office as a Republican. He married in
                    1859, and in May 1861 his first child was born. The following fall, Wood began
                    recruiting a company for the 48th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He began
                    as a captain in charge of a company and over time became the commanding colonel
                    of the 48th. The letters cover the period from January 16, 1862, to February 27,
                    1865, during which Wood participated in such battles as Corinth and Champion

                    accounts of other aspects of military life. Wood is especially thorough in his
                    descriptions of camp accommodations, the movement of men and their baggage, and
                    diet and the procurement of food. His training in law and engineering was put to
                    good use as he found himself, at various times, put in charge of road and bridge
                    construction, detailed to serve as a court-martial judge, and assigned to the
                    office of provost marshal. (His account of his actions as provost of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2040656" reg="Paducah">Paducah</settlement>
                    </placeName> is especially informative.) Wood&apos;s letters also nicely
                    describe sundry other aspects of camp life, from picket duty to a fishing picnic
                    with other officers. Among their most unusual passages are those dealing with
                    Wood&apos;s efforts to gain information about his southern relatives and
                    find ways to communicate with them. A particularly poignant entry juxtaposes
                    Wood&apos;s hard hand-of-war values with his awareness of what his Dixie
                    loved ones are suffering at the hands of Union troops.</p>
                <p>Oddly enough, Wood, an abolitionist, writes little about the slavery issue, and
                    what little he has to say about blacks is sometimes insensitive. Concepts such
                    as order and duty seem more central than slavery to Wood&apos;s
                    understanding of the war and his role in it. It also seems odd that Wood, who
                    ran for office in <placeName>

                    </placeName> both before and after the war, has so little to say about Hoosier
                    politics. In fact, Wood does not appear to have closely identified with his
                    adopted state, and he talks of Hoosiers in the third person as if he were not
                    one of them. His wife left <placeName>

                <p>Beyond war and politics, Wood&apos;s letters also provide some insights into
                    the values and domestic life of a northern, urban middle-class family. There are
                    numerous expressions of Christian fatalism, advice on child-rearing, and career
                    concerns. Also common are passages articulating the affections and the longings
                    for reunion of a man long separated from wife and daughter. Finally, a number of
                    passages deal with Wood&apos;s literary tastes and the titles of fictional
                    works that he was reading.</p>

                    &quot;nonmetropolitan&quot; areas but gradually left them for cities.
                    Northern migration, Blocker writes, reflected the &quot;mental
                    maps&quot; that black migrants carried with them - personal images that
                    reflected their interests. Their quality of life in the Midwest depended on
                    local economies, the attitudes and actions of whites, and the conditions within
                    each black community. While violence between 1885 and 1910 shaped migration
                    patterns, population decline in the region&apos;s towns was slow and
                    steady.</p>

                    migration before 1890. Part two (1860-1910) examines conditions that migrants
                    found and how they coped with them. The last section explores (mostly after
                    1910) &quot;the choices made by migrants before leaving the South as well as
                    those that brought them to some destinations rather than others in the Lower
                    Midwest&quot; (p. 12).</p>
                <p>While providing a wealth of material and analysis - including twenty graphs and
                    thirty-five tables - and demonstrating wide reading in primary and secondary
                    sources, the author disappoints the reader. Information is difficult to digest,
                    partly because of the author&apos;s writing style. Unexplained statistical
                    jargon (for example, in the two tables on pp. 79-80) reinforces the impression
                    that the author is addressing a specialized audience. Language issues persist
                    throughout the volume. The writer never defines &quot;metropolitan&quot;
                    - the reader must assume that this is the federal census term introduced in 1910
                    - and uses such terms as rural, village, town, small city, and non-metropolitan
                    interchangeably. He calls these decades &quot;the age of the
                    village&quot; (p. 214), yet all of the places he describes had at least
                    2,500 residents, and hence by census terminology were urban.</p>
                <p>Factual and interpretive errors appear too frequently - for example, the
                    locations and dates of <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio
                        River</geogName> bridges (p. 23), the account of the election of blacks to

                    telling was the growth of Jim Crow policies - for example, the creation of
                    restrictive covenants in real estate transactions. Most settlements along both

                <p>In the early 1900s, Meredith Nicholson was a household name, not just in <placeName>

                    Tarkington, and George Ade. Now, a century later, Nicholson&apos;s name is
                    barely recognized - a fact that Ralph D. Gray has sought to remedy with his
                    biography, <hi rend="i">Meredith Nicholson: A Writing Life</hi>.</p>
                <p>Gray, professor emeritus of history at Indiana University-Purdue University
                    Indianapolis, is best known for his scholarship on the history of transportation
                    and the history of <placeName>

                    examinations of Nicholson. He also recently collected his favorite examples of
                    Nicholson&apos;s essays and articles in <hi rend="i">A Meredith Nicholson
                        Reader</hi> (2007). Here, however, in what is, surprisingly, the first full
                    biography of the author&apos;s life, Gray provides a meticulously
                    researched, richly detailed history of Nicholson&apos;s life as both author
                    and diplomat.</p>
                <p>Seven chapters chronicle the development of Nicholson from ninth-grade dropout
                    into newspaper and magazine journalist, poet, state historian, novelist,
                    essayist, and (in one unsuccessful attempt) playwright. While romantic adventure
                    novels dominated Nicholson&apos;s tremendous output of 29 books, Gray
                    asserts in the introduction that &quot;his finest writing, and his most

                    (1913), which Gray considers to be Nicholson&apos;s &quot;most
                    significant&quot; and probably best novel, as well as his first venture into
                    realism.</p>
                <p>Three other chapters chronicle Nicholson&apos;s political career, beginning
                    in the 1920s with a chaotic and transformative decade of his life that other
                    biographers have failed to address. Gray effectively captures
                    Nicholson&apos;s fading glory as novelist - unable to successfully navigate
                    the shift in readers&apos; and critics&apos; tastes from romantic to
                    realistic fiction - and his rising reputation as a statesman and as a political
                    and social writer. These new roles brought their own difficulties: Along with an
                    unsuccessful bid for the state senate, Nicholson was one of <placeName>

                    period of his life ended with the death of his wife Eugenie, but he soon
                    remarried and entered eight years of diplomatic service in <placeName>

                    Nicholson tries to reestablish a home and a writing career in his beloved <placeName>

                    </placeName>, despite loneliness and a collapsing marriage. Yet Gray asserts the
                    import of Nicholson&apos;s stature and reputation in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"

                <p>While the book&apos;s subject matter may seem to be of interest only to
                    students of <placeName>

                    </placeName> literature and history, its significance as the first - and
                    undoubtedly only - biography of this once major American author and public
                    figure is not to be overlooked. Nor is Gray&apos;s expert handling of his
                    subject matter. He avoids the common tendency to divide Nicholson&apos;s
                    life into two distinct halves, as writer and statesman. Rather, as
                    Gray&apos;s subtitle <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-105-1-094"/>makes clear, he
                    unifies the <hi rend="i">whole</hi> of Nicholson&apos;s career into
                    &quot;a writing life.&quot; The result is a coherent, compelling study
                    with only minor shortcomings: a few instances of unwieldy prose that is
                    otherwise is clear and elegant, and, in discussion of events spanning 1938 to
                    1943, a few confusing shifts in chronology. Such lapses are negligible, however,
                    in light of the book&apos;s sizable contributions to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"

                <p>As Gray recalls in his final chapter, the <hi rend="i">New York Times</hi> called

                    shifting literary winds of the last century, Nicholson&apos;s place on that
                    tree will remain secure.</p>

                <p>In this latest volume of the <hi rend="i">Steel Shavings</hi> series - a social

                    </placeName> - historian James B. Lane has again woven together a
                    thought-provoking, often entertaining, and at times tragic collection of oral
                    histories and recollections from Vietnam veterans. The series first featured the
                    stirring voices of local Vietnam veterans in 1988, when history students at
                    Indiana University Northwest compiled oral interviews in conjunction with
                    Professor Lane&apos;s course on the war. At a time when Reagan-era
                    revisionists were attempting to recast the Vietnam conflict as a noble and
                    winnable endeavor, Lane and his students intended to reinforce the real
                    &quot;lessons of Vietnam&quot; - from the hazards of misunderstanding
                    vital national interest to the absence of a clearly defined exit strategy - by
                    using the reminiscences of the working-class men and women who paid for those
                    mistakes in southeast Asia. Now, twenty years later, with the <placeName>

                    </placeName> again groping for answers in another unconventional war,
                    Lane&apos;s students have gathered together another album of visceral
                    testimony in the hopes of revisiting many of those apparently still unheeded
                    lessons of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>As one soldier explains, every veteran has his own story; no two are the same.
                    Indeed the real value of this <hi rend="i">Steel Shavings</hi> volume rests in
                    the <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-105-1-095"/>richness and multiplicity of perspectives
                    from these soldiers, many of whom are drawing on lives well-lived, and
                    not-so-well-lived, to make sense of their distinctive place in the Vietnam
                    experience. More than fifty IUN students conducted the loosely structured oral
                    histories around such themes as how veterans found themselves in <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viêt Nam">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>, how they experienced life &quot;in country&quot; and upon
                    return to &quot;the world,&quot; and how they assess the impact of
                    Vietnam on their lives.</p>
                <p>A certain stoicism, often fatalism, emerges from these pages, as many veterans
                    from this steel mill region of <placeName>

                    </placeName> that sent a disproportionate number of its sons to <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viêt Nam">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> recall their decision to enlist, instead of waiting to be drafted,
                    and their curious baptism into the surreal logic of war. For some, <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viêt Nam">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> was a land of fantastic flora and fauna: elephants and elephant
                    grass, tigers, leeches, mosquitoes, and lizards whose cries sounded remarkably
                    like obscenities. Others evoke the unforgettable smells of the war-sweat,
                    gunpowder, diesel fuel, rain, and the sickeningly sweet stench of death. Nearly
                    all work to articulate in some haunting way the raw emotions of human suffering
                    and the senseless waste of young lives both interrupted and too often cut short.
                    Not surprisingly, strong feelings of mistrust and cynicism - toward the
                    government in general and military adventurism more specifically - permeate
                    these pages, as does a pronounced aversion to the idea of sending their own sons
                    to be exploited in undeclared wars. In addition to the powerful oral histories,
                    Lane wisely includes other primary source materials, including selections from
                    contemporary newspaper columns and sundry letters, diaries, poems, memoirs, and
                    photographs, to further establish the authentic look and feel of the Vietnam
                    era. In fact, the volume&apos;s most provocative passages are those excerpts
                    from L.T. Wolf&apos;s <hi rend="i">Soldier&apos;s Viet-nam</hi> (1996)
                    and Joe Klein&apos;s fine book <hi rend="i">Payback: Five Marines After
                        Vietnam</hi> (1984) about the heartrending odyssey of a veteran named Gary
                    Cooper.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, as the bloodshed and horror of Vietnam increasingly fade from our
                    collective consciousness, the memories included in this volume of <hi rend="i"
                        >Steel Shavings</hi> realize Lane&apos;s aim of reiterating the harsh
                    lessons of what George Kennan judged the most disastrous of all American
                    undertakings. In doing so, he and his students capture the simple dignity of
                    these unheralded Vietnam veterans who, in serving their country, often
                    &quot;walked the line between heroism and cowardice, proud but with few
                    illusions&quot; (p. 112).</p>

                <p>At the outset of the 1968 campaign, Robert Kennedy remarked that he was the only
                    serious candidate ever to run for President opposed by business, organized
                    labor, and his own party&apos;s leadership. That was certainly the case
                    during the Indiana primary, the first contest on the calendar for Kennedy after
                    his late entry into that tumultuous year&apos;s fateful presidential race.

                    stand-in for the soon-to-be lame duck President Lyndon Johnson. He also
                    confronted <hi rend="i">The Indianapolis Star</hi>, which attacked Kennedy on

                    attitude,&quot; wrote native Hoosier reporter and campaign advisor John
                    Bartlow Martin in a memo to Kennedy. George Wallace had carried almost one-third
                    of the Indiana Democratic primary vote just four years earlier. To win, Kennedy
                    needed to mold together a new coalition of voters comprising what syndicated
                    columnist Joseph Kraft called &quot;Black Power and Backlash.&quot;</p>
                <p>Kennedy&apos;s highly visible work on civil rights issues as Attorney General
                    and U.S. Senator had already earned him strong loyalty among the
                    state&apos;s African American population. But it was Kennedy&apos;s
                    &quot;mysterious chemistry with lower classes,&quot; as reporter and
                    former Kennedy adviser Jack Newfield called it, that allowed him to make
                    critical inroads among the state&apos;s white blue-collar workers and family
                    farmers. These voters - Slavs, Poles, Italians, and Irish as well as
                    &quot;rednecks&quot; up from <placeName>

                    of the youth vote by courting voters in college communities. So it was that
                    Kennedy came to be the first political leader in the late 1960s to try to bring
                    together an <placeName>

                    and an unpopular war.</p>
                <p>Most fascinating is Boomhower&apos;s description of how the Kennedy campaign
                    adjusted itself to the Hoosier state&apos;s conservative style and pace.
                    Kennedy began to limit the more frenetic campaign events, although his celebrity
                    made such an effort difficult as spectators would literally grab for a piece of
                    him during campaign appearances, coming away with strands of clothing and locks
                    of hair. Martin had encouraged Kennedy to make campaign visits to the
                    state&apos;s historic sites to demonstrate his understanding of
                    &quot;Hoosier pride.&quot; He also pressed Kennedy to visit the backlash
                    factory towns in central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName>, followed by a whistle-stop railroad trip on the famous Wabash
                    Cannonball.</p>
                <p>Kennedy also toned down his message, emphasizing his tough law-and-order
                    background and his support of policies to move people from welfare to work.
                    Kennedy strongly believed his message of &quot;self reliance&quot; and
                    &quot;community action&quot; to fight poverty as an alternative to big
                    government programs, and he delivered it to black and white audiences alike,
                    although many liberals cringed. By turns, he charmed and challenged his
                    audiences, calling on voters to take personal responsibility for making <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                    </placeName> better. Hoosiers came to Kennedy skeptically, but they found unique
                    honesty and authenticity.</p>
                <p>The best remembered moment from Kennedy&apos;s 1968 Indiana primary campaign
                    is, of course, is his visit to an <placeName>

                    of Martin Luther King Jr.&apos;s assassination just minutes before.
                    Boomhower begins his book with a recounting of that day - April 4, 1968 - and a
                    reiteration of the spontaneous words by Kennedy that not only quelled a riot but
                    still stand as one of the most moving campaign speeches in American political
                    history.</p>
                <p>Robert Kennedy&apos;s 1968 campaign has been called the &quot;last good
                    campaign,&quot; a moniker with which the supporters of Barack Obama might
                    now quarrel. Like Obama, Kennedy launched his campaign with the promise to bring
                    together an <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                    </placeName> divided by an unpopular war. And, like Obama, Kennedy sought to
                    practice a new kind of politics in which ordinary citizens could shape their own
                    and their country&apos;s destiny and to push Americans to pursue a higher
                    purpose than mere accumulation of wealth. This book is a must-read for anyone
                    interested in presidential politics.</p>

                    help fellow Muslims perfect their practice of Islam. Chosen for its central

                    </placeName> becomes the destination of choice for Khadra&apos;s sincere,
                    mission-minded parents. Intent on instilling the &quot;Islamic
                    Lifestyle&quot; among wayward Muslims, Khadra&apos;s parents have no
                    compunctions about policing the religious behavior of their friends. Khadra is
                    nurtured by a tight-knit, cosmopolitan community of Muslim aunties and uncles,
                    comprising African Americans, Arabs, South Asians, and Cambodians. In spite of
                    the social cement provided by Islam, the community is marked by sectarian
                    tensions between Sunnis and Shias, the racial prejudices of Arab members against
                    their African and African American cohorts, and differences in economic
                    status.</p>
                <p>Through her protagonist, Kahf explores the complications and contradictions of
                    identity at a number of different levels, asking what it means to be Muslim, a
                    Muslim feminist, an Arab, a Hoosier, and an American. As the novel progresses,
                    Khadra sheds her simplistic understanding of each of these identities and gains
                    a more complex one. During her sojourn in <placeName>

                    </placeName> following her divorce, she has an epiphany regarding Sufism, an
                    experience that challenges the religious orthodoxy of her youth and helps to
                    solidify her burgeoning feminism. She acquires a real knowledge of
                    multiculturalism on the same trip through her interactions with Syrian Jews and
                    her recognition of their claims to an authentic Syrian identity. After returning

                    </placeName> and to pursue a degree in photography. Her conception of Islam
                    expands to incorporate a wide range of practices. Yet, as Kahf revealed in a
                    recent radio interview, prayer constitutes the &quot;secret embedded
                    structure of the novel&quot; (www.whhb.org/news/newstopics.php?tid=3). One
                    of her goals was to represent material practices of Islam such as qiyam, ruku,
                    sajda, and juloos (each term describes a specific bodily posture and spiritual
                    stage during the ritual of prayer). Another aim was to convey the texture of
                    Muslim material culture by evoking memories of the fashion for Kuwaiti tie-back
                    head scarves and black <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-105-1-099"/> velvet pictures of
                    Kaba that were popular in the seventies.</p>
                <p>For Khadra, changes in her Islamic consciousness necessarily entail realigning
                    her understanding of American identity. She begins to see parallels between the
                    experiences of her community and those of other religious minorities,
                    particularly Mormons, Catholics, and Jews. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> becomes visible as a religious mosaic populated by the Amish,
                    Native Americans, Presbyterians and Quakers; the charming Mrs. Moore (a literary
                    reference to E.M. Forster), for example, is a Friend who speaks a smattering of
                    Arabic and regularly contributes her rhubarb pies to the Muslim
                    community&apos;s celebrations. Indeed, by the end of the novel Khadra has
                    another epiphany regarding parallels between Muslims and Midwesterners:
                    &quot;Hoosiers - set in their ways, hardworking, steady, valuing God and
                    family ... they&apos;re us, and we&apos;re them. Hah! My folks are the
                    perfect <hi rend="i">Hoosiers</hi>!&quot; (p. 438).</p>
                <p>Kahf also successfully decenters dominant American narratives about geopolitics
                    by describing Arab perceptions and reactions to an all-too muscular and imperial
                    foreign policy. The characters express horror at the Sabra and Shatila
                    massacres, cheer the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, avidly follow the first
                    Intifada, experience outrage at Syrian Baathist attempts to strip women of
                    hijab, and mourn the aerial bombings of <placeName>

                    </placeName> with their attendant massive civilian casualties. A worthy addition
                    to the emergent canon of ethnic literature, the novel importantly challenges
                    readers to adopt a more international perspective. However, occasional
                    colloquialisms, along with the earnest didacticism of some passages, mar the
                    novel&apos;s otherwise lyrical prose.</p>

                <p>This brave little book, originally published in 1977, attempts a survey of the
                    culture and history of the eighteenth-century Shawnee, the tribe most associated
                    with contesting the white settlement of the Old Northwest. Despite their
                    importance, the Shawnee had then attracted few serious <pb n="92"
                        id="VAA4025-105-1-100"/>scholars, and most of the literature was
                    superficial, vague, and inaccurate. The best published research, by such
                    pioneers as Erminie Wheeler Voegelin and Charles Hanna, treated only limited
                    aspects of what was a large, complicated, and legendary field. Undeterred, Jerry
                    E. Clark offered an introduction remarkable for its breadth, tackling issues as
                    diverse as musical styles, folklore, migration, technology, and inter-tribal
                    relations. Fishing such murky waters, the book does not entirely succeed but
                    still repays study.</p>
                <p>The author, an anthropologist, is weakest on the straight history, and there are
                    misleading errors. We are told that <placeName>

                    </placeName> was &quot;the only territory&quot; the Shawnee
                    &quot;could possibly consider as a homeland&quot; (p. 94), a statement
                    incompatible with the fact that the tribe established hardly any substantial
                    villages there (Eskippakithiki being an unusual exception) but some forty
                    further north in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, which some Shawnees declared to be an ancestral home. Even more
                    jarring is the assertion that &quot;Tecumseh gathered a force from several
                    tribes and made raids on the <placeName>

                    </placeName>&quot; (pp. 92-3), which attributes hostilities that occurred in
                    1782, when Tecumseh was a boy, to a movement he would launch after 1806! Readers
                    wanting a surer-footed introduction to the crucial role the tribe played between
                    1740 and 1820 are better served by Colin Calloway&apos;s <hi rend="i">The
                        Shawnees and the War for <placeName>
                            <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                        </placeName></hi> (2007). Clark is stronger when he deals with the
                    fragmentation of the tribe in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries,
                    for which he draws upon his doctoral dissertation on Shawnee migration. His
                    outline of the confusing movements of Shawnees at that time, the motives that
                    impelled them, and the relationships they formed with different Indian and white
                    communities is useful and thoughtful.</p>
                <p>Clark is more comfortable reconstructing the culture of the Shawnees, and his
                    discussion ranges widely and intelligently. His view that the tribe was
                    characteristically conservative, despite extensive interaction with other
                    peoples and a growing dependency upon European manufactures, is worthy of more
                    detailed investigation. But even here the sources are often more treacherous
                    than Clark suspects. Some contemporaries, such as John Johnston, sometime <placeName>

                    </placeName> Indian agent to the Shawnee, colored accounts of Shawnee life with
                    observations actually made of other tribes, while most modern historians have
                    overly furnished theirs from descriptions of Shawnee society as it existed in
                    the late nineteenth or twentieth centuries, as if it had not just passed through
                    the most radical period of cultural change in its known history. Among many
                    wearisome anachronisms projected into the past by such historians is confusion
                    about the five different divisions of Shawnee in the eighteenth century. Here,
                    Clark errs in stating that the tribal chieftainship <pb n="93"
                        id="VAA4025-105-1-101"/>of the Shawnee was a prerogative of the Chillicothe
                    division (p. 33). It was actually exercised by the Mekoche division, and the
                    famous civil chief Black Hoof was not a Chillicothe (p. 16), but a volubly
                    patriotic Mekoche. Divisional differences in practices also make generalizations
                    about the Shawnee as a whole difficult. Thus what Clark calls &quot;the
                    Shawnee myth of origin&quot; (p. 52), involving a voyage over water, was
                    actually a Chillicothe rather than a &quot;tribal&quot; myth, and the
                    Mekoches had a very different account of their origins.</p>
                <p>Our picture of the authentic eighteenth-century Shawnees is still blurred and
                    fragmentary, but archaeological research and newly discovered documentary
                    sources are slowly sharpening the image. It is a pity that the University Press
                    of Kentucky did not give Clark an opportunity to revise his book, and weigh
                    recent research. As it is, it needs to be used cautiously. Nevertheless, its
                    comprehensiveness makes it an excellent starting point for any investigation of

                <p>Planning for the Lewis and Clark expedition began in early 1803. The expedition
                    itself lasted from 1803 to 1806. Planning for the commemoration of the
                    expedition&apos;s bicentennial began some ten years before the actual
                    January 2003 opening ceremonies. The expedition involved thousands of people in
                    its planning, administration, and execution. The bicentennial involved millions,
                    from those who worked in its planning stages to those who attended events on
                    local, state, and national levels. Contemporary media coverage of the expedition
                    was scant, and published accounts were relatively few. Not so for the
                    bicentennial. The sum total of all the related events, publications, films,
                    products, etc., easily numbered in the thousands. Some bicentennial efforts were
                    better than others and made a more lasting contribution to the Lewis and Clark
                    legacy. From the <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-105-1-102"/>beginning of planning,
                    organizers committed to having meaningful Native American input and involvement.
                    Working with those tribes whose ancestors made the success of the expedition
                    possible, they saw the bicentennial as an opportunity to tell the Indian side of
                    the Lewis and Clark story and also to address the issues and challenges faced
                    today by the descendants of those native peoples whom the Corps of Discovery
                    encountered.</p>
                <p>This effort was largely successful. Significant Native American participation in
                    the bicentennial led to some of the most important results of the entire
                    commemoration. The Newberry Library&apos;s exhibition, &quot;Lewis and
                    Clark and the Indian Country,&quot; looked not only at the Corps&apos;
                    interactions with native peoples but at its impact in the years that followed.
                    Lewis and Clark were the leading edge of a people and a government that would
                    sweep across the American West and permanently change the lives and cultures of
                    its native peoples.</p>

                        Country: The Native American Perspective</hi>. Using sources from the time

                    Native American culture and affairs. Journal entries written by expedition
                    members about their encounters with the native peoples; Native American creation
                    myths and other stories; accounts of the impact of reservations, cattle herding,
                    and the damming of the <geogName key="tgn_7014086" reg="Missouri River"
                        >Missouri</geogName> upon Indian life; and narratives of efforts to save
                    such aspects of traditional culture as language, fishing, and crafts are just
                    some of the many subjects in this enlightening and interesting book. As
                    contributor James Ronda makes clear, both the Corps of Discovery and the native
                    peoples they encountered were explorers. Ronda&apos;s conclusion provides
                    some &quot;sobering thoughts&quot; on the Lewis and Clark story, the
                    bicentennial, and the lessons offered by both (pp. 343-52).</p>

                    </placeName> - from the 1780s through the 1820s. The trans-Appalachian frontier
                    in these decades, he argues, was for Catholics a &quot;contested
                    space&quot; - a place where they encountered an almost bewildering variety
                    of Protestants on more or less equal terms. If Catholics were still a numerical
                    minority and handicapped by poverty, they could draw on the resources of a rich
                    devotional tradition that was rendered the more evocative by the circumstances
                    of frontier privation. They also enjoyed the services of some remarkable priests
                    - men who aspired to communal as well as religious leadership. As a result,
                    frontier Catholics, and especially their clergy, were more apt than their East
                    Coast confreres to be optimists with regard to the future of American
                    Catholicism and confident in their own standing as citizens.</p>
                <p>At the same time, frontier life posed serious obstacles to Catholicism&apos;s
                    flourishing. Even where they tried to settle together, Catholics in the
                    trans-Appalachian West almost invariably had Protestant neighbors. An acute
                    shortage of priests and money retarded the development of conventional parish
                    life. Frontier mobility undermined efforts to build community, while frontier
                    isolation increased the likelihood of religious intermarriage. Particularly in
                    the early <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-105-1-104"/>years of settlement, moreover, that
                    same isolation made it hard for a distant bishop to discipline his priests,
                    which resulted in an unusually large number of clerical scandals in the region,
                    generally centered on money and factional infighting. Sexual scandals seem to
                    have been less common, at least according to the surviving record. But scandals
                    of any variety were damaging not just to Catholic morale but to prospects for
                    inter-religious harmony.</p>
                <p>Dichtl&apos;s narrative departs from most previous accounts of Catholicism in
                    the early Republic in its marked absence of triumphalism. Although he duly notes
                    the institution-building achievements of these decades, some of which were
                    impressive, he is far more interested in the encounter between Catholics and
                    non-Catholics. A rough sort of ecumenism does seem to have prevailed in the
                    early years of frontier settlement. Catholic schools were among the first
                    educational institutions to be established in the trans-Appalachian West and
                    were typically patronized by Protestants as well as Catholics. Protestants often
                    contributed to Catholic church-building funds, motivated partly by a hunger for
                    social stability and partly by boosterism. Catholic preaching of even the most
                    vigorously apologetic variety usually drew crowds, given the loneliness and
                    tedium of frontier existence, as did Catholic devotional processions. There were
                    occasional conversions, too, which figured prominently in period Catholic
                    mythology.</p>
                <p>In the 1820s, however, growing Catholic numbers and continued achievement on the
                    institutional front led to increasing religious polarization. For many
                    evangelical Protestants, Catholic success in the trans-Appalachian West - no
                    matter how modest its actual dimensions - threatened to erode the
                    nation&apos;s Protestant identity. By the 1830s, what Ray Allen Billington
                    has famously called &quot;the Protestant crusade&quot; was well
                    underway, stoked in subsequent years by greatly accelerated Catholic
                    immigration. American Catholics responded by turning inward, their lives more
                    and more defined by exclusively Catholic institutions and distinctive religious
                    practices derived from European devotional traditions.</p>
                <p>Dichtl is especially to be commended for exploring an under-researched period and
                    locale in American Catholic history. He has done a fine job of interrogating
                    sources that come mostly from clerical hands. I particularly admired his
                    analysis of Catholic material culture in a frontier context. His book is a
                    welcome addition to American Catholic historiography.</p>

                <p>The University of Missouri Press is to be commended for republishing Charles van
                    Ravenswaay&apos;s magnum opus, an exhaustive and lavishly illustrated

                    another generation of readers with access to a true classic, a handsome volume
                    that belongs on the shelf of historians, folklorists, and Germanophiles, as well
                    as anyone concerned with German immigration to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> An informative and touching introduction by Adolf Shroeder, van

                    settlements in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, is a welcome addition to this revised edition.
                    Schroeder&apos;s richly detailed biographical sketch does a fine job of
                    placing the work in context and provides the reader with an overview of the
                    author&apos;s life and accomplishments. Schroeder rightly credits the first
                    publication of van Ravenswaay&apos;s work in 1977 with a revival of interest
                    in German cultural traditions, festivals, history, and sister-city agreements in
                    the German-settled region of <placeName>

                <p>The book is divided into three parts. Part I, &quot;The Great
                    Migration&quot; (chapters 1-4), provides a contextual framework within which
                    to view the German immigration to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the nineteenth century, based largely on a review of secondary
                    sources. Part II, &quot;Buildings&quot; (chapters 5-11), surveys extant
                    examples of folk architecture built by German immigrants who settled along the
                        <geogName key="tgn_7014086" reg="Missouri River">Missouri River</geogName>
                    between <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the region with which the book is most concerned. This section of
                    the book is an exhaustive accounting of such artifacts, and includes hundreds of
                    photographs, sketches, and floor plans. While most such surveys are organized
                    according to architectural form and style, van Ravenswaay organizes this section
                    by construction material (log, frame, stone and brick), which unfortunately does
                    not as easily allow comparisons across time and space. Part III,
                    &quot;Objects for Domestic Use&quot; (chapters 12-23), surveys extant
                    examples of domestic objects such as furniture (cupboards, benches, pie safes,
                    tables, chairs, chests), musical instruments, baskets, firearms, textiles,
                    pottery, and drawings and prints that were either brought with the immigrants
                    from <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7000084" reg="Deutschland">Germany</country>

                    </placeName>. This section is also stunningly comprehensive in scope and
                    likewise is accompanied by literally hundreds of photographs and drawings of
                    these objects.</p>
                <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-105-1-106"/>
                <p>Academically, the book should be seen as a product of its time and judged by what
                    it is - a largely descriptive survey, massive in its scope and remarkable in its
                    attention to detail, that remains the most impressive record of the material
                    artifacts associated with nineteenth-century German immigrants - rather than by
                    what it is not. The book&apos;s main drawback is a lack of significant
                    context that ties the subject matter (folk culture artifacts) to any
                    national-scale patterns or processes. The work tells us very little about the
                    people who made or possessed these objects - class, social ideals, and
                    economies, for example, are concepts almost wholly outside of its purview. Much
                    of the author&apos;s discussion of the history of German immigration to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007523" reg="Missouri">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> is unfortunately outdated and is preoccupied with the role of
                    various organized settlement ventures and societies. A plethora of highly
                    detailed studies of individual immigrant communities in the Midwest written in
                    the 1980s and 1990s, which traced immigrants back to sending regions in Europe,
                    have provided a much richer and fuller understanding of the nature of German
                    immigration in the nineteenth century, focusing on the role of chain migration
                    and the role of class in the trans-Atlantic migration. But in the end these
                    shortcomings distract little from the overall value of this stunning and
                    beautiful piece of scholarship. Viewed within the context of the
                    author&apos;s main goals (to catalog and survey folk artifacts) and of the
                    period in which it was written, it remains a true classic even thirty years
                    after its initial publication.</p>

                <p>The global capitalist supremacy that accompanied the thaw of the Cold War left
                    the American labor movement unable to articulate alternatives to a system that
                    continued to destroy communities, devastate the environment, and increase the
                    distance between the haves and the have-nots. So reads the usual academic
                    assessment of the state of American labor in the twenty-first century - a view
                    with roots that reach back to the supposedly lean, lost decades that surrounded
                    the First World War.</p>
                <p>Rosemary Feurer acknowledges the dim outlook for labor in the new millennium, but
                    she is not so pessimistic in her appraisal of when or <pb n="99"
                        id="VAA4025-105-1-107"/>how the trouble began. This is because she frames
                    her analysis more broadly than the traditional labor history of great leaders
                    stirring militancy on the shop floor to overcome the hegemony of large,
                    multi-plant corporations. Her view extends to &quot;labor&apos;s
                    periphery,&quot; where a &quot;militant minority endeavored to weld
                    their workmates and neighbors into a self-aware and purposeful working
                    class&quot; (p. 236). This widened gaze - encompassing both workplace and
                    community - allows her to note the substantive social change that seemed
                    possible when workers confronted corporate power on the job and worked to
                    transform their local community and the nation.</p>
                <p> Feurer labels this recognition of the union as both labor organization and civic
                    organization &quot;radical unionism,&quot; and locates its embodiment in
                    District 8 of the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America, a
                    cluster of local unions stretching across six midwestern states. Based in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014444" reg="Saint Louis">St.
                            Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, District 8 emerged in 1936 alongside a number of grassroots
                    organizations with Communist ties. Under the leadership of Communist William
                    Sentner, the 50,000 members of District 8 drew upon the city&apos;s rich
                    leftist labor heritage and combined it with a strong civic consciousness to
                    become &quot;one of the most democratic organizations of working-class life
                    in the Midwest&quot; (p. 223). Feurer carefully narrates the development of
                    Sentner&apos;s personal philosophy of &quot;human rights above property
                    rights,&quot; (p. 72) and its evolution into a union philosophy to
                    &quot;link workers&apos; struggle with community-based
                    mobilizations&quot; (p. 43). From his early 1930s experiences organizing
                    black female workers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014444" reg="Saint Louis">St.

                    </placeName> nut-shelling sweatshops, Sentner recognized that community was
                    vital if a union was to act as a movement for social transformation. He and
                    other district organizers tapped into networks of communal support in a plan to
                    overcome anti-union bosses in electrical manufacturing plants in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. They addressed housing issues, allied with clergy, challenged
                    racist cultural practices, confronted gender inequalities, and developed youth
                    programs. The multi-city, multi-firm comparative method that Feurer employs to
                    tell these stories reveals the importance of cross-plant solidarity - strikes at
                    some shops helped stimulate organizing in others - but also uncovers the ways in
                    which employers collaborated through locally based trade and civic associations
                    to combat the union threat - linking community success to collective bargaining
                    and employee-employer cooperation. Her examination of the subtle power of civic
                    anti-unionism to undermine worker solidarity adds another important chapter to
                    the story of the failure of the American labor movement in the 1940s.</p>
                <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-105-1-108"/>
                <p>District 8 took a beating during the anticommunist offensive of that decade, and
                    collapsed completely by 1955, despite the strength of its radical unionism.
                    Nevertheless, District 8 is an important topic, Feurer concludes, because of its
                    considerable difference from mainstream unions: its commitment to civil rights,
                    its adherence to community-based organizing strategies, and its penchant for
                    eschewing collective bargaining and cooperation with employers in favor of shop
                    floor militancy. Although it disappeared - along with the rest of radical
                    American labor - its effort represents an important moment in labor history when
                    union activism and community organizing were fused by ordinary people who wanted
                    to participate in the decisions that shaped their lives. Feurer narrates that
                    moment - and captures its spirit - very well.</p>

                <p>Frank Vazzano argues in this straight-forward, accessible, and competent
                    biography that Martin L. Davey, <placeName>

                    </placeName> congressman (1919-1921 and 1923-1929) and governor (1935-1939),
                    gave &quot;friend and foe alike the political ride of their lives&quot;
                    (p. 274). But the portrait Vazzano draws of the conservative politician suggests
                    that the ride was mostly downhill.</p>
                <p>Vazzano begins his survey of Davey&apos;s life with a look at his troubled
                    boyhood. His father, English immigrant John Davey, was a distant and stern
                    figure who invented the art of tree surgery, but the resulting family fortune
                    came too late to spare Martin from the typical trials of an impoverished
                    turn-of-the-century American household. Indeed, much about Davey&apos;s life
                    was typical. Later, as mayor of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, he was a booster of the usual sort; as a congressman, his
                    combination of strong partisanship, populist instincts, and pro-business views
                    relegated him to the sidelines; and as governor, he cared more about reelection
                    than governing.</p>
                <p>As the book&apos;s title suggests, Davey was a better office-seeker than
                    officeholder. While a congressman, he preferred to skip votes and legislative
                    work to spend time with his family - and business - back in <placeName>

                    and 73 men at sea. Davey&apos;s time as governor is equally devoid of
                    general interest. The only really noteworthy event of his time in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013645" reg="Columbus"
                            >Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a tiff with presidential adviser Harry Hopkins over the
                    organization of New Deal relief efforts, which Vazzano treats in detail. More
                    important to Davey and more interesting to the contemporary reader, however,
                    were the methods that Governor Davey used to keep his political machine well
                    lubricated with both private and public money. Only vetted Democrats could
                    realistically hope to hold a government job, and Davey, with his henchman
                    Francis Poulson, assessed as much as 5 percent of state employees&apos;
                    salaries for their campaign coffers. There were also, of course, the usual side
                    payments and kickbacks associated with government purchasing and the
                    distribution of liquor licenses and similar privileges.</p>
                <p>In his conclusion, the sympathetic Vazzano excuses Davey&apos;s consistently
                    petulant responses to his critics, his unprincipled refusal to condemn the 1920s
                    Klan, and his use of public powers for private gain with the tepid admission
                    that the governor was &quot;a bit of a scoundrel&quot; (p. 274).
                    Scoundrel, though, is the wrong word. There was nothing charming or dashing
                    about the mature Davey, as there was about, say, Huey Long. Davey simply viewed
                    patronage and payouts as tools in the vote-winning game, not as ways to advance
                    the interests of the public at large or even of one class of the public.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, Vazzano&apos;s life of Davey, like William Pickett&apos;s
                    1990 biography of Homer Capehart, is a useful study of a fairly ordinary working
                    politician in twentieth-century <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                    </placeName>. Davey&apos;s story may not be inspiring, but that is
                    unsurprising; most political careers are not. Examining the circumstances and
                    responses of everyday politicians is a useful way to understand politics, and
                    incidentally a useful corrective to both romanticized and demonized conceptions
                    of the political vocation. An exclusive focus on the Roosevelts, Lincolns, and
                    Kennedys tends to distort those realities and to overshadow the experiences of
                    vast majority of men and women in public life. After all, to paraphrase Roman
                    Hruska, the mediocre politicians are entitled to a little attention,
                    aren&apos;t they?</p>

                <p>Susannah Walker&apos;s <hi rend="i">Style and Status</hi> makes a significant
                    contribution to the history of African American consumerism with particular
                    focus on women&apos;s beauty culture. The book, Walker&apos;s first,
                    explores the politics, practices, and processes of beauty culture to analyze how
                    &quot;the interplay of race, class and gender . . . shaped power
                    relationships in the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                    </placeName>&quot; (p. 5). Focused on the years between 1920 and 1975,
                    Walker draws on a rich array of sources including the company records of Claude
                    A. Barnett and Madam C.J. Walker (the latter of which are housed at the Indiana
                    Historical Society). Walker also analyzes oral histories, print advertisements,
                    and text and visuals in black newspapers and magazines. In exploring multiple
                    aspects of African American beauty culture, Walker not only draws on pioneering
                    scholarship in the field, but also builds upon Maxine Craig&apos;s recent
                    examination of beauty pageants (<hi rend="i">Ain&apos;t I a Beauty
                        Queen?</hi>, 2002) and upon my work on the black modeling industry. Mining
                    these primary and secondary sources allows Walker to trace entrepreneurship,
                    consumption, and identity formation to understand the shifting place of beauty
                    in defining urban African Americans&apos; gendered identities.</p>
                <p>In tracing the glory and decline of black-owned beauty businesses, Walker
                    incisively analyses the paradoxical consequences of white corporate efforts to
                    lure the &quot;New Negro market.&quot; Framing this discussion in the
                    trope of &quot;consumer citizenship&quot; - most notably defined by
                    Roland Marchand - Walker shows how black advocacy for white marketing to African
                    Americans proved a double-edged sword. By the late 1940s, white businesses
                    increasingly targeted African Americans as important &quot;new&quot;
                    consumers, yet this validation - long-desired by those like Barnett - undercut
                    the viability of black-owned business. With limited resources, the
                    long-established African American beauty business declined, along with
                    consumerist beauty ideals specified and negotiated by black communities. Walker
                    demonstrates how white advertisers in the 1970s commodified the Afro into a
                    trendy hairstyle, extricating the radical hairdo from its politicized meaning.
                    Walker&apos;s analysis of the Afro as a gendered, classed, and even
                    temporary fashion (through wig design), facilitates her argument for an
                    increasing disconnect between consumer-based visions of black female beauty and
                    those constructed and contested by divergent groups of African Americans.</p>
                <p>Walker offers an engaging narrative of changing market and consumer <pb n="103"
                        id="VAA4025-105-1-111"/>practices, although she might have focused more
                    attention on some matters. For example, Walker writes that shifting consumption
                    patterns during the 1940s diminished interactions between women. As women
                    shopped more often in drug and grocery stores, their personal connections with
                    door-to-door beauty agents - characteristic of commercial beauty culture in the
                    first decades of the twentieth century - declined. This shift deserves greater
                    consideration by looking more closely at beauty-product shopping as a
                    woman-centered activity. In lieu of the beauty agent, did women accompany and
                    advise each other, or did shopping for cosmetics become as banal as shopping for
                    milk? Was this an intergenerational experience? Did the developing youth culture
                    of these decades view this as a bonding activity or an act of rebellion?
                    Exploration of gendered beauty purchasing could provide further insight into the
                    social, economic and age-specific aspects of consumption.</p>
                <p>In other places, Walker develops the classed aspects of women&apos;s social
                    interactions. Noteworthy is her discussion of mega-beauty salons. Here, Walker
                    shows how women of all economic classes could afford - if only infrequently - a
                    trip to the beauty salon, where pampering and hair care proved a welcome escape
                    from drudge work for white employers. In recasting the beauty salon from social
                    space to one of upscale leisure, Walker shows that upper-end salons like Cardozo
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7015717" reg="District of Columbia"

                    </placeName>, implemented new measures such as appointment-keeping and a
                    &quot;no-gossip&quot; policy. Questioning the effectiveness of these
                    regulations, Walker portrays salons as woman-centered spaces where beauty was
                    not always the only, or even primary, concern. Overall, <hi rend="i">Style and
                        Status</hi> offers important contributions to several fields of historical

                        >Impossible Subjects</hi> examines the creation of the legal categories and
                    bureaucratic mechanisms that distinguished &quot;citizens&quot; from
                    &quot;aliens&quot; - integral members of the national polity from
                    &quot;subjects&quot; living at its margins.</p>
                <p>The book retraces the evolution of national laws, rulings, policies, and
                    structures from the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act, known for its restrictive national
                    quotas, to the more permissive 1965 Hart-Celler Act. Historians have pointed to
                    Hart-Celler as one of the foremost achievements of post-war liberalism. The law
                    dispensed with racial and national preferences, something President Lyndon B.
                    Johnson called &quot;a deep and painful flaw in the fabric of American
                    justice,&quot; and it opened the nation&apos;s doors to increasing
                    numbers of immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and Asia (p. 259).</p>
                <p>Ngai, however, skillfully reveals the central paradox of the 1965 act: founded in
                    &quot;the principle of formal equality&quot; and a valorization of
                    cultural pluralism, Hart-Celler actually &quot;comprised a complex of
                    measures that promoted both greater inclusions and greater exclusions&quot;
                    (p. 263). While the act banished old annual immigration quotas, it also imposed
                    new ones: 120,000 for the Western hemisphere; 170,000 for the Eastern hemisphere
                    (encompassing Europe, Asia, and Africa); 20,000 for any given country in the
                    Eastern hemi- sphere-a cap eventually extended to the Western hemisphere. This
                    new regime, though egalitarian in principle, failed to consider pressing
                    realities, including the historic permeability of borders and the large presence
                    of - and growing demand for - Mexican laborers. Consequently, hundreds of
                    thousands of &quot;illegal&quot; Mexicans were deported, and millions
                    more remained in the shadows of the body politic. Hart-Celler effectively
                    codified equality and pluralism at the expense of equity and practicability.</p>
                <p>The paradox of Hart-Celler makes sense in light of earlier reforms and policies,
                    which Ngai masterfully details in preceding chapters, drawing on previously
                    unexamined records of the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country>
                    </placeName> Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the years leading to and
                    following the Johnson Reed Act, politicians invoked &quot;national
                    sovereignty&quot; in seeking greater control over the nation&apos;s
                    gateways to stem the tide of &quot;undesirable&quot; Southern and
                    Eastern Europeans. That law introduced the first numerical restrictions (Chinese
                    exclusion notwithstanding) based on national origin, and in turn
                    &quot;created a new class of persons within the national polity - illegal
                    aliens - whose inclusion in the nation was at once a social reality and a legal
                    impossibility&quot; (p. 57). Johnson-Reed also inaugurated a period of
                    deportations, which had the unintended consequence of dramatically increasing
                    illegal migration from exempted countries of the Western <pb n="105"

                    borders and, Ngai contends, &quot;rearticulated the <placeName>

                    immigration&quot; (p. 67).</p>
                <p>The four decades framed by Johnson-Reed and Hart-Celler saw the fortification of
                    physical, legal, and racial boundaries separating Mexican, Filipino, Japanese,
                    and Chinese residents from the white body politic. Their systematic
                    racialization, juridical exclusion, or conditional admission into the national
                    polity occupies the middle chapters of Ngai&apos;s painstaking work.</p>
                <p>In spite of the book&apos;s breadth, <hi rend="i">Impossible Subjects</hi>
                    leaves us longing to know more about other American imperial subjects who

                    for young readers, this volume examines the life of Hoosier temperance and
                    suffrage reformer May Wright Sewall. Sewall is profiled here from her early age
                    through the decades of her public work. Through Sewall&apos;s life, young
                    readers will learn about nineteenth-century middle- and upper-class women -
                    their clubs, their benevolent and reform associations, their prospects for
                    education, and the fight by some for the right to vote. Sewall&apos;s life
                    story also sheds light on the peace movement during World War I and on the
                    American fascination with spiritualism, a practice to which Sewall turned in her
                    late life. The book is extensively illustrated and concludes with suggestions

                    an FBI agent, a teacher, and finally a sheriff. In a time when society would
                    have restricted him, Archey conquered obstacles by the virtue of perseverance.
                    Beineke, a former student of Archey, manges to navigate complex racial issues

                    stories, lush photographs, and an attention to detail that bring the company and

                    the Potomac in May 1863 had relatively few midwestern soldiers, any reader
                    interested in the history of ethnic troops, in particular German American
                    troops, in the Civil War should read this volume. Keller, using heretofore
                    unused German-language source, argues that the Battle of Chancellorsville, one
                    of the Confederacy&apos;s greatest victories, became &quot;the key event
                    of the nineteenth century for the nation&apos;s largest ethnicity&quot;
                    (p. 9). The author begins by setting German Americans within the context of
                    1850s nativism. He then looks at German Americans in the Union ranks before
                    Chancellorsville; offers a detailed chapter on the battle itself and on the
                    conduct of the Union&apos;s 11th Corps when confronted by the clearly
                    superior forces of Stonewall Jackson; studies how the &quot;overall
                    morale&quot; of the Northern Army and civilians was restored after the
                    battle &quot;at the expense of&quot; German soldiers; reads the German
                    American community&apos;s reaction in newspapers and family correspondence;
                    and finally considers how the memory of Chancellorsville affected German
                    American assimilation for the rest of the nineteenth century.</p>

                    urbanization, changing national identity, immigrants and immigration, and the
