            <p>There are many incidents connected with the settlement of all new countries, which, if committed to
                    writing or printing, would be a source of pleasure to those who come upon the stage of action long
                    after those who first made their settlement have gone to that "bourne from whence no
                    traveler returns".</p>
            <p>It is a source of regret to many of the descendants of the settlers of this part of the land that
                    they have not a more minute account of incidents that occurred from 1802 till 1820; for they have to
                    bring to their aid. the recollections of some who were but children, for the greater part of what
                    they know of but a small portion of the incidents connected with the settlement which was commenced
                    here in 1802. But in order that some few of those incidents may not be entirely forgotten, I will,
                    agreeable to a promise made to you, try, in my feeble manner, to write an article occasionally for
                    insertion in your paper (the <placeName>

                    that the style in which these articles may be written will be so fascinating as to cause them to be

                    privations and hardships endured by the early settlers of this part of the now great state of
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p>As an introductory article, I must give some of the incidents and reasons that induced the colony of
                    Swiss who first settled <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and vicinity to leave the ease and comfort of an old-settled and wealthy country to
                    come to a wilderness in search of a home. I will try and not make any of these articles too lengthy.</p>
            <p>In March, 1796, John James Dufour, a citizen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Canton De Vaud, in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, started from his native village for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, with the design of selecting in the then wilderness of the West a home for himself,
                    his brothers and sisters, and after examining different localities along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> rivers, from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he finally selected the lands between Hunt's creek and Indian creek as the
                    future home of himself, his brothers and sisters.</p>
            <p>Previous to his selecting these lands, he had formed a vineyard association with some of the citizens
                    of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, among whom were Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, Dr. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a Mr. Hart, and planted a vineyard on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> river, about four miles above the mouth of Hickman creek, in Jessamine county. This
                    vineyard was commenced in the spring of 1799.</p>
            <p>As yet, the brothers and sisters of John James Dufour had not come to this country, and the
                    preparation of the land for planting the vineyard and keeping it in order was done by Americans,
                    under the direction and superintendence of John James Dufour.</p>
            <p>On the first of January, 1801, the Dufour brothers and sisters, together with a few of their
                    neighbors, met together at the appointed place, for taking a last and long farewell to home, friends
                    and native country, to cross the broad Atlantic for their new home in an unknown and howling
                    wilderness where, instead of the voice of friends, they would hear the whoop of the Indian and the
                    howl of the wolf. It must have been an affecting scene to behold young men and young women, some of
                    them in their teens, and two or three infants, <pb n="3" id="VAA4025-020-1-005"/> bidding farewell
                    to friends and home, to settle in such a wilderness as this part of the country then was.</p>
            <p>The whole number who then came to this colony were seventeen souls: Daniel Dufour and his wife, John
                    Francis Dufour, David Dufour, Jane Maria Dufour, Antoinette Dufour, Susannah M. Dufour, Philip
                    Bettens, his wife and daughter, Jean Daniel Morerod, Francis Louis Siebenthal, John Francis
                    Siebenthal, Peter Borallay, his wife, son and daughter.</p>
            <p>After a boisterous voyage across the Atlantic they arrived at Norfolk, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, in May, 1801. From thence they crossed the Allegheny mountains in wagons, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, thence down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river to Maysville, and from there by land to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they arrived on the 3rd of July, and were present at the celebration of the 4th
                    of July; and on the 6th the seventeen souls arrived at the vineyard on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> river, where they remained for some time.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1802 these persons petitioned congress to pass an act authorizing then to enter
                    lands on an extended credit, with a view of giving them an opportunity of introducing the culture of
                    the grape in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Accordingly, on the 1st of May, 1802, an act was passed by congress and became a law,
                    giving them the power to enter four sections of land on a credit of twelve years. Under that act
                    about 2,500 acres were selected and about 1,200 acres more, adjoining thereto, was entered and paid
                    for as other purchasers of the public lands entered land; and after they commenced settling on these
                    lands they gave it the name of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>There were but few settlers near these lands when the settlement by the Swiss families commenced.</p>
            <p>The lands selected by John James Dufour for the settlement of his brothers, sisters and the other
                    emigrants who came with them to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, were fractional sections seven and eighteen, town one, range two; sections twelve and
                    fifteen, and fractional sections thirteen, fourteen, twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-seven, town
                    two, range three west, extending along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river from Hunt's creek down to the lands now owned by Francis E. Mennet,
                    whose <pb n="4" id="VAA4025-020-1-006"/> father, Samuel Mennet, Frederick L. Raymond, Frederick
                    Deserns, Louis Gex and Luke Oboussier, had joined this Swiss colony and purchased some of the lands
                    up the river to the road that turns out from the river bank and runs out to the Indian creek bridge,
                    passing the residence of the Widow Norrissey. The balance of these lands were divided among the
                    Dufour family, Golay, Siebenthal, Bettens and Morerod.</p>
            <p>These lands were covered with the heaviest forests, for which the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river bottoms were so famous, and the undergrowth being overrun with grape vines, made
                    it almost impossible to get through it. These almost impenetrable forests were more congenial for
                    the abode of the Indian, bear, wolf, catamount and wild cat, than for man. Suffice to say, that into
                    this forest these Swiss families had "come to stay", or, in other words, to find a
                    home, and with their vigorous arms and determined courage, to clear up the land and cultivate it as
                    a means of procuring a living.</p>
            <p>In 1803 some of these families came from the first vineyard in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to these lands. Jean Daniel Morerod and Philip Bettens moved into a cabin that had been
                    erected by some "squatters" on the public lands near where Charles
                    Norrissey's house stands, and remained there together until they could build themselves
                    cabins on their respective tracts of lands, which lie adjoining.</p>
            <p>They had for neighbors a family by the name of Maguire, who lived in a cabin some where near the lot
                    owned by William Hall, and John Rayl, who lived in the bottom opposite the foot of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> island, and Heathcoat Picket, the grandfather of Benjamin Picket, living near where the
                    Place house, now owned by Julius McMakin, stands, and Griffith Dickason, and William Cotton, who
                    lived on Indian creek, near where John Baker now lives.</p>
            <p>Any one who has assisted in opening a new settlement can easily understand what an undertaking it
                    must have been to clear the land and raise log houses where the settlements were so sparse, and they
                    may imagine what a work was here for persons to do, in this heavy forest, who had been born and
                    reared in a country that dated its settlement back to the time of the Ceasars, and who knew little
                    or nothing about</p>
            <pb n="5" id="VAA4025-020-1-007"/>
            <p>using the axe as our "Yankees" do, who had a house to raise, logs to cut and roll,
                    and but few, very few, neighbors who knew anything about this kind of work, to assist them.</p>
            <p>These persons had been accustomed to all the necessaries and many of the luxuries that could be
                    obtained in old settled countries; and here they were in a howling wilderness, far from any market
                    in which to purchase the coffee, chocolate and other articles of food and clothing-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> at that time being the nearest and most convenient place to obtain these articles.</p>
            <p>It is related of Mr. Bettens’ and Morerod's families, which were then small, that
                    when they had no milk, they did not use coffee. Their neighbor, Maguire, having a cow, sent them
                    milk every other day. On that day they used coffee, and on the day they received no milk they would
                    take the cloth in which the coffee was pounded (having no mill) and smell of it to get the flavor of
                    the coffee.</p>
            <p>During the spring of 1804 others of the Swiss families came to their lands, the
                    Siebenthal's, Golay's, Gex and others, so that the settlement was considerably
                    increased and the lands from that time began to be cleared up more rapidly; and in 1805 quite a good
                    crop of corn and some wheat was raised. The straw was saved, in a very neat manner, to make hats.
                    The Dufour girls made a great many of these hats, which were sent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> for sale.</p>
            <p>It was said of Mr. Morerod, who married one of the Dufour girls, Antoinette, that on one occasion his
                    wife had made two or three dozen of these hats which he took to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> with him in a canoe. While going up the street with these hats on his shoulder the
                    citizens ran after him to see what he had, and when they saw he had hats for sale he sold them all
                    in a very short time at about two and a half and three dollars each.</p>
            <p>Mr. Morerod used to relate many incidents in relation to the wild game that came about his clearing
                    and fields. I recollect he related that one fall in particular wild turkeys were so numerous and
                    tame that he was obliged to keep them away from his hogs when he fed them corn, as they could eat
                    the corn faster than the hogs could; and if a turkey</p>
            <pb n="6" id="VAA4025-020-1-008"/>
            <p>was needed for the table, nothing was necessary to be done but to select out one that appeared fat
                    and with a stick knock it over and kill it, which could be done very easily. Bear, deer and wilk
                    turkey were so plentiful that there was no fear of a famine for flesh to eat.</p>
            <p>Improvements began to be made at other points along the river above where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands, and the land on which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> was laid out was being cleared up, Daniel Dufour having commenced in 1804 to make an
                    opening between where William Hall resides and U. P. Schenck's warehouse; and John F.
                    Dufour, who was yet at the first vineyard, had hired some person to commence an opening on his land,
                    between where Vineyard and Liberty streets now run.</p>
            <p>About this time the Indians had been quite troublesome on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the settlers began to take precautions against a surprise, but they were not
                    molested, and matters were going on prosperously for the new settlement. Vineyards were being set
                    out as fast as it was possible to prepare the land for that purpose. But still the settlers were
                    almost shut out from the world around them. If they wished to get letters from their friends, or to
                    send any, they were obliged to go to Port William (now Carrollton), the nearest post office, and
                    that supplied with a mail once in two weeks, or perhaps once a week.</p>
            <p>These were privations which we at the present day would be very far from submitting to, for we can
                    now in a few hours get news direct from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">London</settlement>,
                            <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
               </placeName> and from the Pacific coast, and no
                    doubt we could receive at this time letters from Alaska in as short a space of time as they could at
                    that time from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City. What would some of our "Young America" say if they had to go
                    and settle in such a country and undergo the privations of the settlers of this part of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> county?</p>
            <p>Although from 1800 to the admission of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> into the Union as a state, that part of the present state of Indiana lying east of the
                    Indian Boundry, as it is called (commencing opposite the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> river) was in the Territory Northwest of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and the balance of the state and territory west to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> river was called Indiana territory, <pb n="7" id="VAA4025-020-1-009"/> until 1809, when
                    the territory was divided, and all west of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and a line drawn from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> due north, was called <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> territory.</p>
            <p>Nothing occurred to retard the clearing up of the land. The settlers were not molested by the
                    Indians, and enjoyed their health remarkably, and they began to gather about them cattle, horses and
                    hogs, but their hogs had to be taken good care of to prevent the bears and wolves from catching
                    them, which was of very common occurrence. And their fields and vineyards began to make quite a
                    contrast with the surrounding forest.</p>
            <p>The first wine made was in 1806 or ‘07. The quantity was quite limited, but of a very good
                    quality; but still the vineyards were enlarged every spring, so that the bearing vines became more
                    numerous from year to year, and the quality of wine also increased every year until the vintage of
                    1808 and ‘09 yielded: the former, 800, and the latter about 1,200 gallons of wine.</p>
            <p>Orchards were commenced so soon as land could be prepared for planting out the trees, and in a few
                    years quite large orchards were in a thrifty condition and some commenced bearing fruit.</p>
            <p>This will bring us to the commencement of the year 1809 and still the settlers were obliged to go in
                    canoes, skiffs or perogues to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> for their salt, iron, nails, groceries and dry goods, not yet enjoying the convenience
                    and luxury of a steamboat ride to the Queen city.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1809 John Francis Dufour came from the first vineyard in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to his land in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, as the settlement was then called. He built a cabin on the spot where Mr. William
                    Archer's kitchen stands. The cabin was built of small round logs, one and a half stories
                    high, in the midst of a heavy growth of timber, the logs being cut so near the spot where they were
                    raised that it required scarcely any hauling to be done. The logs of the cabin were hewed inside
                    after they were raised. Into this cabin Mr. Dufour, his wife and child then about eighteen or twenty
                    months old, moved, and he turned his attention to clearing more land, raising a crop and planting
                    out a vinyard.</p>
            <pb n="8" id="VAA4025-020-1-010"/>
            <p>The health of the colonists was preserved in a very surprising degree, considering the hardships and
                    privations they had to undergo. They had cleared a considerable quantity of land, and planted
                    several acres of vineyards, which began to bear fruit.</p>
            <p>But one great difficulty had yet to be overcome, as all their correspondence going through the mail
                    had to be sent to Port William before it could be put into the mail. John Francis Dufour drew up a
                    memorial to the postmaster general, which was signed by himself and all the citizens of the
                    neighborhood, and sent to Hon. Buckner Thruston, who was either a senator, delegate or
                    representative in congress. (Senator, 1805-9.) Upon its receipt, Mr. Thruston laid it before the
                    deputy postmaster general, which fact he communicated to Mr. Dufour by letter, of which the
                    following is a copy: </p>

            <p>This letter was directed to John Francis Dufour, Port Williams, Ky.</p>
            <p>The commission appointed John Francis Dufour of New <placeName>
                  <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>, <region type="county">Dearborn county</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana
                    territory, deputy postmaster aforesaid, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and bears date the 23rd day of March, 1810, and is signed by Gideon Granger, who was
                    then <pb n="9" id="VAA4025-020-1-011"/> postmaster general. This commission was resigned on the 20th
                    of September, 1835, to take effect on the 1st of October following, which was accepted by the
                    postmaster general. Whether the settlers received their letters and papers regularly by the mail, it
                    is impossible for the writer of this to say; but one fact will be very manifest to every one who may
                    read these articles—that they had no longer to go eight miles to the nearest post office.
                    Although the post office was called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there was no town laid off yet.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1810 the Swiss settlement extended from about where Liberty street of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> now is to where Francis E. Mennet resides, and had augmented from the three first
                    families, numbering seven persons, to thirteen families, numbering sixty-six persons; and as they
                    owned the lands about the mouth of Indian creek, they changed the name on account of the great
                    number of creeks in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> called Indian. The name given it by them was "Venoge", after a small
                    river in the Pays de Vaud, which empties into the beautiful lake <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Geneva</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and on the banks of which some of these Swiss were raised. A description of the
                    settlement cannot be better given than by copying here an account of it written by John F. Dufour,
                    in the fall of 1810, which is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>New <placeName>
                                <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                            </placeName> is situated on the right bank of the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                            </placeName> river, in Jefferson county, Indiana territory, about seven miles above the
                            mouth of the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                            </placeName> river. This settlement was begun in the spring of 1803, by some Swiss, of the
                            Canton of Vaud, formerly a part of the Canton of Verne. Their principal object is the
                            introduction of the culture of the grapevines in this country.</p>
                        <p>This settlement, or the place called New <placeName>
                                <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                            </placeName>, extends from the mouth of Plum creek, down the river to the mouth of Venoge
                            creek, known by the name of Indian creek, a distance of about four and a half miles,
                            fronting the river, and extending back for the quantity of about 3,700 acres of
                            land—2,500 acres of which they purchased under a law of congress in favor of John
                            James Dufour and his associates, allowing them twelve years to pay for it, from 1802, the
                            time of the purchase; the balance they have bought, as other purchasers, and paid for it.
                            The lower end, about two miles along the river is occupied by thirteen Swiss families,
                            composed of sixty-five individuals, of every age. Ten of these have successively come to
                            join the three first who had begun the settlement. Had it not been for the difficulties in
                            crossing the ocean, <pb n="10" id="VAA4025-020-1-012"/> it is believed the whole distance of
                            four and one-half miles would be filled up with many more of those industrious people.</p>
                        <p>The improvements of the Swiss are considerable, considering the time when they began, the few
                            hands employed, and their inexperience in the way of improving land in this country. They
                            have now about one hundred and forty acres of land under cultivation, about eight of which
                            are planted in grape vines, and now bearing, which offer to the eye of an observer the
                            handsomest and the most interesting agrciultural prospects which has perhaps ever existed in
                            the <placeName>
                                <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                            </placeName> of America. There are about eight or nine acres more planted in grapevines
                            which are not yet bearing, and they keep planting more every spring. The crop of wine of
                            this year (1810) has exceeded the quantity of 2,400 gallons, the quality of which is thought
                            by judges of wine to be superior to that of the Claret of Bordeaux. The black grapes with
                            which it is made are originally from the Cape of Good Hope. Out of the 2,400 gallons, about
                            120 was white or yellow wine, made with the Madeira grapes. These two kinds of wine are the
                            only ones which have hitherto succeeded, but others are going to be tried, and it is very
                            probably that some of them will also produce good wines. When the vines shall be older, and
                            the vine-dressers be able to let their wine acquire age before they sell it, its quality
                            will be much superior to what it is now, and there is no doubt but in the course of a
                            certain number of years the <placeName>
                                <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                            </placeName> will be able to do without importing wine. That precious culture will be tried
                            in different parts of the Union, and will undoubtedly multiply rapidly. The Swiss will
                            encourage it with all their power. They give slips gratis to whoever will plant them, with
                            directions and instructions as to their cutivation.</p>
                        <p>The Swiss also cultivate Indian corn, wheat, potatoes, hemp, flax, and other articles
                            necessary to farmers, although in small quantities. Some of their women manufacture a
                            certain quantity of straw hats, which they sell in <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                            </placeName>, and on the river to trading boats, carry them to the <placeName>

            <p>Such, then, were the leading features of the new settlement in 1810. There is no mention made of
                    grist mills and other necessary manufacturing establishments for the convenience of the people. As
                    for mills, nearly every family had one of their own, a hand mill, the stones of which were generally
                    about fifteen inches in diameter; or if it was thought to be more expeditious to convert corn and
                    wheat into meal and flour, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> must be crossed to go to a horse mill about four miles back from the river, near where
                    John Scott used to live. The sacks of grain were put on the horses, taken to the river, the sacks
                    put into a canoe and one person paddling across, another holding the horses behind the canoe, and
                    thus made to swim across the river. After the grinding was done the river was recrossed in the same
                    way. In that milling operation it required two men and two horses often two days to get two grists
                    of two and a half or three bushels each, ground and brought home.</p>
            <p>As for schools, they were almost unknown. Lucien Gex taught a school at Mr. Bettens, near the spot
                    where Samuel E. Pleasant's house now stands. This school was kept up for some two or three
                    years. The writer recollects attending that school at the age of about four years, going alone from
                    home (the place where William Archer's new building now stands) until he got to his uncle
                    Daniel Dufour's, and from there he and two cousins went on to their uncle
                    Morerod's, and were joined by two other cousins, and all proceeded to school. The French
                    language only was taught.</p>
            <p>It may be of interest to name some of the first born in the colony, who are now living.</p>
            <p>The first child born in the colony was a daughter of Mr. Bettens, born perhaps in 1803. She is still
                    living, and is the wife of Henry Brachman, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The next was a daughter of Mr. Morerod and a daughter of Daniel Dufour, born in 1804. They are both
                    living. The daughter of Mr. Morerod is Mrs. Harriet Tardy, of the firm of Tardy and Detraz,
                    milliners, of this place. The daughter of Daniel Dufour was married to John M. King, who was <pb n="12" id="VAA4025-020-1-014"/> in 1835 or ‘36 postmaster here, and was the first
                    auditor of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> county after that office was created. At last accounts she was living with one of her
                    daughters in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>During the winter of 1810-11, and the spring and summer of 1811, the settlers were often alarmed at
                    the news of Indian depredations on settlements north and northwest of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>. As the best means for safety, at night several families would meet at Mr.
                    Morerod's, as the most central and convenient place, the women and children remaining
                    within, with the door well barred, and the men by turns standing guard outside. How many anxious
                    nights were passed in this manner cannot now be told, but during the fall of 1810 and winter of
                    1810-11 this was kept up; the men working through the day in their fields and clearings not knowing
                    at what moment they might be attacked by Indians and massacred in the presence too, perhaps, of
                    their wives and little children. But fortunately they passed through the winter and spring without
                    any hostile demonstration being made against the settlement. Sometime before the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1811, the Indians became more hostile and attacked a settlement somewhere north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at a point which gave to that event the "Massacre of Pigeon Roost".
                    This occurred sometime in the winter of 1811-12, and as that had taken place within less than thirty
                    miles of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, the settlers were again thrown into dismay and consternation, not knowing but that
                    they would be attacked by these merciless savage foes, who spared none, regardless of age, sex or
                    condition. And this consternation was not confined to the settlers at New <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, but spread throughout the whole southern and southeastern portion of the territory.
                    This state of uncertainty continued during the spring of 1812, when the authorities ordered the
                    militia to be called out, and orders were issued by the commandants of regiments to have men raised
                    by voluntary enlistment. Elisha Golay, who had been commissioned a captain of the first batalion in
                    the first regiment of the militia of Jefferson county, by William Henry Harrison then governor of
                    Indiana territory-his commission bearing date of the 4th day <pb n="13" id="VAA4025-020-1-015"/> of

                                    your arrival at the frontier you will proceed without delay to build a block house
                                    [Buchanan's Station] of such size and form as will most securely and
                                    conveniently accommodate a detachment of from thirty to forty men, including
                                    officers. You will also keep a sufficient number of men on duty as rangers, both

                                    alarm either by an attack or otherwise, you will take the most speedy method of
                                    giving notice to the lieutenant colonel of this regiment; and in every case of this
                                    kind you are referred for further instructions to the orders of the

                                    of your forbearance with the enemy while on their frontiers, and in all cases, when
                                    there is strolling and skulking parties of Indians within the boundaries of your

                                    justify it. You will also be held responsible for your conduct while on this
                                    command. Your present tour will be for ten days from the time of your departure from
                                    this place, and at the same time you are not to come in with your men until a relief
                                    arrives, unless compelled by a superior force of the enemy. You will take care to

                    present bounds of Jefferson county, and was familiarly known and called, in after years,
                    "Buchannon's Station," which stood there until within a few years past.</p>
            <p>See with what minute details the order specifies the duties <pb n="15" id="VAA4025-020-1-017"/> of
                    the commander of this detachment of hardy backwoodsmen, while on duty far from the more settled
                    parts of the country, and on their enemies own ground. It was well known they had a wily and
                    treacherous enemy to deal with, and that it required prudence, courage and fortitude for so small a
                    number of men to meet perhaps hundreds of the savage foe whose mode of warfare was to spare neither
                    age, sex or condition, when they attacked the settlements of the white man. The duties assigned to
                    this detachment were strictly carried out and these hardy backwoodsmen again returned in safety to
                    their families and friends. After this time there were no more hostile Indian raids into the
                    settlements along and near the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river in this part of the territory.</p>
            <p>Among the names of those who composed this command may be recognized some who have been somewhat
                    prominent in the affairs of state. David Hillis, who represented Jefferson county in the
                    legislature, and was lieutenant governor of the state; the Vawters were men of note in the state;
                    after the formation of the state government John Vawter was a member of the senate for many years,
                    filled the office of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> marshal, for the district of Indiana, and was an active and influential friend and
                    advocate of the system of internal improvements, and he and one of the other Vawters were ministers
                    of the gospel who preached in this part of the territory. They were of the Baptist persuasion.
                    William Dunn was the father of Colonel William McKee Dunn, who is well known by the citizens of the
                    county. Luke Oboussier and Lewis Golay were residents of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>-the latter a brother of the captain and father of Selden T. Golay. Stephen <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rutherford</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the father of Joseph <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rutherford</settlement>
                    </placeName> of this place. John Tague was the father of Joseph Tague, who resides at Mt. Sterling.
                    James Picket was a brother of Heathcoat Picket and uncle to Benjamin Picket. Abraham Cline lived
                    below Indian Creek and I believe was related to the Raymonds and Edward Violet. Daniel Demaree was a
                    connection of the Demarees living on Indian <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, in Jefferson county, and those living in this county. Of the other members of that
                    detachment, the writer has no knowledge. These men were some of the instruments employed by God <pb n="16" id="VAA4025-020-1-018"/> in making this (then) wilderness a suitable abode for civilized
                    men, that He might honor and glorify the Creator and Preserver of their lives and health, and that
                    we, their descendants, might have "goodly heritage" and give God the praise for
                    all the mercies and blessings vouchsafed to us as a people.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1806 John James Dufour returned to Europe with the intention of settling his
                    affairs, and to raise money to pay the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government for the land purchased by him, which payment would become due in 1812 and
                    also to bring his family and his father to this country.</p>
            <p>In crossing the Atlantic ocean the vessel in which he had taken passage was captured by an English
                    man-of-war and taken to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the 4th of May, 1806. He remained in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, not being permitted to depart, until the 5th of June following, when he was permitted
                    to resume his journay to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>. He remained in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> until 1816, when he again returned to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. During his stay in Europe the war between Great Britain and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> commenced, and it was not thought advisable for him to start on his return during the
                    war, for fear of being captured, all the funds he had with him perhaps be taken from him and the
                    means for paying for the land would be lost—the time for the payment to the government
                    being near at hand. He sent a memorial to congress, setting forth the facts and asking an extension
                    of the time of payment, which was granted.</p>
            <p>At the conclusion of the war he returned and made final payment for the land. Those of the colony
                    here very much feared the land would be forfeited for non-payment, as there was not much prospect of
                    making that amount by the sale of the products of their farms.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1809, when John Francis Dufour left the first vineyard to come to New <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, he was one week in getting to Port William. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river was so high that the back water ran up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> river to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
                    </placeName>, making it necessary to row the small boat in which the voyage was made. On arriving at
                    Port William, it was found impossible for him to get up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to the place of his destination, alone. Leaving the boat, with his wife and only child,
                    and <pb n="17" id="VAA4025-020-1-019"/> what articles of household goods were on board, he walked up
                    to New <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> to get some of his friends from there to go and help him up with the small boat. On the
                    next morning they started up the river, and at night arrived at the mouth of Indian creek, during a
                    severe storm, which caused the river to be so rough that several articles which were heavy were
                    thrown overboard to lighten the boat, among them a large iron kettle and a pair of hand mill stones.</p>
            <p>In 1811 very severe shocks of earthquake were felt—the same shocks, no doubt, which were
                    so violent along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> river, and caused the opening and the sinking of the earth at New Madrid. The person
                    who was mail carrier at that time, and supplied the post office at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was staying at the house of John Francis Dufour. During the night, his horse was
                    fastened to the end of the cabin. During the night the shocks were so severe that the inmates were
                    awakened, not knowing what it was. At first they thought that Indians had surrounded the house and
                    were trying to get into it; but not hearing any noise, it was then thought it might possibly be the
                    horse rubbing against the house and then all was still. In the morning, however, feeling the house
                    to shake, and not knowing what caused it, on looking out at the window, which faced to the
                    southwest, the trees were perceived to be swaying to and fro, as violently as though the wind was
                    very high, when in fact it was very still, no wind blowing. Then, and not till then, did the inmates
                    of the little cabin, who were very much alarmed during the night—fearing that Indians had
                    surrounded them—ascertain that it was one of those terrible convulsions of the earth, an
                    earthquake. These shocks were felt at intervals, for two or three days.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1812, a family residing about where Louis Schroeder lives, consisting of a man and
                    his wife, whose name is not now recollected, but thought to be Rayls—the man being up in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> working (on this side of the creek)-the woman heard the firing of guns up the creek,
                    and supposing that Indians were in the neighborhood, became alarmed for her husband's
                    safety. There then being no nearer neighbors than at the mouth of the creek, she proceeded down to
                    where Edward Violet and his father were at work in the field, <pb n="18" id="VAA4025-020-1-020"/>
                    and crying out loudly for help, the father directed his son Edward to go and ascertain the cause of
                    the noise they heard. When he came to where the woman was he found that she was very much frightened
                    saying that large numbers of Indians were coming down the creek, for she had heard the firing of the
                    guns. She was set over the creek, and for safety proceeded up to where her husband was at work.</p>
            <p>During the years 1812, ‘13, ‘14 all the business relating to the county of
                    Jefferson—of which what is now <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> county formed a part—was transacted at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The returns of elections, returns of overseer of roads, battalion and regimental
                    musters, and various other duties of officers and citizens, were transacted and performed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the county seat. The population of this part of the county of Jefferson increased in
                    such a manner that the assessor for 1813 was appointed from among the citizens of this part of the
                    county, and John Francis Dufour was in February, 1812, appointed by the court assessor for and
                    within the county of Jefferson; and in October of that year he was appointed county surveyor of
                    Jefferson, by Thomas Posey, then governor of Indiana territory. These matters are mentioned only to
                    show that the interests of the county were such as to require the appointment of the county officers
                    residing in this part of the county.</p>
            <p>Some time during the years 1812 and ‘13 a grist mill was built at Laughery, near where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands, and a horse mill opposite Port William. The latter was known as
                    Mclntire's mill, having been built by a person of that name, who was the grandfather of
                    Joseph Netherland. Very frequently persons from the settlement would have to remain two days before
                    getting their grinding done at the horse mill; and often two or three would join together, load a
                    large canoe, take it up the river to the mouth of Laughery, and up the creek as far as they could
                    get, and then get a wagon to haul their grain from there to the mill. In this manner, perhaps after
                    an absence of two or three days, they would return with their grists of meal.</p>
            <p>After the declaration of war against Great Britain, in 1812, the Indians in the northern part of the
                    territory, and <pb n="19" id="VAA4025-020-1-021"/> along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> river, appeared quite hostile to their white neighbors and as a precaution against the
                    possibility of their making a sudden descent upon the settlement in the southern part of the
                    territory and along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river, "rangers," as they were termed, were sent out quite a distance
                    into the interior to watch their movements, and give timely notice of their approach.</p>
            <p>These men were taken from the companies of militia which were organized by voluntary enlistment. The
                    year or years in which these rangers served, is not exactly known; but the names of some of them
                    which are recollected are John Stepleton, William Keith, Samuel Peak, Lewis Golay, David Golay,
                    Peter Nighswonger, Thomas Rayl, Peter Lock, James Picket, Jesse Warden, James A. Stewart, one White,
                    William Miller and Abraham Miller, his father, Edward Violet, and many others whose names are
                    forgotten. These rangers would go out into the interior up Laughery, near where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands, and range to the west a considerable distance. At one time they went as far
                    as Fort Harrison.</p>
            <p>Many incidents no doubt occurred on these tours of duty by these hardy pioneers, which, if they could
                    be related in these numbers, would be highly interesting to their descendants, who are very numerous
                    in the county; but unfortunately, the actors in these affairs have passed away from our midst
                    without committing to writing any of those thrilling incidents attending the camp duty and camp
                    life, and they are lost to us.</p>
            <p>Some time after the rangers were dismissed from duty, and it no longer required their presence in the
                    interior, one of them in an evil hour, was tempted to commit a crime, and, yielding to that
                    temptation, was prosecuted in the courts for stealing a barrel of whisky or cider. A trading boat
                    having landed below the foot of the island, had, among other articles, whisky, on board to sell.
                    This man, whose name was Peter Lock, a very large robust young man, managed to get a barrel of
                    whisky out of the boat and carried or rolled it into a thicket a short distance back from the river
                    bank. By some means he was discovered as the thief, or suspected. Proceedings were instituted
                    against him for the theft, and Amos Lane, then supposed to be the most able lawyer among us, was
                    employed <pb n="20" id="VAA4025-020-1-022"/> to defend him. He was acquitted and the fee that Lane
                    received for his services was the transfer of a certificate for the south half of a quarter section
                    of land lying on Plum creek, which Lane afterward sold to Amos Gilbert and is the land now owned and
                    occupied by Thomas Huffman.</p>
            <p>John James Dufour died in the spring of 1827, at his residence above Log Lick, leaving his property
                    to his only son, Daniel Vincent Dufour. Francis Louis Siebenthal died of a disease contracted in the
                    lower country, where he had gone with a boatload of produce, some time about the year 1824 or 1825.
                    His son, John Francis Siebenthal, died near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, about nine years since.</p>
            <p>The old gentleman Borallay died from the effects of the kick of a horse, some few years after coming
                    to this country. His widow lived to be a very old person. His son Peter died about the year 1854, on
                    the old homestead in Garrard county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. The daughter was married to a man named Mayfield, who removed to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe county</region>
                    </placeName> in this state, where she died, leaving quite a large family, some of whom are still
                    living in that county.</p>
            <p>Phillip Bettens lived and died on his farm just below <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>—the front part of the farm being now owned by his daughter, Mrs. Duplau, and
                    Samuel E. Pleasants. His wife died a few years after. His daughter, who married John Detraz, died
                    about three years since.</p>
            <p>Daniel Dufour died in the winter of 1854, lacking a few days of 90 years of age. His wife died in the
                    summer of 1865, aged about 88 years.</p>
            <p>John Francis Dufour died in June, 1850, having been taken ill during the sitting of the circuit
                    court, of which court he was, at the time, one of the associate judges.</p>
            <p>Jean Daniel Morerod was married to Antoinette Dufour, and they lived and died on their farm below <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on which John R. Morerod, their son, is now living. Mr. Morerod died about the year
                    1838, and Mrs. Morerod in the winter of 1857.</p>
            <p>Jane Maria Dufour married John Francis Siebenthal, and lived for many years on their farm, being the
                    one now owned by the widow and heirs of William Norrisey. Mrs. Siebenthal died in the neighborhood
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, some years since, and shortly afterwards Mr. Siebenthal died.</p>
            <pb n="21" id="VAA4025-020-1-023"/>
            <p>Susannah M. Dufour was married to Elisha Golay, and lived on their farm above Plum creek, until both
                    became of such age as to make it advisable for them to cease from the labors attendant on farming.
                    They lived with their son, Constant Golay. Mrs. Golay died in 1866, aged about 80 years, and her
                    husband died about one year afterwards, aged 83 past.</p>
            <p>One member of the Dufour family, Aime Dufour, who was quite young when the colonists left their
                    native country, was not permitted to accompany them on account of his being too young. After he had
                    grown up and completed his education, he came to this country in 1816, residing in this neighborhood
                    for some years, when he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and finally settled at Vermillionville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>, where he was still residing about two years since.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to state with any degree of certainty the number of the descendants of the Dufour
                    family, but as near as can be ascertained at present, the number cannot be much under one hundred
                    and seventy-five or eighty.</p>
            <p>At this time there is no one of those who were grown at the time of their settling in the colony now
                    living, except the widow of John Francis Dufour, who is still living, and is near 80 years of age.</p>
            <p>The population of this part of the state during 1812, 1813 and 1814, commenced increasing
                    considerably. In 1812 the population within the present bounds of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> county was about 900; in 1813 at the time the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> was laid out, it was about 1,000, and was mostly confined to the immediate vicinity of
                    the river and creek bottoms; in 1815 the population was ascertained to be 1,800 souls.</p>
            <p>The vineyards began to produce, and still more were being planted every year. The vintage of 1812
                    produced about 800 gallons more than that of 1810-the crop not being as good as it was in 1810. The
                    production continued increasing from year to year, until in 1818 the quantity of wine made by the
                    colonists was about seven thousand gallons. At the time of the greatest prosperity of the grape
                    culture, the number of acres in vines could not have been less than forty-five, and the quantity of
                    wine made about twelve thousand gallons.</p>
            <p>As the old persons began to decline in years, and were no longer able to attend to the vineyards, and
                    their children began <pb n="22" id="VAA4025-020-1-024"/> to take charge of these matters the culture
                    began to be neglected and their attention was turned more to raising corn and potatoes; so that at
                    this time there is but little wine made on the farms where such quantities were made in bygone
                    years.</p>
            <p>The vineyards were places of resort for those who visited this place; some, perhaps, from curiosity,
                    and others again with a view of having a wine party. On such occasions, frequently during the
                    sitting of the court, the lawyers and judges were in the habit of spending an evening or perhaps an
                    afternoon in quaffing some of "Father Morerod's" wine. Frequently on such
                    occasions some one of the company would perhaps indulge rather freely of the wine, so that it was
                    necessary for some one of his companions, and often two or three to assist him in getting to his
                    lodgings at the hotel.</p>
            <p>On some of these occasions the governors of Indiana, and the senators and representatives in congress
                    have been known to participate in these social gatherings, and in that manner the fame of "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> Wine" was spread abroad.</p>
            <p>During John James Dufour's absence in Europe, when writing to his brothers and sisters, he
                    would invariably urge them to be industrious in the management of their vineyards, and gave
                    directions about many of the particulars necessary to be observed to succeed in making good wine.
                    And in writing about the laying off the town, he was very solicitous about the manner in which it
                    should be done.</p>
            <p>The reason, no doubt, of his anxiety about the success of the colony in succeeding in their
                    undertaking, was that his father, when they left Europe, had entrusted the care of his children to
                    his eldest son. This was done by a writing, in which the father transferred his paternal care over
                    his children to his eldest son, John James Dufour; and by that writing it was enjoined upon the said
                    John James Dufour to learn them to be industrious, economical and sober, and see that they did not
                    become indolent, proud and haughty; and above all, that he should use his efforts to instruct and
                    persuade them as to the truths of the Christian religion, and for that purpose he was directed
                    fervently to pray the God of mercy, as he (the father) would also himself do, that He would open
                    their hearts <pb n="23" id="VAA4025-020-1-025"/> and consciences to the true Christian faith, as the
                    only means of making them happy in this world, and to assure true felicity in the life to come.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1813, it having been decided by John Francis Dufour to lay off part of his land into
                    town lots, and as it was necessary to make the streets run as near at right angles with the river as
                    possible, it became necessary to run down on to Daniel Dufour's land a short distance, and
                    up on John James Dufour's land. The lots were laid off partly in the woods and partly in a
                    "deadening," as it was termed, the timber having been previously girdled. The town
                    plat was made out and recorded in the recorder's office of Jefferson county, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Notice of the sale of the lots was inserted in papers published at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the sale of the lots took place in October or November of the year 1813. The sale
                    was cried by one John M. Johnson, the clerk of the sale being Elisha Golay. At the sale many persons
                    from abroad purchased lots: Jeremiah Smock, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette county</region>
                    </placeName>, Ky., purchased lot No. 135; Jacob Mikesell purchased lot No. 133; William Mcllvain,
                    lot No. 124; Peter Mikesell, lot No. 134; John Patterson, lot No. 129; John Hill, of Scott county,
                    Ky., lot No. 125; Joab <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, lot No. 152; Jesse Lamme, lots Nos. 165, 166, 167 and 168; John Scott, lots Nos. 85
                    and 87; Abner K. Starr, lots Nos. 123 and 183; Joseph Noble, lots Nos. 58 and 91; and many others,
                    too numerous to mention here. The prices of lots varied considerably-the lowest selling for
                    $22 and the highest for $92. The one sold for $22, was No. 26, and
                    the one sold for $92, being No. 66.</p>
            <p>During the spring and summer of 1814, buildings began to be put up in different parts of the town.
                    John Francis Dufour had the first house built after the town was laid out, on the lot where Charles
                    Thiebaud's brick building on Main street stands. It was built for him by Samuel <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, (now living near Plumb Creek bridge,) and his father. It was hewed or
                    "scutched," after it was raised. That same spring Joshua Jones, who had a set of
                    house logs hewed somewhere near Grant's creek, floated them down to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and put up a house of them on the lot now owned by James F. Bristow, <pb n="24" id="VAA4025-020-1-026"/> and commenced the manufacture of split-bottom chairs. John Scott, the
                    father-in-law of James Cole, built a house the same summer, on the lot corner of Main Cross and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName> streets, opposite to Benjamin Schenck's dwelling, in which he lived several
                    years, and carried on his trade of tailor.</p>
            <p>During the spring of 1814, John Dumont came here and built a house on the spot where his present
                    brick building stands, where he has remained ever since.</p>
            <p>As the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> had now become a fixed "institution," and the population of that
                    territory which was during the year organized into a county and named after the native country of
                    the proprietors, "<placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>," had augmented to about 1,600 souls, and was constantly augmenting, it became
                    necessary to have a county organized to suit the convenience of the citizens who were then compelled
                    to go from the extreme upper end of (now) <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> county, at the mouth of Grant's creek, for all such business as had
                    necessarily to be transacted at the county seat to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In answer to an application of a number of citizens, by petition to the legislature of
                    the territory of Indiana, the county was organized. John Francis Dufour and Elisha Golay being the
                    most active and influential friends of the measure, attended the session of the legislature as lobby
                    members that year, and had the satisfaction of having their efforts crowned with success.</p>
            <p>During the fall of 1813, Robert Bakes came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and established a carding machine on the lot corner of Main and Vineyard streets, now
                    owned and occupied by George W. Hathorn; and the following spring, James Rous, the father of Ladig
                    and Percy Rous, from representations made to him by Mr. Bakes, what a fine country it was, came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and bought the lot immediately above the one owned by Mr. Bakes, on Vineyard street,
                    which lot is now owned by John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Bakes ran his carding machine in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> for some years, when he built a mill on Long Run, where Siebenthal's mill now
                    stands; and Mr. Rous remained in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> for some time, when he removed to the country and located on the farm which is now the
                    pauper farm. Mr. Bakes had his mill so arranged that he carded wool and ground grain; and Mr. Rous
                    built a horse mill on the top of the hill, near to Mr. Bakes. Often in <pb n="25" id="VAA4025-020-1-027"/> the summer and fall months, when there was not sufficient water to run
                    Bakes’ mill, Mr. Rous’ horse mill was running, and did all the neighborhood
                    grinding. Many times when clouds would rise, with the appearance of rain, they would seem to part to
                    the west of the mill, and no rain falling, gave the opportunity to Bakes or some other person who
                    wished to carry on a joke, for saying that Mr. Rous, by some necromancy, and raising a long pole,
                    would part the clouds and prevent the rain from falling to raise the run, and thereby Bakes could
                    not run his mill, so that Rous could have all the grinding to do on his horse mill.</p>
            <p>During the spring of 1814, John Francis Dufour commenced having logs hewed, with which to build a
                    house, which was built at the corner of Main-Cross and Market streets, and partly finished in the
                    fall; and was the same house that William Archer demolished last fall to make room for the frame he
                    has constructed in its stead. In that house the courts were held for a time, and for many years the
                    post office and clerk's office were kept in it. The courts were also held for a while at
                    the house of Robert M. Trotter, who was a relative of Gabriel Johnson, whose house was situated on
                    Main street, and occasionally at the house of Thomas Armstrong.</p>
            <p>The county of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> being organized, it became necessary to have officers to transact the business
                    necessary for the public interest, the maintenance of order, and the execution of the laws.</p>
            <p>The governor of the territory having the power of appointing all the necessary officers, both civil
                    and military, in the exercise of that power appointed the following named persons:</p>
            <p>For associate judges of the circuit court, William Cotton and James McClure; sheriff, John Francis
                    Siebenthal; coroner, Ralph Cotton; clerk, John Francis Dufour; county surveyor, Elisha Golay;
                    recorder, John Francis Dufour. The commissions are all dated the 15th of September, 1814, except
                    that of the recorder, which is dated 11th October, 1814, and are signed by Thomas Posey, as
                    governor, and John Gibson, as secretary.</p>

            <p>The commissions of the other officers of the county were in the same words as the one to Ralph Cotton
                    as coroner, with the exception of the name of the person and of the office to which the person was
                    appointed. It now became necessary that the officers should be sworn into office, and as the laws in
                    force at that time seem to have been silent as to what officers were entitled or authorized to
                    administer such oaths, Governor Posey made the following appointment of a person to administer the

            <p>Under this appointment the oath of office was administered to all the officers both civil and
                    military, and the county business whatever that might be, could now be administered according to
                    law.</p>
            <p>The county seat had not been established and no place for holding the courts, had been selected. This
                    selection, it would seem, belonged to the county to determine, until such time as a permanent seat
                    of justice should be created, according to law. Provisions for that purpose were made by a law of
                    the territory passed in 1813, prescribing the manner of establishing seats of justice in newly
                    organized counties. The associate judges of the counties constituted the county court, and had the
                    transaction of the county business entrusted by law to them. The same duties pertained to them as
                    now pertain to our present boards of county commissioners.</p>

                    </placeName>, named persons as commissioners to locate the seat of justice for the county. The names
                    of three of the commissioners only are known. The three who performed the duties required were Jesse

                            marked C, provided the seat of justice was fixed on fraction 35, town 2, range 1, west; and
                            marked D and E, provided said seat of justice was fixed on fraction 3, town 2, range 2,
                            west; and the additional proposed donations marked F, provided said seat of justice was
                            fixed on fraction 6, town 2, range 1, aforesaid.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon on Thursday, the 27th of October 1814 we proceeded to examine the places above
                            proposed (except the fraction 35 aforesaid which, from its extreme southeastwardly
                            situation, we considered as entirely ineligible), and also to examine the boundaries, the
                            land, and the central parts of said county, and taking into consideration the extent of the
                            county, the quality of the land, and the prospect of the future, as well as the weight of
                            present population, together with the probability of future divisions, we have fixed upon
                            the Public Square in the town of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                            </placeName>, in fractions 23 and 14, in town 2, range 3, west, as the most eligible place
                            for the permanent seat of justice of said county, and do hereby declare that it is our
                            opinion, judgment and determination that the seat of justice for said county be fixed and
                                <pb n="31" id="VAA4025-020-1-033"/> remain permanently at the place aforesaid. Given

                            compose one township, to be known by the name of Posey; and that all that part which lies

                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The court also ordered that the place of holding elections in Posey township be at the house of Lewis
                    Jones, in said township; and that the place of holding elections in Jefferson township, should be at
                    the house of Robert M. Trotter, in the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in said township.</p>
            <p>The court also ordered that William Pierson be appointed superintendent of elections in the township

                    Jefferson.</p>
            <p>The court appointed Robert Cotton, a brother of Judge William Cotton, Charles F. Krutz, the father of
                    William G. Krutz, now of Florence, and Joseph Noble, father of Charles, Lewis and Oliver Noble, of

                    to the governor as proper persons for the office of justices of the peace for Posey township; and
                    George H. Kyle, was recommended by the court to the governor, to be reappointed justice of the peace
                    for the lower end of Jefferson township.</p>
            <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-020-1-034"/>
            <p>Elisha Golay, who had ben appointed county surveyor by the governor, having declined to accept the
                    appointment, the court recommended John Gilliland as a proper person to fill that office.</p>
            <p>On the 25th of November, 1814, the court, according to the provisions of an act of the territorial
                    legislature, approved March 2d, 1813, entitled "An act for fixing the seats of justice in
                    all new counties hereafter to be laid off," appointed Elisha Golay agent for the county;
                    and at the same time the court instructed the county agent thus appointed, "to cause a jail
                    house to be built on the corner of lot No. 60, in the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>," which jail was built, and on the 30th of March, 1815, the court directed
                    that the said county agent "pay to Hiram Ogle the sum of money which, as agent of the
                    county, he is bound to pay him for building a jail house in the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in and for said county." The jail thus built was of hewed logs about one foot
                    square, one story high, and stood where the stone blacksmith shop occupied by Joseph <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rutherford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, now stands.</p>
            <p>When the court met on the 3d of May, 1815, it appears that there had not been as yet any necessity
                    for using the jail, unless it was used without lock and key, for the county agent was directed to
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>procure a strong lock for the jail, also a strong padlock, and cause them to be put on the
                            doors of said jail, also a common double padlock for the gable-end door.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Said county agent was also instructed <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>to cause the corners of the jail house to be cut down, and also such trees as are in danger
                            of falling on said house and pay for the same out of any money which may come to his hands,
                            belonging to the county.</p>

            <p>Persons at this day might probably suppose that there was not much use in putting a criminal into
                    such a jail, with only a strong lock and padlock to keep those confined therein from making their
                    escape. And they might also wonder why it was ordered to cut down the corners of the jail after it
                    was built. In raising log houses in those days, the ends of the logs projected nearly one foot and
                    it was the cutting off the ends of these projections which is meant by having the "corners
                    of the jail cut down."</p>
            <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-020-1-035"/>
            <p>Some years after that jail was in use, a prisoner was confined therein, having friends outside to
                    assist him, who gave him a saw, with which, during the night he sawed off a log, slipped it out, and
                    thereby made an opening large enough for him to make his escape. Afterwards another prisoner, named
                    Thomas Coen, was confined for some violation of the law and he, to free himself from
                    "durance vile," as attorneys say, set fire to the jail, made his escape, and
                    perched himself on the top of the hill above where the woolen factory now stands, and remained there
                    until the place of his recent confinement was entirely reduced to ashes.</p>
            <p>At a meeting of the court on the 30th of March, 1814, Elisha Golay, agent for the county, was

            <p>On the 2d of May, 1814, the court met and were engaged most of the day in arranging a plan for said
                    building, when it was thought advisable to alter the dimensions, which had been previously agreed
                    upon, so as to make the house thirty-six by thirty-two; and after having agreed upon the plan,
                    Elisha Golay, agent for the county, was ordered to proceed to the letting the building of said house
                    to the lowest bidder, when it was struck off to John Tandy of Gallatin county, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, at the sum of $1705. Then it was ordered that Major Elisha Golay, agent for

                    off to Samuel Davies, at the sum of twenty-six dollars and seventy-five cents.</p>
            <p>The court house was not finished so as to be used until perhaps in 1816. Stephen C. Stevens was

                    This society was composed of members who paid a certain amount into the treasury annually, which
                    amounts were expended for the purchase of books. In November, 1814, the president and directors of
                    the society appointed John Francis Dufour to solicit donations. The following appointment was given

                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, about the year 1832 or 1833, and it is presumed what is left of it may be in the
                    possession of one of his sons.</p>
            <p>Of the in-lots laid out in 1813, eight were reserved and donated to the Seminary of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, which was afterwards, in 1816 incorporated by the legislature. On one of these lots a
                    log school house was built in the fall of 1815, in which a school was maintained and kept up for
                    some years. This house stood on the lot now owned in part by Joseph Peelman, on Ferry street, on the
                    spot where said Peelman's brick dwelling stands. These lots, after the introduction of our
                    present common school system, were, by the common consent of the donor, John Francis Dufour, the
                    trustees of the town and citizens, disposed of, and the proceeds merged into the common <pb n="35" id="VAA4025-020-1-037"/> school fund, in the building of a school house, and afterwards used in
                    aid of the building of our present public school building.</p>
            <p>During the summer of 1814, the town and the surrounding country commenced improving quite rapidly.
                    There was in the town several stores, two or three taverns, two or three blacksmith shops, one or
                    two tailors, a chair factory, and a manufactory of large and small wheels for spinning and reels.
                    But still the country was new and very sparsely settled, for wolves were so plentiful and
                    troublesome that the territorial legislature had passed a law giving a bounty of one dollar for each
                    wolf scalp, that the person claiming the bounty, should prove to the satisfaction of the county
                    agent he or she had killed. Under this law an allowance was made in 1815, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Elizabeth Jones is allowed one dollar for the scalp of a wolf killed by her in 1814.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is related that on one occasion Heathcoat Picket and his brother James had gone on a ridge west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jacksonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, near where there was a bear wallow, for the purpose of killing deer. Heathcoat went on
                    one ridge and James on another, thinking to chase the deer, from one ridge to the other. While thus
                    separated, James was surrounded by a pack of wolves, which commenced their howling, with their head
                    raised up, as if looking at something in the tops of the trees. Heathcoat hearing this barking or
                    howling, went over to where James was, to see what caused such a howling, when he beheld the wolves
                    around James, and James looking up into the tree tops as if trying to see what the wolves were
                    barking at. When Heathcoat came where James was, he asked James what all this meant. James replied
                    "these dogs have treed something. See how they bark at it." James had taken this
                    pack of wolves for dogs.</p>
            <p>Sometime in the fall of 1814, the news of McDonough's victory over the British on Lake
                    Champlain was received by the citizens of the young town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who, to show their joy at the reception of the news of the victory, decided to have an
                    illumination of the town. Every house, in fact, every window <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-020-1-038"/> in
                    every house, was as brilliantly illuminated as could be with common tallow candles.</p>

                    </placeName>, until in 1814 and perhaps later, there were but few ministers of the Gospel in this
                    region of country. Until there were ministers to preach the Gospel it was the custom among the Swiss
                    colonists to meet together on the Sabbath and engage in singing psalms, reading prayers, and
                    sermons, which was continued for many years.</p>

                    above Florence, would be on this side of the river and would preach. They were both of the Baptist
                    persuasion. Sometimes one of the Vawters, of whom mention is made in a former number, preached in
                    this vicinity.</p>

                    </placeName> Historical society, August 19, 1922, on occasion of Vernon Homecoming.)</p>
            <p>It has been interesting to learn something of the accomplishments and plans for future usefulness of
                    your county historical society. The history of Jennings county, in general, is more or less
                    characteristic of that of other counties in this vicinity and of the entire state. There are,
                    however, several outstanding historical features in this section of Indiana, which were of such
                    considerable significance in the making of our great state, which entered so forcibly into the
                    lives, the early struggles and hardships of our forebears, the pioneers, that they well deserve
                    special mention on this occasion.</p>
            <p>The topic assigned me for discussion, "Phases of Southeastern Indiana History",
                    affords a wealth of material. So numerous are the aspects of history that have contributed to the
                    development of our great commonweealth in Southeastern Indiana alone, that it would seem that we of
                    this generation have, indeed, come a long way, and I have realized anew in making this study, and
                    perhaps more forcibly than ever before, how much we owe to future generations if we are to prove
                    worthy of the trust that has been imposed upon us by our ancestors, the Indiana pioneers.</p>
            <p>But in any retrospective glance of this subject our attention usually reverts, first of all, to the
                    aboriginal inhabitants of this country, to the American Indian. If we are kindly disposed and just
                    in this reflection we think of him first in his native state, before he was confronted with the
                    necessity of battling for his home as a result of the coming of the white man who was ever
                    encroaching upon his territory. As our thoughts revert to the Indian, we most naturally, however,
                        <pb n="38" id="VAA4025-020-1-040"/> recall stories of the Indian wars-of the tomahawk and
                    knife-but may we not consider him for a moment as he roamed through the forest, along the streams,
                    in search of his daily food, and as he peacefully worshipped the Great Mystery at sunrise or sunset,
                    alone and in silence, on the crest of a cliff or upon the mountain top, in the waterfall, the
                    thunderstorm, the winds. Few of the many Indiana historians have even alluded to this phase of the
                    Indian's life and it has remained for some of the educated Indians, themselves, as Dr.
                    Charles A. Eastman, to reveal in the most forceful manner something of the Soul of the Indian in his
                    book of that title in which he has portrayed the religious life of the typical American Indian
                    before he knew the white man.</p>
            <p>The dominance of the Indian in the earliest history of Southeastern Indiana and of the entire state
                    is familiar to everyone. While in some sections of our state from which counties have been erected,
                    we read of the peaceful characteristics of the Indians toward the white man and the readiness with
                    which they gave up their lands, in many parts of the territory which later became Indiana the
                    Indians were hostile to the white man, and there is ample evidence of the fact that this attitude
                    pretty generally prevailed in Southeastern Indiana.</p>
            <p>The Indian tribes within the limits of the present state consisted mainly of the Miami Confederacy,
                    the Pottawattomies and the Delawares. The Miamis, at the Greenville treaty of 1795, through Little
                    Turtle, their spokesman, claimed to have held from time immemorial a large territory that included
                    all of Indiana. Such other tribes as occupied any part of that region seem to have done so by
                    invitation or sufferance of the Miamis. The towns of what was known as the Miami federation were
                    mostly along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, from the site of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, each of the various subtribes having its own locality.</p>
            <p>The Pottawattomies occupied that part of the state lying north and northwest of the Miami country, as
                    far eastward as the headwaters of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> and Eel rivers and the Delawares had the <geogName>White River</geogName> valley, their
                    most eastern town standing where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> now is. The south part of the <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-020-1-041"/> territory east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> is said to have been common hunting ground. Although there were aboriginal villages
                    here and there throughout that region, whether these were in any sense permanent or other than
                    villages of hunting parties is not established.</p>
            <p>William Henry Harrison, under instructions of President Jefferson, pushed his efforts to extinguish
                    the Indian title along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river below the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> river, and on August 16, 1804, by treaty, obtained title to all lands between the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> rivers south of the line from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Falls. In this treaty, the claims of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> tribes were recognized for all lands between White river and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river. It was not until fourteen years later, however, that the lands of the Delawares,
                    which embraced all of central Indiana as well as the southeastern part of the state, were ceded to
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. This treaty was effectd at St. Mary's, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, on October 2, 3 and 6, 1818. Then and there, the celebrated peace and friendship
                    treaties were made with the Pottawattomies, Delawares and Miamis, which opened up by its provisions
                    the state of Indiana for entry and settlement. The treaties were made between the tribes and
                    Jonathan Jennings, Lewis Cass, and Benjamin Parke, commissioners for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Attached to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> treaty are the signatures of thirteen representatives of the U. S., besides the three
                    commissioners, and seventeen <placeName>

                    </placeName> chiefs (by mark).</p>
            <p>So much, briefly, for the abstract of title to the Indian lands now comprised in Southeastern
                    Indiana, which territory we have designated in this study by imaginary lines drawn from our capital
                    city, directly eastward to the Indiana state line and southward to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river, and now for the relation of a few facts of the history-making in this territory
                    by its pioneers.</p>
            <p>Just what the home-coming program committee may have wished to have stressed in the assignment of
                    this topic was not intimated, and it is possible that some Phases of Southeastern Indiana History,
                    which should be included in such a discussion, will have been omitted. If so, we trust you will not
                    hesitate to call attention to them later. In treating this <pb n="40" id="VAA4025-020-1-042"/>
                    subject we have selected certain salient historical features and attempted to group them, somewhat,
                    and arrange all as nearly as possible in chronological order. Some of these phases are touched upon
                    so briefly that they might seem more appropriately labeled as glimpses of history, but which are,
                    nevertheless, essential in any general conception of the elements that have entered into the making
                    of this part of the state, a revival of which in our memory should be most wholesome and
                    inspirational in this home-coming program.</p>
            <p>1. At the outset, and in any adequate survey of the history of this section, we should take due
                    cognizance of the French explorations of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> valley and La Salle, the first white man in this region, and who probably traced the
                    entire lower boundary of Indiana in 1669—1670, by way of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river, passing through the northwest corner of the state in 1671 or 1672. While there
                    is no recorded exploration of Indiana following that period, it is argued that in that interval more
                    or less fur trading was carried on in this region.</p>
            <p>We must pay tribute to the courage and wisdom of Colonel George Rogers Clark, and take note of his
                    conquest of the Northwest Territory, whose second military base of operations was at the Falls of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and whose route to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country and Post <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> was from this base along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> westward. This base of operations was on a long, narrow island known as Corn Island,
                    that then lay above the Falls where the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> railroad bridge now spans the river. This island was then covered with timber, but the
                    timber was later removed and the island is now washed away. Reasons for that location were that it
                    furnished better protection from the Indians.</p>
            <p>It was gratifying to note, some two months since, an account of the dedication of a monument to
                    George Rogers Clark, erected near the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. While some local patriotic organizations had an active part in the placing of this
                    marker, it was due in part to the Indiana Historical commission. This body is charged under act of
                    the legislature, appropriating $15,000 for the purpose, with the task of placing such
                    historical tributes, and George Rogers Clark <pb n="41" id="VAA4025-020-1-043"/> was chosen first
                    because he is a national figure as well as a state hero. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> of June 24, 1922, stated that the marker was placed by the Ann Rogers Clark
                    chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the Indiana Sons of the Revolution, and the Indiana Historical commission. The
                    commission meets the cost of the tablet and the D. A. R. chapter, aided by its friends, is meeting
                    all other expenses, including provision of the stone, which weighs six tons and is of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> limestone standing in all six feet high.</p>
            <p>2. A phase of Southeastern Indiana History, which all will concede is of outstanding significance,
                    and preeminence, and of deep concern to every loyal Hoosier, is that pertaining to
                    Indiana's birthplace. For it was in southeastern Indiana, in Harrison county, at Old
                    Corydon, that the state of Indiana came into being, and Corydon, the county seat of Harrison county,
                    became the first state capital of Indiana. Much interest will ever center around this historical
                    land-mark.</p>
            <p>It was at Corydon, too, that the first constitution of Indiana was formed and adopted. It was here
                    that our first statesmen met and enacted many laws that were to govern a great people. It was here
                    that the foundation was laid for a state that was destined to produce many great men and women.</p>
            <p>William H. Roose, from whose valuable book <hi rend="i">Indiana's Birthplace</hi>, we have
                    secured much information, has enumerated a number of distinguished men who either lived in Corydon
                    or whose acquaintance extended into Harrison county in the early days, the most renowned of whom was
                    William Henry Harrison, the general, for whom Harrison county was named.</p>
            <p>William Henry Harrison was born in Berkely, <placeName>

                    Northwest territory. On May 13, 1800, he was appointed governor of Indiana territory. On January 10,
                    1801, he took charge of the office at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was then the territorial capital. He remained in charge of the executive
                    department of the territory until September, 1812, when he was appointed a brigadier general and
                    assigned to the command of the northwest frontier. He was <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-020-1-044"/> the

                    </placeName>. General Harrison, in 1807, entered a tract of land on Blue river. He there set out a
                    large apple orchard, some of the trees of which, it is said, are still standing to mark the spot
                    where a president of the <placeName>

                    among the early settlers far and near as "Bill" Harrison. [?]</p>
            <p>Names of others whose duties brought them to Harrison county, were Jonathan Jennings, president of
                    the constitutional convention and the first governor of Indiana, William H. Hendricks, secretary of
                    the convention, and, later, governor of Indiana, state treasurer, Samuel Merrill, secretary of
                    state, Robert A. New, and Judges Benjamin Parke, James Scott and John Johnson. Others mentioned were

            <p>Much has been recorded of the history of Old Corydon which must necessarily be excluded from a
                    discussion of limited scope, but we were interested to note in the accounts of public buildings
                    erected, in regard to the building of a stray pen, it was stated that the contract price of
                    $33.75 was proof that public graft was unknown in Harrison county in 1810, and that the
                    first squandering of public funds and accusation of public graft in Harrison county occurred while
                    Henry W. Heth was clerk. He was charged with giving away English quills to the school children. The
                    English quills were said to be much better than ordinary quills for pens. Mr. Heth's
                    extravagance, which caused the sensation, probably cost the county during a period of several years
                    as much as two dollars.</p>
            <p>A few of the important facts of this epochal period of our state's history, which are
                    inseparably connected with Indiana's birthplace, are as follows:</p>
            <p>By an act of the General Assembly of Indiana territory, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was approved on the 11th day of March, 1813, the seat of government of the
                    territory was fixed at <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-020-1-045"/> Corydon, Harrison county, "from
                    and after the first day of May, 1813."</p>
            <p>In conformity with a joint resolution of both houses of the General Assembly of the territory, Acting
                    Governor Gibson prorogued them to meet at Corydon on the first day of December, 1813.</p>
            <p>The General Assembly of Indiana territory which met at Corydon on the first Monday in December, 1815,
                    adopted a memorial which was presented to congress by the territorial delegate, Jonathan Jennings,
                    on the 28th day of the same month, providing that when there shall be 60,000 inhabitants therein the
                    territory shall be admitted to the Union on an equal footing with the original states. The senate
                    and house of representatives in congress were asked to order an election for representatives to meet
                    in convention at the seat of government of this territory to determine the advisability of going
                    into a state government. The memorial was referred to a committee of which Jonathan Jennings, the
                    delegate from Indiana territory, was the chairman; and on the 6th day of January, 1816, this
                    gentleman reported to the house of representatives, a bill to enable the people of Indiana territory
                    to form a constitution and state government, and for the admission of such state into the Union on
                    equal footing with the original states. This bill, after having been amended in some particulars,
                    was passed by congress and became a law by the approval of the president of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, on April 19, 1816.</p>
            <p>Almost two months later, on the 10th of June, 1816, those pioneer delegates met in convention at
                    Corydon, but rather than be seated in the commodious room of the capitol building, during the warm
                    June days, they betook themselves to the inviting shade of a huge elm tree near the banks of Big
                    Indian creek, where they drafted a Constitution for a state that was destined to become one of the
                    greatest commonwealths of the nation. Unquestionably there is no more honored and revered landmark
                    in the state today than this marvelous, old Constitutional Elm.</p>
            <p>In concluding this subdivision of the general topic, let us recall that the territorial government
                    was superseded by <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-020-1-046"/> a state government on the 7th of November,
                    1816, and the state of Indiana formally admitted to the Union, by a joint resolution of congress,
                    approved on December 11, 1816; and that Corydon remained the territorial and state capital from the
                    1st of December, 1813 until January 10, 1825.</p>
            <p>3. The Indian wars and General <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>, who participated so whole-heartedly and courageously in these wars, constitute a
                    portentious aspect of Southeastern Indian History.</p>
            <p>One factor in our Indian troubles from the beginning was the encouragement offered the savages by the
                    British in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> had never reconciled herself to the occupancy by the Americans of this territory
                    wrested from her by George Rogers Clark, and it is an established charge in our histories that even
                    during the period of peace between the nations, the Indians of the northwest received their arms and
                    ammunitions from our old time foe and were secretly backed up in their hostilities. When the brewing
                    troubles between America and <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> culminated in war in June, 1812, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> found ready allies among the red people, notwithstanding the fact that as late as May
                    of that year, at a grand council on the Mississinewa, the majority of the tribes professed a desire
                    for peace with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>While historical records, particularly <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>'s journals, note many terrifying experiences and skirmishes with the Indians
                    in this section of the state, by far the most ominous of these was that known as the Pigeon Roost
                    Massacre. In 1812 there were several attacks by the Indians on the numerous blockhouses which had
                    been erected for fortifications of the settlers, but usually the marauders would attack individuals
                    and sometimes families. What was known as the Pigeon Roost settlement consisted of several families
                    that made a little community in Clark, now Scott county. This settlement was confined to about a
                    square mile of territory and was separated from any other by several miles.</p>
            <p>On the afternoon of September 3, 1812, two men, Jeremiah Payne and Isaac Coffman, were out hunting
                    bee trees about two miles north of the Pigeon Roost settlement, when they were surprised by a band
                    of a dozen Shawnee [?] warriors, and both were killed and scalped. The Indians then, <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-020-1-047"/> about sunset, advanced upon the settlement, and within the space
                    of an hour murdered one man, five women and sixteen children and burned their cabins. Some of the
                    Clark county militiamen gathered at the scene of the massacre, found the dead in the smoking ruins,
                    gathered them together and burried them in a single grave.</p>
            <p>About 150 riflemen under the command of Major John McCoy, the next day, followed the trail of the
                    retreating savages northward for twenty miles to the Muscatatuck where were found some of the
                    straggling Indians. When the stragglers were discovered the officer in command ordered the bugle to
                    be sounded, whereupon the Shawnees took warning and escaped through the river bottoms in the thick
                    woods and underbrush and under the pursuit of the scouts. Mr. George Pence further relates that
                    Colonel <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName> was away from home at that time, much to the regret of the militiamen, else the pursuit
                    of the marauders might have had a different ending.</p>
            <p>Those who had made settlement elsewhere in this locality were in dread, even three months before the
                    Pigeon Roost affair. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>'s journal records that Capt. Zenor and himself "received letters from
                    a number of citizens" on the Driftwood fork of White river requesting them to
                    "come and fetch a company" to guard them from the Indians and partake of a dinner
                    on the Fourth of July, which protection they promptly rendered. He also gives an account of
                    assistance given the Vallonia settlement while engaged in harvesting their flax, on which occasion,
                    however, no Indians appeared.</p>
            <p>On April 24, 1813, Major <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>

                    Harrison and Clark counties, reported to Governor Gibson, acting governor of Indiana territory, who
                    had made inquiry as to his success, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    man, the product of a rude society, who by strong natural gifts came to the fore and asserted

                    He was the chief support of the family, and by repairing guns, splitting rails and working as a farm
                    hand he was enabled to purchase a farm of fifty acres in that county, and is said to have soon taken
                    rank as a leader of the law and order forces in his neighborhood. He joined General Harrison in the

                    fighter, due, in part, to the complete accounts of his exploits in that connection, as well as in

                    encouragement to become an Indian fighter.</p>
            <p>In regard to his "unconventional" spelling, it has been said that "he was
                    too busy with the affairs of men to read books. He held closely and consciously to his heart the
                    ideals of the community." But his lack of education seems to have been overcome, to some
                    extent, in his later life so that he was at no disadvantage in the <placeName>

                    commissioners, on February 15, 1821, and at the meeting of this body, on March 20, 1821, the name

            <p>On January 11, 1820, the legislature appointed a commission to locate the new capital for the state,

                    man of more than state-wide reputation. His boyhood and early manhood were spent in Corydon, while
                    it was Indiana's capital, but the valor and character and achievements of this intrepid
                    pioneer were recognized throughout southeastern Indiana and the state, and the qualities which he
                    possessed were typical of numerous other pioneers whose faith, hope, energy and idealism entered
                    into the founding of this great commonwealth. It is to be hoped that before a great while a memorial
                    may be placed in this vicinity, preferably as nearly as possible to the scene of the

                    </placeName> and one of the first west of the Allegheny mountains. It was crude in construction and
                    equipment but the first whistle sounded the death knell of the freight wagon, the flatboat and the
                    stage-coach, and, indeed, the beginning and completion of this road to <placeName>

            <p>However, this pioneer enterprise, most naturally, was attended with a great many difficulties. It is
                    said, that for four years, as a private corporation, it lay all but dormant, so far as actual
                    performance was concerned. The situation was complicated due to the proposed construction of two
                    other railroads in this part of the state; the <placeName>

                        <p>The State took up the work on the broad—gauge plan, and at once. In 1836, the

                            proceeded on the theory that the best was none too good and instead of using the plain strap

                            other officials, and distinguished citizens from far and near. A locomotive had been ordered

                            of earnings. Then the state took hold of its business again only to find itself burdened
                            more than ever with a "white elephant", and following that a transfer of
                            the road was made to a private company with the agreement that the latter should take up

            <p>The proprietorship of the M. &amp; I., at the time the road was completed, was dual, the state
                    and the company owning, respectively, the portions they had built, and the earnings were divided
                    according to mileage. This relationship lasted until 1852. The state then sold out its interests to
                    the company at a sacrifice, withdrew its protection and at once proceeded to the passage of a
                    general railroad law that opened the way to those rival lines that had been previously handicapped
                    by the denial of fair charters. The result was fatal to the M. &amp; I. The most formidable of

            <p>In pursuing this study of early railroads a bit farther we were interested to note some of the
                    nicknames of railroads and some facts in regard to early railroad equipment. For instance, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName> City branch of the J., M. &amp; I. was once called the Calico Road because the
                    workmen on it were paid in dry goods. Locomotives were once universally <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-020-1-054"/> named as steamboats are today, the "Gen. Morris",
                    "Reuben Wells’, "Dillard Rickets", etc., but illustrating the
                    old custom of doing honor to men of note in the railroad world. It has been stated that the two of
                    the most popular engines of the day on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    </placeName> railroad were the Chief and the Gazelle. The Chief carried a huge brass picture of an
                    Indian chief just below the engineer's seat, while on the other was a brass picture of the
                    Gazelle. It was the duty of the engineer to keep these pictures polished at all times.</p>
            <p>The locomotive in the earlier days had neither cowcatchers nor cab. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The innovation of a protecting cab was at first objected to by the men as a dangerous trap in
                            case of accident. The locomotive weighed from 10 to 13 tons, as against 75 to 100 tons of
                            today, and was capable of hauling 12 or 15 cars holding 3 tons each.</p>

            <p>As to speed: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>20 miles an hour for passenger trains was a high rate of speed. There is record, in 1840, of
                            an engine drawing 221 tons forty miles in 3 hours and 41 minutes. * * * * A not uncommon
                            occurrence was the stopping of trains till the train men went ahead with a
                            sledge—hammer to spike down rails. There were other causes of delay not down on
                            the schedules, among them being the stoppage at some wayside stream or pool to replenish the
                            water supply by dipping up with leathern buckets that were carried on hooks at the side of
                            the tender. It is a plausible guess that from this job of the trainmen, originated the
                            humoristic appellation of "jerk—water", so commonly applied to
                            cheap and out of date roads.</p>

                    </placeName>, one of the very oldest cities in the state of Indiana and for several years generally
                    conceded to be the first city of Indiana, first in commerce, population, wealth, literature, law,
                    religion, politics and social enjoyment. Throughout the forties the one railroad of the state, the <placeName>

                    </placeName> river traffic, and there <pb n="53" id="VAA4025-020-1-055"/> are stories current of the
                    large steamboats lying in rows along the wharves where the bags of wheat were piled high and the
                    warehouses were filled to their roofs with miscellaneous freight, while countless barrels of mess
                    pork packed for shipment to the south as far as the gulf, and to the east as far as Europe, occupied
                    all the river front and reached up into the by—streets. As a pork market it was second

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    month. Because of its importance as an entrepot it became known as the Gateway of the State.
                    However, while the unexcelled prosperity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    are still unparallelled throughout the state. And, we may add, the comparatively recent gift of one
                    of the rarest examples of this wonderful scenery, Clifty Falls Park, to the state is ample evidence
                    of the generosity and patriotsm of the citizens of this famed city of Jefferson county, and of the

            <p>(b) Interurban Railroad. In view of the unusual significance, historically, in southeastern Indiana
                    and the state, of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad, which was the first to be extended to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as well as the first railroad in the state, we are reminded of a more modern phase of
                    pioneer endeavor along transportation lines, for it was from southeastern Indiana that the first
                    Interurban electric car entered the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, twenty—three years ago. This new mode of transportation introduced into the
                    state has developed into one of the largest and most complete traction systems in the country. The
                    original road was from Greenwood to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but later its construction was extended through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> and to Seymour.</p>
            <p>This interurban line was built by the late Joseph I. Irwin and his son, William G. Irwin, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, after thorough examination of electric lines in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> operating near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At the time the first plans for the road were presented there was a decided opposition
                    to such a project and many business men declared pessimistically that such a business venture would
                    not succeed. The road, however, was built and <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-020-1-056"/> has met with
                    decided success, and its history is interesting.</p>
            <p>The first stretch of road bed between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Greenwood was made in 1899 and the first car ran between these two cities on
                    December 26 of that year, although it is recorded on some pages of history that this road ran the
                    first interurban car into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the 1st day of January, 1900. It is said that when the first car went into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> the residents of that city were amazed and astounded at the size of the electric car,
                    which was not so large as the city cars now operating in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There was no station erected when the line was put into operation and the Greenwood
                    car was run into the business district where it stood until the hour scheduled for its departure.
                    This car is still used by the Interstate Public Service company for the operation of the road, as a
                    gravel and line car, and is a wooden coach with a small baggage compartment and seating capacity
                    sufficient to accommodate only half of the number of passengers and amount of baggage carried by the
                    large all—steel cars now in use on the line.</p>
            <p>After operating between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Greenwood for a short time a demand arose for the extension of the line as far
                    south as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>

            <p>(c) The Underground Railroad. In continuance of the subject of transportation let us consider briefly
                    another most enterprising and somewhat dissimilar transportation project, the Underground Railroad,
                    some of the main branches and stations of which were located in this part of the state, and the
                    activities in connection with which stand out in relief in any review of the Phases of Southeastern

            <p>The Underground Railroad, a famous feature of the antislavery crusade for twenty years or more
                    preceding the Civil war was, as is well known, a system of transportation routes over which fugitive
                    slaves were secretly conveyed from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river boundary into <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, where they were safe from the slavery laws of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The stations were friendly homes where the fugitives were concealed until they could
                    be safely forwarded. The people most zealous in this risky humanitarian work were the Quakers, and
                    the most famous of the various routes was the one that traversed the chief <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> settlements in the eastern and southeastern part of the state. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName> was the most conspicuous antislavery center, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain</region>
                    </placeName> City, a few miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where lived Levi Coffin, the most active and persistent of the crusaders against
                    slavery, was the Union Station of the Underground Railroad.</p>
            <p>Hence the necessity for the many branches of this Underground Railroad in the country south of this
                    important center to convey the traffic northward from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river gateways. There were many places where the runaway negroes crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> into Indiana. However, this was one of the most difficult problems that the slave had
                    to solve, and to make that proposition easier it was agreed that there should be several places
                    located along the river where the negro could be crossed in boats and skiffs belonging to the
                    anti—slavery sympathizers.</p>
            <p>One of the most important regular crossing places on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> was near the mouth of Indian Creek, in Harrison county. There refugees were ferried
                    across, then conveyed to friends in Corydon who took them farther north across <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> county, the corners of Jackson and Jennings, through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur</region>
                    </placeName>, Rush and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> counties into <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, where they had an innumerable host of friends among the Quakers. They were then
                    piloted through western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and on to Lake Erie, and when a sufficient number had been gotten together they were
                    taken over to a point in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. It has been stated that probably more negroes crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> river at two or three places in front of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> than any place else from the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the reason being <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-020-1-058"/> that the three good sized cities
                    at the falls furnished good hiding places for the runaways among the colored people. Those crossing
                    at these places, also, were conveyed to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName> and thence to the lake.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> town of Azalia, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName>, was one of the most important stations of the Underground Railroad in the state, and
                    many interesting bits of history have been recorded of the assistance given by the people there in
                    harboring fugitive slaves, many of whom came to them destitute of clothing. The leaders in this
                    activity in that locality were John Hall, John Thomas and James Newson. On some occasions they
                    secreted the runaway slaves in the river bottoms and arranged with them to be at a certain stump
                    when the dinner bell rang when their dinners would be taken to them. Here they were guarded
                    carefully until they could be piloted safely northward, through East <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in the direction of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName> City R. R. to that city and on to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Union Stations. Often as many as a dozen or more slaves were brought from the
                    southern part of the state in covered wagons and cared for by the Friends in and around Azalia.
                    While all those who engaged in this work acted in direct violation of the laws of the country they
                    were actuated by a sincere conviction that they were obeying God's command to feed the
                    hungry and clothe the naked.</p>
            <p>An episode of the Civil war period, not connected with the above sub—division or the main
                    head under which it is classified, but which should unquestionably have mention In any consideration
                    of the general topic is that of Morgan's Raid. Morgan was an American military commander
                    and leader of a company of Confederate soldiers known as Morgan's Raiders, who figured in
                    many daring expeditions during the War of Secession. On July 7, 1863, he crossed the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The first town to be looted was Corydon, where stores were raided, the county treasury
                    robbed, private houses pillaged and horses stolen. From there the raiders proceeded northward to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>

            <p>4. Early Literary Life. The early literary life of southeastern Indiana centers about the pioneer
                    littérateur of our state, Edward Eggleston, to whom his brother, George Cary Eggleston,
                    has applied the epithet, "The First of the Hoosiers." He has reminded us that
                    Edward Eggleston was the <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>first to perceive and utilize in literature the picturesqueness of the Hoosier life and
                            character, the first to appreciate the poetic and romantic possibilities of that life and to
                            invite others to share with him his enjoyment of its humor and his admiration for its sturdy
                            manliness. Other men of rare literary gifts have followed in his footsteps in this richly
                            flowering field, but he was the first to venture upon it. He was the pathfinder. Until he
                            wrote <hi rend="i">The Hoosier Schoolmaster</hi>, and moved the readers of more than one
                            nation to laughter and tears, nobody had ever made the smallest attempt to turn the Hoosier
                            life and character to any artistic account.</p>

            <p>This distinguished novelist was born at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and lived from 1837 to 1902. He was largely self—educated, as
                    delicate health prevented his going to college, but he was a diligent student and acquired a wide
                    knowledge of French literature and some Greek. At the age of nineteen he entered the Methodist
                    ministry, and for ten years preached and sold Bibles, and traveled in <placeName>

                    </placeName> for his health and also engaged in such other pursuits as opportunity offered. Later,
                    he attracted attention by magazine articles and started his literary career in 1866, by becoming

                    </placeName>, and editor of Hearth and Home. From 1874—1879 he was pastor of the Church
                    of Christian Endeavor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>

            <p>In 1880 he retired to his home on Lake George, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and thereafter devoted himself wholly to literature. At this time southern Indiana had
                    come into prominence by his story <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-020-1-060"/> of <hi rend="i">The Hoosier
                        Schoolmaster</hi>, which first appeared in the Hearth and Home. This story was one of the
                    earliest examples of realistic fiction portraying manners and dialect, and was one of the most
                    popular books of the 19th century. Among his other novels are <hi rend="i">Hoosier School Boy, End
                        of the World, Mystery of Metropolisville and Roxy.</hi> He also published biographies of
                    American Indians for juveniles.</p>

                    mastery over young minds and sympathy for youthful thought and feeling. Edward Eggleston said of
                    her: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>As a school—master she deserves immortality. She loved the teaching profession.
                            Mrs. Dumont was the ideal of a teacher because she succeeded in forming character.</p>

                    </placeName> delegates, serving at that time three years and later in 1787—8 and in the

                    </placeName>, and it was no doubt due to his influence that his son was appointed on December 8,
                    1800, one of the judges of Indiana territory. He was then twenty-nine years of age, was of good
                    appearance and manners. He had spent some time abroad and had studied law.</p>
            <p>During the period from March 3, 1802, to the creation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> territory all of the present state of <placeName>

                    </placeName> was attached to Indiana so that Judge Griffin for three years exercised a nominal
                    jurisdiction over <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the adjacent <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-020-1-062"/> country, although in fact no
                    Indiana judge ever held court in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> people had no knowledge of or paid attention to any laws which the Indiana legislature
                    enacted.</p>
            <p>It was at Judge Griffin's own request that he was transferred as <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> judge from Indiana to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and a few years later he tried in vain to exchange his position in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> with Judge Stanley Griswold, then <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> judge in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> territory.</p>
            <p>Although appointed in December, 1805, it was not until September, 1806, that he first reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and took up his duties there.</p>
            <p>One of the first acts of the legislative board composed of the governor and judges was to incorporate
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> bank and in this institution Judge Griffin subscribed for ten shares. Stocks were
                    always a favorite form of investment of the judge and frequent references are made in the letters of
                    his contemporaries to his stock interests.</p>
            <p>In the differences which soon arose between Governor Hull and Judge Woodward, the sympathies and acts
                    of Judge Griffin were generally on the side of Woodward, and when Judge Witherell came on in the
                    place of Judge Bates, in nearly all cases a division found Woodward and Griffin on one side- Hull
                    and Witherell on the other.</p>
            <p>Conflict, however, was distasteful to him; he liked peace and quiet, but he was not afraid on
                    occasion to act independently and even in opposition to all the other members of the board. He has
                    left no written opinions in cases decided by the court of which he was a member, so the quality and
                    extent of his legal learning cannot now be determined.</p>
            <p>During his entire term of office in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Judge Griffin spent much of his time away from the territory. He first arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> in September, 1806, and the following spring he left for a trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, spending some time in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he responded to a toast at a Fourth of July celebration and did not return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> until the summer of 1808.</p>
            <p>In August, 1811, he left for an extended visit to his old home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to look after the affairs of his father who <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-020-1-063"/> had
                    died in December of the previous year at Yorktown, and returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the spring of 1812. After the surrender of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> he went east and came back to his official duties in the fall of 1814.</p>
            <p>With his associates he was legislated out of office by congress, which ended his official career,
                    February 1, 1824, but he did not remain in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> until that time, leaving for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he remained for the rest of his life, living quietly upon his small income from
                    investments in stocks.</p>
            <p>He had bought in 1816 a farm near <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>, being Private Claim 495, which had been for some time in the Knaggs family and of
                    which he retained the ownership until his death, and which was sold by his heirs in 1853.</p>
            <p>He died in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in July, 1849, leaving an estate of little more than $4,000.00, consisting
                    of bank stock and bonds; this was in addition to his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> land.</p>
            <p>In his position as judge he sometimes displayed independent judgment and firmness but in general he
                    was disposed to accept and follow the guidance of the stronger mind of Judge Woodward. Perhaps a
                    fair characterization of him is that of William Woodbridge, who said that he was a man of
                    respectable literary acquirements, of good taste and good manners, but with a mind lamentably
                inert.</p>

            </p>
            <p>One of the first things we want to know about a stranger in whom we are interested is what kind of a
                    house he lives in, as if the place where a man eats and sleeps and calls his home in some way
                    reflects the makeup of the man. And so, in thinking of the pioneer, we want to know in what sort of
                    a house he lived. It must be remembered that the pioneer of Indiana came into a country heavily
                    timbered, excepting a portion on the western border and a few prairies over the state, usually under
                    water. There was neither a railroad nor a canal, nor even a turnpike. He came into this wilderness
                    to make his home. Some of the earlier settlers came from comfortable homes, but most of them were of
                    moderate, or below moderate, means. Live stock that could be led or driven was brought with them.
                    But furniture and other goods that could not walk or travel by their own locomotion were left
                    behind. Only necessary implements were brought with them, among which were the rifle, the ax, the
                    broad-ax, the frow, and a few rude farming implements. Furniture and all other articles that could
                    be made of wood were disposed of before starting for the new home in the wilderness. Thus equipped,
                    what sort of a home could the pioneer build to shelter himself and his family?</p>
            <p>The simplest form of the pioneer home was the half-faced camp. This was built by cutting two forks
                    from sapplings and driving them into the ground a few feet apart and a few feet from a fallen tree.
                    A cross pole was then placed in these forks, and, with one end on the cross pole and the other upon
                    the fallen tree, poles were placed to form the framework of the roof. The roof was then completed by
                    piling brush upon the poles. The two ends were built up with logs and covered with mortar made of
                    mud. The side opposite the fallen tree <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-020-1-065"/> was left open. Here a
                    heap of logs was rolled up and fired, which served as a heating plant and also as a protection
                    against wild animals. Mother earth was the floor, and skins spread upon it served as beds, the
                    occupants lying with their feet to the fire and their heads to the fallen tree. Of course the roof
                    leaked, and in wet weather the daubing fell from the wall, but this home was only used until a
                    better could be provided, and, fortunately, it was usually built during the dry season of the fall,
                    and skins were procured in sufficient number to make a good inside lining and to close the opening
                    in front before bad weather came on. Thus the skins were dried and protected the family against the
                    weather at the same time. It was in an abode of this sort, near Little Pigeon creek, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> county, that the Lincoln family lived the first year of their sojourn in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Not all settlers, however, lived in this kind of a house. Very often a man would make a trip into the
                    wilderness, select his land and build a cabin, and then return to his home and bring his family the
                    next year. And, too, when he brought his family on the first trip, the family sometimes lived in the
                    wagon, which was covered, until the cabin was built.</p>
            <p>The cabin was constructed of logs, the straightest to be found, ten or twelve inches in diameter, and
                    twelve to eighteen or sometimes twenty feet long. Maple, ash, beech and poplar were used. The logs
                    were notched at each end to fit over the logs of the adjacent side. Sometimes the bark was peeled
                    off, quite often it was left on. Poles were used for rafters and also for cross pieces, upon which
                    were placed clapboards, rived from the oak timber of the surrounding forest. The cabin was built
                    without the use of nails, the clapboard roof being held on by means of weight poles. The space
                    between the logs was filled with chinks, short pieces of timber, and daubed with mud. The mud did
                    not stick very well and sometimes fell out in great chunks, especially in rainy weather.</p>
            <p>At one end of the cabin an opening was made for the fireplace. The foundation of the fireplace was
                    clay pounded solid with a maul. The chimney was a log pen built around the opening several logs
                    high, well mortared, and finished out with sticks and mortar. Straw or grass was often mixed with
                    the <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-020-1-066"/> mud mortar to make it hold better. The straw made the
                    chimney more dangerous for fire. An elderly lady whose father settled in Adams county in 1836 told
                    me that they always looked up the chimney before retiring to see if any straw was on fire. If they
                    saw any sparks they threw a cup of water up the chimney to put them out.</p>
            <p>Glass being hard to get, the window was often covered with greased paper. A deer or bear skin often
                    covered the opening left for a door. Wooden doors were hung on leather hinges. In one cabin the door
                    was hung on bacon rinds, which after being gnawed off by the dogs, were replaced with wooden hinges.</p>
            <p>But let us not judge too critically of the quality of the man from these first abodes of the first
                    settlers. The cabins they built were the product of circumstances rather than an indication of the
                    caliber of the builder. They wrought as best they could under the conditions. Most of the settlers
                    were not content to live very long in this round-log cabin with dirt, or at best puncheon, floor and
                    stick chimney. After the pioneer got settled and had cleared off a few acres for crops, he began
                    selecting the straightest and best trees in his woods for the erection of a hewed-log house. The
                    logs were hewed on at least two sides, sometimes on four sides, making a tolerably smooth wall. The
                    space between the logs was carefully chinked and plastered with lime and sand. There were sometimes
                    two rooms below, and always an upstairs. The floors were made of sawed lumber. There was a brick
                    chimney with a brick or stone hearth. The door jambs and window casings were made of walnut or
                    poplar. The roof was made of shingles if they were available, if not, of clapboards carefully rived
                    and nailed on. Instead of the door pin in the old log house, there was the latch-and-string which
                    consisted of a wooden latch on the inside of the door with a leather string attached and running
                    through a hole in the door to the outside. To lock the door at night one simply pulled the string
                    in. This was a very convenient way of latching the door as long as the latch worked freely. But if
                    the latch stuck when one was on the outside there was danger of breaking the string, leaving oneself
                    locked out.</p>
            <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-020-1-067"/>
            <p>The hewed-log house was usually placed a few feet from the first round-log cabin, and the space
                    between them was roofed and partly or wholly inclosed, making an extra room. This space between the
                    houses was called the entry, because through it one entered either log house. In summer this was the
                    coolest place to be found. This entry on many a Sunday afternoon served as a meetinghouse where the
                    neighbors, which included everybody who lived within ten or even more miles, gathered for devotional
                    services. When the family moved into the new hewed-log house the old log cabin was used for a
                    kitchen and dining room. The new hewed-log was the parlor, sitting room, and bed room.</p>
            <p>There were two types of settlers. One came for the love of adventure and subsisted by hunting and
                    fishing. The other came to get a home where he and his children might have a better chance to gain a
                    competency. The first built a makeshift cabin and as soon as game became a little scarce, sold out
                    to some one more enterprising and moved on to newer territory. Some did not have enough ambition to
                    move on but lived and died in their first log cabin, sometimes in poverty. The other type came to
                    stay, and built substantially, as is evidenced by the old hewed-log houses yet standing.</p>
            <p>The furniture in the primitive home was of the rudest kind, made by placing two posts a few feet from
                    the wall and connecting these posts with the wall by means of cross poles upon which hewn boards
                    were placed for a top. The bed was made in a similar manner by driving a post the proper distance
                    from a corner of the cabin with cross poles from the post to the two walls. Upon this framework
                    poles or boards were placed and covered with leaves or straw. Stools and benches of as rude a nature
                    answered the purpose of chairs. The back-log, until it was needed for its ultimate purpose in the
                    fireplace, was used as a bench.</p>
            <p>But many of these early settlers were handy with tools, and as soon as they were settled and had
                    time, made better and often somewhat artistic furniture. My grandfather was a sturdy <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Dutchman. By trade he was a cooper. In 1838 he settled in Adams county about two miles
                    southwest of the point where Limberlost creek flows into the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-020-1-068"/> This part of the state was at that time covered
                    with heavy oak, beech, walnut, poplar, maple, ash, elm, sycamore, and varieties of smaller timber.
                    He made some beautiful buckets by alternating the staves with ash and walnut or wild cherry. His
                    buildings were of a very substantial type. The round log house which he first built was used for
                    more than fifty years. The hewed-log, built a few years later, is still standing. The brick chimney
                    is still intact. The old well house, which is also hewed-log, is still standing.</p>

            </p>
            <p>For a long time after the first settlers came to Indiana there was not a railroad nor a canal in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and not a turnpike in Indiana. Most of the traveling was done on foot or horseback.
                    The roads were only horse paths, and the traveler was guided by blazed trees and quite frequently
                    lost his way. Of course the settlers did little real traveling after they were once settled in their
                    new homes. A neighborhood included all the country within a radius of ten or fifteen miles. Going
                    from one place to another in the same neighborhood was not considered traveling. If the whole family
                    went, as they usually did to social gatherings, such as log rollings, sheep shearings, corn
                    huskings, house raisings, and religious meetings, the father mounted the horse with the larger
                    children in front, and the mother, with the smaller children behind. If the distance was only a few
                    miles, it was often made on foot.</p>
            <p>The greatest distance traveled by most settlers was in going to mill. The flour mills were located
                    along the streams where water power could be used. Settlers often lived more than thirty miles from
                    any flour mill. It took at least one day to cover this distance, and if the roads were bad, as they
                    were most of the year, it took longer than a day. After reaching the mill, the settler had to wait
                    his turn, and in all it sometimes took several days to go to mill and return home again. Often the
                    settler was exposed to much discomfort on these trips. The weather might be mild on his departure
                    from home, and before nightfall a sudden change might make traveling a great hardship. The following
                    story is told of <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-020-1-069"/> James Snow, who lived in the Salamonia region.
                    Mr. Snow was out of tobacco and, desiring to purchase some, started from his home in the morning for
                    Camden about ten miles distant, to purchase a supply. It was winter, and clouds obscured the sun.
                    The weather changed to colder. He reached Camden and made his purchase and started on his return
                    trip. The snow was falling thickly, and the trace was hard to follow. Nightfall came. He lost his
                    way and started back. But he could not find his way back. He wandered here and there, in vain trying
                    to find the way. He was becoming much fatigued but knew if he lay down he would perish before
                    morning. He got between two trees and kept moving from one to the other, resting at intervals by
                    leaning first against one tree and then the other, and in this way held out until a searching party
                    rescued him the next morning.</p>
            <p>There were two classes of citizens in that day who did quite a lot of traveling. These were the
                    preachers and the lawyers. There were few local preachers. Most of them had circuits which they made
                    more or less regularly. This gave them the name of circuit riders or itinerants. They were poorly
                    paid, seldom getting over $200 per year and more often less than $100 per
                    year. Much that was promised was never paid. But they were usually treated very hospitably not only
                    by the members of their own church but by the settlers generally. Two ministers on their return trip
                    from a camp meeting at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> were lost. They came to a fork in the path. The atmosphere in the one direction smelt
                    swampy. They took the other path and soon came to a clearing. It was then dark. They gave the usual
                    "hullow," whose meaning every settler knew. A typical backwoods Hoosier lady came
                    to the door. "Well, who be you? What's wanting?"
                    The men stated their case. They wanted food and lodging. The lady advised them to go two miles
                    farther on to an inn where they would get "mighty good accommodashuns." The men
                    protested that they had been lost all day and that they would lose their way again in the dark and
                    that they had had nothing to eat since the evening before. She finally told them they might stay
                    over night, but that they would have to sleep on the floor because the only bed they had was all
                    taken up by herself and <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-020-1-070"/> the children, and that she could not
                    give them food because they were out of corn meal and would not have any until the husband went to
                    mill and got some cracked, which he intended to do on the morrow. They took the lodging without the
                    food. They spread their horse blankets on the floor and used their saddles for pillows. But the
                    creaking of the bed upon which the children rolled and tumbled, now and then kicking each other in
                    the side, the hardness of the floor, and the dry hickory-nut odor from the hogs sleeping beneath,
                    all combined to banish repose. At dawn they arose, offered the lady pay for their lodging, which was
                    refused, and started for the inn two miles farther on where they found the "mighty good
                    accommodashuns" mentioned by their hostess of the night before.</p>
            <p>The other class of travelers were the lawyers who traveled on horseback from one court to another,
                    which were often many miles apart. Every itinerant attorney, and at this time all were itinerant,
                    traveled on horseback, as did most people who were passing through the country for one purpose or
                    another. Evidence of this mode of travel is seen in the following advertisement in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Journal</hi>, Tuesday, January 10, 1826: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Although the accommodations were very primitive, most of the inn keepers tried to meet the needs of
                    the travelers in an efficient manner. O. H. Smith, in his <hi rend="i">Early Trials and
                    Sketches</hi> tells us that Captain John Berry prided himself in trying to make his tavern in
                    Andersontown (now Anderson) especially accommodating to travelers. He even made a trip to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and "put up" at the Astor House to get pointers on the best way to
                    run a hotel. When he went to the dining room he said they handed him his bill before bringing him
                    anything to eat. The waiter asked him what he would have to drink. He replied,
                    "tea."</p>
            <p>"What kind of tea?"</p>
            <p>"Store tea, of course."</p>
            <p>On Sunday morning he strolled down Broad Way. Passing a church while the organ was playing, someone
                    invited him to come in. He replied that he didn't dance, and, if he did, he
                    wouldn't dance on Sunday.</p>
            <p>A party of itinerant attorneys were stopping at Captain Berry's hotel. Among them was O. H.
                    Smith, Judge James Whitcomb, and others. Judge Whitcomb was very fastidious. He changed shirts every
                    day, was very critical of his own personal appearance, and always slept in a night shirt, a habit
                    many very upward looking people in that day had not learned. One of the attorneys, a fast friend of
                    Captain Berry's, was <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-020-1-072"/> given to pulling jokes on the
                    other attorneys. One morning he called Captain Berry aside and asked him if he had heard what Judge
                    Whitcomb had said about his beds. No, he had not. "Well," said the attorney,
                    "Judge Whitcomb says your beds are so dirty he has to take off his day shirt and put on a
                    dirty one to sleep in." That, of course, roiled Captain Berry. He had prided himself on
                    having the cleanest hotel in the state, and now to hear that the cleanest man in the state said his
                    beds were dirty was more than the Captain could endure. It was arranged that the Captain should
                    watch that night and see for himself. When the Judge went to his room to retire the Captain followed
                    and peeped through an opening in the door. Sure enough, the judge was taking off his day shirt and
                    making ready to put on another. The Captain pounced upon the judge and, had it not been for the
                    intervention of the other attorneys, would have thrown him out bodily. It was finally explained to
                    the Captain that it was only a joke, and he humbly apologized to the judge.</p>
            <p>O. H. Smith also narrates another trip that he and two other attorneys made which throws light upon
                    the hardships of travel in those days and also upon the hospitality of the settlers. Smith and Judge
                    Miles C. Eggleston started from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the morning and were joined by James Rariden at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They were headed for Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> where court was to convene on the next Monday. It was in the fall of 1825, and, being
                    the dry season of the year, the roads were very good. They reached Winchester the first night and
                    put up at Paul Way's hotel. The next morning they set out through the wilderness. It was
                    hot and dry. They could find water neither for themselves nor for their horses. About one
                    o'clock they reached the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> river which was almost dried up. But there was grass on the banks, and they stopped
                    here to rest and graze their horses. Saddles, saddle bags, and blankets were taken off the horses.
                    It was a question whether they should hold the horses, tie them to sapplings, or turn them loose. It
                    was decided that there was no danger of their running away and that it would be better for
                    themselves and the horses to turn them loose. They took the bridles off and turned the horses loose.
                    They grazed for a few minutes when <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-020-1-073"/> one stuck his nose in the air
                    and gallopped as fast as he could back over the road he had just traveled. The other two horses did
                    likewise, and the three men were left in the wilderness far from habitation, with no means of
                    conveyance excepting their own legs. It was known that there was a cabin on Townsend's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> about ten miles farther on. They hung their saddles and blankets in a tree high enough
                    that the wolves could not reach them, threw their saddle bags over their backs, and started for the
                    cabin on Townsend's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The heat was intense, and none of them was used to walking. Near evening dark clouds
                    gathered in the west, thunder rolled, and lightning pierced the sky. Worn almost to exhaustion, they
                    reached Thompson's cabin on Townsend's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> just in time to escape the downpouring rain. Thompson's cabin was low, about
                    twenty feet square, covered with clapboards, and had no loft. The men had had nothing to eat since
                    breakfast at Paul Way's hotel in Winchester. The supper that Mrs. Thompson prepared for
                    them consisted of three articles: boiled squirrel, corn dodger, and sassafras tea. The men ate
                    heartily and soon after supper "turned in." The next morning their saddles and
                    blankets were brought to them from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and Mr. Thompson provided them with ponies and they reached Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> that evening. Their horses were taken up at Fort Defiance, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and returned to them at Winchester on their way home.</p>
            <p>As soon as wagon roads were opened up over the country stage coaches appeared. But traveling by stage
                    was often much worse and slower than by horseback. In 1837 Thomas Goodwin, a Methodist minister,
                    then going to Asbury College, started from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> by stage for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> too late for the stage west and had to lay over a day in the capital. He took the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Limited Stage at ten o'clock that night and arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plainfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> in time for breakfast the next morning, having traveled a distance of fourteen miles.
                    They had not gone far on this fourteen miles when the stage stuck in the mud. The passengers were
                    requested to get out and get fence rails and pry the stage coach out of the mud. They obeyed. After
                    getting out of that mud hole, the driver told the passengers that they had better carry <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-020-1-074"/> the rails on down the road with them, because they would need them

            <p>There was very little danger in traveling by stage, yet there were a few accidents, usually due to
                    drunken drivers or fractious horses. The following appeared in the Indiana Journal, December 1,
                    1830: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            coach in which Judge Test, representative in congress, and his lady were on their way to <placeName>

            <p>A great deal of travel, as well as transportation, was carried on by use of the rivers. It was easy
                    to drop down stream in a boat or on a raft, but it was another matter to get back up again. Keel
                    boats made the trip from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> in five weeks, but the return trip took three or four months. The invention of the
                    steam boat overcame many of the difficulties of river navigation. As early as 1811 a steam boat made
                    the trip from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> in fourteen days but did not come back up again. The steam boat greatly stimulated the
                    industrial growth of that section of Indiana adjacent to the <placeName>

            <p>After being accustomed to such slow travel, can we wonder that the people marveled at the speed
                    claimed for rail road trains when they began to be talked of? The Indiana Journal, June
                    6, 1826, says: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>O. H. Smith relates that in 1826 he and Hon. John Test were candidates for congress from the same

            <p>Communication was even slower than travel. There was no telegraph, no telephone, no mail trains, and
                    anyone who would have dared to suggest the radio would have been declared insane and sent to a
                    lunatic asylum. The mail was carried on horse back, and the interval between mails was not less than
                    a week and often more than two weeks, when the mails were regular. The following taken from the
                    Indiana Journal December 26, 1826, will give some idea of the mail service:</p>

            <p>Postage was high, compared with what it is today, and was paid by the person receiving the letter.
                    The postage on a single letter, a letter of one sheet of paper, was six cents for a distance of
                    thirty miles, twelve cents for a double letter, one of two sheets, increasing with each additional
                    sheel and also increasing with the distance. Money was scarce, and this accounts for the long list
                    of letters advertised in each issue of the newspaper. It is said that Henry Ward Beecher, while
                    holding a meeting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, left a letter in the post office more than a week because he did not have the money to
                    pay the postage. Postage stamps were not used by the government until 1847, and it was not until
                    1857 that the sender paid the postage.</p>

                    pheasants, quails, and squirrels, and it did not require any great ability as a hunter to keep the
                    family well <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-020-1-078"/> supplied with meat. There was also plenty of
                    sassafras root and spice bark which was used for tea. Maple and sugar trees furnished sugar and
                    molasses. There was plenty of pasture in the woods during the summer for the cattle, and the hogs
                    fattened on mast during the fall. But bread would not grow on the bushes, although it was sometimes
                    almost made to grow among the bushes. The land was heavily timbered, and to clear it for crops was
                    an arduous task. Timber was of no value, because there was no market for it. Everybody had more than
                    was needed, and it couldn't be transported to parts of the world where it was needed. So
                    the settler had to get rid of it by cutting it off and burning it up. The underbrush and small
                    timber were cut off and burned, and the larger trees were deadened by cutting through the bark
                    entirely around the tree. When this was done the tree would die and decay. Among these deadened
                    trees the settler often planted his crop of corn, pumpkins, beans, potatoes, cucumbers, squashes,
                    sweet potatoes, and melons. The pumpkins and squashes were saved for winter use by slicing and
                    stringing and hanging up in the cabin to dry. A garden spot was kept near the cabin where all sorts
                    of garden stuff were raised. The home grounds were beautified with the morning glory, the hollyhock,
                    creeping ivy and other flowers. An orchard was planted, and more land was cleared.</p>
            <p>Most of the bread used was corn bread, not because the people liked it better than they did wheat
                    bread, but because corn meal was more easily prepared than was wheat flour. The wheat raised by the
                    settler was of poor quality. It often had smut and "wheat sick" and did not make
                    good bread. The wheat was thrashed by tramping it out, sometimes by horses, and there was no
                    effective way of separating the dirt from the wheat, and dirt and wheat were ground together. On the
                    other hand, the corn was of the best quality and could be grown even under adverse conditions. The
                    best corn could be selected for bread and was hand shelled, and the dirt and bad grains were
                    discarded. It could also be cracked or grated in the home, and save the weary journey to mill. Corn
                    meal was also much cheaper than wheat flour, and as cash was scarce, this was a strong argument in
                    favor of using corn meal.</p>

            <p>The early settler supplied most of his needs on his own homestead. He had cattle, sheep, hogs, and
                    poultry. The cattle furnished milk and butter, the sheep furnished wool out of which the mother spun
                    yarn and wove cloth for clothing, and the flax grown on the fields furnished linen. Grain was not
                    grown for sale because the market was only local and very limited, and the price was very low, as is

            <p>Few towns had warehouses where grain was bought and sold. Corn, the staple product, could not be
                    hauled very far for the price paid. Consequently the farmer fed his corn to hogs because the hogs
                    could walk to market. The big markets were at the river towns where the products could be carried
                    down the river in boats to <placeName>

                    </placeName> than from all the rest of the country. The breed of hogs raised was the razorback or
                    elm-peeler strain. Today they would not be given room on any farm. Better breeds were advocated and
                    actually introduced by a few forward looking farmers, but the innovation was viewed with suspicion
                    by the great majority of those who called themselves farmers. Each farmer had his own mark, a
                    peculiar slit in the ear, and the hogs were let run wild in the woods until after the mast was gone.
                    Then they were rounded up, a task that sometimes took days or weeks to do, so wild had the hogs
                    become. Then their fattening was finished on corn. Then began the weary wending of the swinish herds
                    toward the great markets on the <placeName>

            <p>Up until 1840 the price of hogs on foot never got above two cents per pound, and was often much less.
                    Other products were also cheap. Cattle ranged from one and a half to three cents per pound. A
                    dressed deer often sold for two dollars. A yoke of oxen could be bought for twenty-five dollars.
                    Sheep sold for about one dollar per head. Flax seed was worth 50 cents per bushel, corn, 10 to 15
                    cents. Horses ranged in price from ten dollars to fifty dollars. An extra good saddle horse might
                    bring more. On July 3, 1828 the <hi rend="i">Indiana Journal</hi> gave the following market report:

            <p>Industries in the inland towns were of a decidedly local nature, and the extent of their operation

                    were a legal tender and were taken in exchange for almost everything the pioneer needed. They were
                    not bulky nor heavy and were not perishable and could easily be transported. There was a great deal
                    of ginseng in the woods which was gathered and <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-020-1-084"/> sold to local

                    part cash for deliveries of fifty pounds or more. Salt was needed in quantity and was high because
                    of the difficulty of transportation. Whiskey was plentiful, there being no restriction on its
                    manufacture, and could be bought for twenty to thirty cents per gallon. Merchants kept for sale
                    copper stills, and people made whiskey for sale and for their own use. There was so much whiskey in
                    the country that the market was usually overstocked. The following recipe for putting up pickles
                    would lead us to believe that whiskey was cheaper than cider:</p>

                            a board on top of jar over the flannel cloth, and a stone on top of the board. No salt nor
                            anything else but just whiskey and water. When the jar is opened for use the pickles are
                            found to be solid and crisp with a good flavor and the same color as when taken from the
                            vine. After the pickles are taken out the whiskey and water makes good vinegar. I have no
                            doubt but vinegar for all purposes might be made in this way cheaper than from cider.</p>

                    their dishonesty was held up to the public by a write-up in the newspaper. The following is part of

                            and malicious libel upon my character, making many assertions and cautioning the public to
                            beware of me.</p>

                            responsibility), that the author of them is a base and infamous liar, scoundrel and knave.
                            Let this suffice for an introduction to his character: He married a wife in the state of <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                            </placeName>, and after living with her some time, he decamped and left her in the town of
                            Black Rock, a victim of his villainy. From that place he went to <placeName>

                            </placeName>, and brought from that state another wife to this city. He remained here long
                            enough to be guilty of the most base conduct, and decamped May 30th, leaving his wife
                            behind; she has now followed him to <placeName>

                            </placeName>. Where next he will attempt his villainy, I know not. His occupation until

                            shows; since then he has practiced dentistry. His manner is insinuating and calculated to

            <p>Although the pioneers endured many hardships and privations, they, nevertheless, enjoyed themselves
                    in many social gatherings quite as much as do the members of modern society. There was no snobbery,
                    no fictitious affectations, all were on a social equality. There were house-raisings, logrollings,
                    corn-huskings, goose-pickings, sheep-shearings, quilting bees, spelling matches, singing schools,
                    and shooting matches. As soon as the timber was prepared for the cabin, the neighbors came in and
                    helped to raise it. When the logs in the clearing were cut or niggared into the proper lengths, the
                    neighbors came and helped roll them into heaps. At the log-rollings the men were divided into two
                    groups, and the work was divided into two parts as nearly equal as possible, and then the race began
                    to see which group could finish first. While the men were rolling the logs the women were preparing
                    dinner. Such a feast kings never sat down to. There was meat of all kinds, venison, wild turkey,
                    chicken, sometimes bear, with pot pie and dumplings galore. There was pie, and cake, and all the
                    accessories, including hard cider and whiskey. At the corn-huskings, when a fellow found a red ear
                    he got to kiss the prettiest girl there. After the cornhusking there was always a dance. At these
                    gatherings political questions were discussed by the voters. The following was taken from the <hi rend="i">Indiana Journal</hi>, May 29, 1827: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            25th inst., at a goose-picking near the Frog Pond, 24 of us old clod-hoppers being convened
                            together, concluded to try the strength of the company, on the following question: whether
                            it was better to employ two or three men in the county, to dictate to the people how they
                            should vote, or that every free man should vote as he pleased? When the vote
                            stood as follows: For dictators, 2, for every man voting as he pleases, 22. The rest stood
                            neutral to see which way the wind blew. There is, however, something so disgusting and so
                            cringing in receiving the dictatorship of these demagogues who have no end to gratify but
                            their own ambition, that the people near the Frog Pond are determined to defend every
                            encroachment of their liberties.</p>

                        <p>P. S. At a sheep-shearing near the Buzzard Roost, the question came up, whether a
                            representative ought to be appointed by a few officious salaried officers or by the
                            people? and unanimously determined in favor of the latter—no one
                            voting on the opposite side, except those personally interested.</p>
                        <p>This shows the falsity of the report that the people want two or three men to elect their
                            representatives.</p>

            <p>One of the greatest events of the year was the camp meeting which was held in the autumn during the
                    dry season, after the crops were laid by and the wheat and oats harvested.. The roads at that season
                    of the year were usually good, and people came in covered wagons, on horse back, and on foot. They
                    often came as much as forty miles to these meetings, which lasted a week or ten days. Those coming
                    from a distance camped on the grounds. James Flint, in <hi rend="i">Readings in Indiana
                    History</hi>, describes a Wesleyan Methodist camp meeting in the following manner: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The preacher occupied a platform above the level of the audience. In front of the
                            speaker's platform was an inclosure for those seeking salvation. Trees were felled
                            for seats for the audience, and the males and females were separated by a rail fence. If one
                            got on the wrong side he was asked to climb the fence. In the inclosure for the seekers
                            there was great commotion. Some were shouting, leaping, jerking; others were moaning,
                            praying, and swooning; all of which was intermingled with loud "Amens".
                            Some swooned away and were carried into the tents. A short interval was allowed for dinner,
                            and in the afternoon they proceeded with a fresh speaker, and likewise again in the
                        evening.</p>

            <p>The fourth of July never passed without appropriate observance. The Declaration of Independence was
                    always read, and some prominent citizen made a speech. On one occasion a zealous advocate of General
                    Jackson's administration stepped into a church where the Fourth of July services were being
                    held just as the reader had reached that part of the Declaration which sets forth the usurpations of
                    the king. He listened with anger for a time, but when the reader read <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p rend="center">SCHOOLS</p>
            <p>Many of the pioneers were educated and desired to educate their children. But there were grave
                    obstacles in the new country to the progress of education. The sparsely settled country, the
                    impassable roads at times of the year, the danger of sending children through a forest infested with
                    wild animals, the lack of money, and the hard labor necessary to provide a home and the necessities
                    of life, almost eliminated schools from the pioneer's program. Although the state
                    constitution made provision for education, no general system of schools supported by taxation was
                    inaugurated for many years after the first settlers arrived. Subscription schools were organized,
                    usually for three months during the summer. But these were not general and were voluntary, and not
                    all the children of any community attended. The subscription price per pupil for three months varied
                    from $1.25 to $2.50, and the number of pupils, scholars, as they were then
                    called, varied from 20 to 40, making the teacher a salary of about fifty cents per day, sometimes
                    less. In addition to this remuneration, the teacher boarded among the patrons, going from one patron
                    to another and staying according to the number of scholars in the family.</p>
            <p>The first school house in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was built in 1821 near a large pond at the corner of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    there was no school the sheep got in through the chimney. The following extracts from newspapers of
                    that day give an idea of the desire for education: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>In 1823 the Presbyterian church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> built a new meeting house by subscription and provided a room for a day school. Other
                    churches also provided schools, but the Presbyterians are said to have had the best schools, and the
                    Methodists, the best preachers. Indiana university was established by the state at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1820. For half a century it struggled for existence. The different denominations of
                    churches felt agrieved, each because it was not given control over the school, and established
                    colleges under their own control, such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> college, under the Baptists; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> college, under the Presbyterians; and Asbury university, under the Methodists. In 1825
                    Robert Owen purchased the Rappite lands at Harmony and established his colony of Communists. The
                    town was now called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Owen established a school in connection with this colony, and for a few years this was
                    a center of art and learning. Many students were there from Europe and some from Mexico. The boys
                    delighted in playing pranks just as students do today. Dueling, although prohibited in Indiana, was
                    resorted to in most of the states. A Swiss named Baltazzer was a student in the school. He was very
                    unpopular with the boys. He had a quarrel with another scholar named Mike Craddock. The Swiss sent
                    Craddock a challenge to fight <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-020-1-091"/> a duel which challenge was
                    accepted. The time and place were agreed upon and the second chosen. When the time arrived the
                    parties met at the designated place. The distance was measured off, the pistols were examined and
                    loaded and handed to the principals. The signal to fire was given by dropping a handkerchief. Both
                    fired at the same time. The Swiss was unhurt. Craddock staggered, dropped his pistol, clasped his
                    hand over his heart and fell. The seconds ran up, opened his coat, examined his heart, and
                    pronounced him dead. The Swiss was distracted at what he had done. He pawed the air and cried,
                    "For God's sake send for a doctor." After letting the Swiss rave for a
                    time, Craddock sprang to his feet and burst out laughing. The Swiss then realized that he was the
                    victim of a practical joke. It had been previously arranged, with Craddock's knowledge,
                    that blank cartridges should be used. The boys teased the Swiss so much about this duel that he left
                    the school and went back to Europe, as he said, "to the company of gentlemen."</p>
            <p rend="center">Towns and Cities</p>
            <p>The first settlements in Indiana were made along the rivers and streams. The reason for this was
                    because travel was much easier on water than on land, and because the streams afforded water power
                    for the mills and an outlet for the products of the country. Accordingly we find the most important

            <p>In 1820 the committee appointed to select a place for the capital of the state selected the present

                    </placeName>. The federal government donated four sections for the capital. The capital was at that

                    the much needed corn meal, is not known. But when he got back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> no one qualified to tie the knot could be found. Can you imagine <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> without a marrying squire? After a few weeks a minister was found, and the
                    couple was married. This was the first wedding in <placeName>

            <p>In 1824 the population of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was only 600. The capital had not yet arrived. But in November of that year, Samuel
                    Merrill moved it from Corydon to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in wagons. It took five days to make the trip and cost $65. The coming of
                    the capital helped some, but not as much as had been expected. While the legislature was in session
                    the town <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-020-1-093"/> livened up a little but dropped back as soon as the
                    session closed. In 1827 the population was about 1000. The capital of Indiana was only a village,
                    with hogs, cattle, and sheep running at large through the principal streets. Futile attempts had
                    been made to incorporate the town, and it was not until 1832 that the incorporation of the town was
                    accomplished. One of the first ordinances passed placed a tax of fifty cents per head upon hogs
                    running at large. In those days a family without a dog was not well equipped, but two dogs were one
                    too many, and a tax of fifty cents per head was placed upon all dogs above one owned by a family. A
                    person leaving a cellar door open upon the street should be fined one dollar. Anyone leaving a team
                    unfastened in the street without unhitching the trace chains should be fined not to exceed three
                    dollars. The first speed ordinance was passed at that time. Anyone running or galloping a horse
                    through the alleys or streets should be fined not to exceed three dollars. Likewise the fine for
                    firing a pistol or flying a kite, or leaving firewood on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> street more than twelve hours, was not more than three dollars. The market master got a
                    salary of thirty dollars per year, and the market was open two hours on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
                    And thus began the capital city of the best state in the Union.</p>

                        <p>Belmont County has for the past few days been the scene of a great deal of
                                    excitement, consequent on the unpleasantly near approach of John Morgan to her
                                        borders.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> You are aware that some time since Morgan and his
                                    marauding band crossed over into Indiana and after raiding arround in that state for
                                    awhile came over to pay a visit to the "Buckeye" State. He crossed
                                    over at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                                    </placeName> Co. and after being hotly pursuid on all sides and having a good
                                    portion of his force killed and captured in the Southern County he directed his
                                    course northward. It was evident that he found himself entrapped and was seeking an
                                    outlet by way of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> river. On last Thursday night our Citizens were aroused and alarmed at
                                    a late hour by the ringing of the Court-House bell. Word had come that Morgan was in
                                    Guernsey Co. and was heading towards Belmont and it was not long before the whole
                                    town was in a perfect "furor" of excitement. A meeting was called
                                    to determine what to do. As the Governor had not called out the Malitia of this Co.
                                    and we were perfectly defenseless. Before this however the Military Committee had
                                    dispatched to Tod, knowing of the near approach of Morgan, to know if he could find
                                    us arms. He replied that he could not in time. They then sent word to Governor
                                    Boreman of West Va. to know if he could furnish arms but he replied that they were
                                    all in the hands of his own Malitia. There was no other alternative then, than for
                                    each man to furnish his own gun, and all who would agree to go to put their names
                                    down <list type="footnotes">

                                    found the excitement unabated. Men were running to and fro, hunting up fire arms,
                                    moulding bullets and girding on their armour, making one think of the
                                    "Scenes of "76" described in history. It was not long
                                    before quite a "squad" had collected among the number might be
                                    seen the "military figure" of your humble servant. The Omnibuses
                                    were ordered out and we started in the direction of Morristown, (30 or 40 in no.) as
                                    we heard that Morgan was at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> coming down the pike. The panic had likewise spread all over the Co.
                                    and everybody that could raise anything in the shape of a gun or pistol
                                    "rushed to the rescue." At Morristown we were joined by the
                                    Companies of Loydsville, Belmont, Barnesville, Flushing, Morristown, etc., and
                                    stragglers from the surrounding country, swelling our force to about 3 or 400. We
                                    now took up the line of march toward Fairview as we heard the rebs were there and
                                    our intention was to try to head him. When we were west of Morristown some two miles
                                    on Taylors Hill we were met by a courrier who stated that Morgan had had a skirmish
                                    with the "Malish" at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, crossed the pike and was going in the direction of Cadez. We then
                                    retraced our steps and remained in Morristown waiting further orders. Col's
                                    Poorman and Cowen were our field officers, and John A. Work our Captain. In the
                                    meantime the Citizens of Morristown had prepared eatibles and the way the lot of
                                    hungry men pitched into them was a caution, as a great many had not had anything to
                                    eat all day and it was now evening. This spoke well for the hospitality of the
                                    people of Morristown and they will always be remembered by all who were there for
                                    their kindness. We remained there about four hours when word came that Morgan was
                                    striking for the pike again and we were ordered to the road leading in past the
                                    Infirmary as it was supposed that if Morgan came at all he would strike the pike at
                                    that point. So we encamped here for the night sending mounted scouts out in that
                                    direction. As this was my first experience at soldiering, it puzzled me somewhat to
                                    know how I was to put in the night. Presently Elb Kinnon came along and proposed
                                    that we go and hunt some place to sleep. Not fancying the idea of lieing on the
                                    ground, we <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-020-1-096"/> placed four sails on the ground and
                                    stretched ourselves lengthwise with our guns for our pillows. But finding this
                                    rather too hard a bed we began to look around for a softer one, when we found a
                                    haystack close by where a good many of the St. C. boys were resting. Here I did not
                                    sleep much for laughing at "Bob Buff" keeping watch with his
                                    "Gunboat" as he called his old rusty musket. The most of the
                                    soldiery that were out that night were rather "verdant" and not
                                    well versed in the rules of camp. So "<placeName>
                                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                                    </placeName>" was inclined to have a little sport. A great many would come
                                    to the stack to hunt a soft place to rest or some hay to make a bed with. "<placeName>
                                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                                    </placeName>" would halt them with his "Gunboat" pointing
                                    at them, demanding their business and warning them against coming any nearer,
                                    telling them if they wanted hay to go around to the right and get it. They all very
                                    willingly obeyed his orders, saying that they were not aware that they were
                                    transgressing. We were all very thankful that we had "<placeName>
                                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                                    </placeName>" along that night as he kept us in sport, and kept our
                                    sleeping place clear of all intruders. John Morgan may have came through our camp
                                    that night but I "couldn't see him." The next morning
                                    part of our crew took breakfast at John Rattman's in East Rich-land, part
                                    at other places and part didn't take any. Soon in the morning a courier
                                    came with the word that the rebs had taken breakfast that morning at New <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Athens</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Harrison Co. and that his next point was Harrisville. We then all came
                                    back to town and after further consultation among the officers, they concluded to
                                    march toward Harrisville and try to render some assistancy in intercepting the
                                    raiders before they reached the river. But we were too slow for their fleet footed
                                    steed, for by the time we reached the creek (Wheeling) they had passed through
                                    Harrisville and gone in the direction of ——. Our next
                                    "strategtic" move was to go right down the creek and stop the
                                    "gentlemen (!)" if they attempted to come down the plank road and
                                    come up the pike. We arrived at Barnards at one oc'lk and partook of a few
                                    "rations." Now the excitement, already great, increased. People
                                    came flocking in on horseback, in wagons, busses, and on foot, old and young, some
                                    armed and some not, some coming to fight and some coming through curiosity, and
                                    swelling the force to <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-020-1-097"/> about 500. Couriers were
                                    placed on every mile from Bridge-pont to camp and from camp to town. I was placed on
                                    the first mile from town.</p>
                        <p>It was soon ascertained that it was not Morgan's intention to come up this
                                    way and therefore considering the "Stone Bridge" on the big Hill
                                    "Safe" the "Malish" all came up to town to
                                    quarter for the night. Provisions were bountifully donated by the citizens which
                                    were spread out in the Court-House and all who were not fed at private houses eat
                                    until their appetites were fully satisfied. They were then disposed arround town and
                                    in the C. H. for the night. I quartered about 15 in my room and sent 4 up to the
                                    house. The next morning, Sunday, they again partook of breakfast in the C. House and
                                    now the streets might be seen full of men with guns in their hands, lounging about
                                    on the stone, boxes, on the steps, and standing up awaiting anxiously to hear what
                                    was the next on the programe. It was by this time pretty sure that Morgan was so
                                    completely hemmed in Jefferson Co. that there would no longer be any need of the
                                    Malitia here and they were accordingly dismissed and all went home, hoping soon to
                                    hear of the capture of the indomitable Morgan. At noon a dispatch came, announcing
                                    that a battle had taken place at town beyond Stubenville in which from two to three
                                    hundred of Morgan's men and one hundred and fifty horses had been captured,
                                    Morgan himself narrowly escaping. All was quiet now until about 5 o'clock
                                    in the evening when everyone was again aroused by the ringing of the bell, caused by
                                    a courier coming in from Harrisville reporting that the "rebs"
                                    were within a few miles of that place marching back towards Flushing to the pike. In
                                    the meantime however a dispatch had been rec'd that Morgan himself and four
                                    hundred of his men had been captured and his force scattered. It was thought best to
                                    dispatch courriers in the direction they were reported to be coming and ascertain
                                    the truth of the matter. I in company with some others mounted old
                                    "Billy" and galloped off to Harrisville. (I expect you will get
                                    out of patience reading this long letter but I want to tell you all about this
                                    affair). All along the road we found the people very much frightened expecting to
                                    see Morgan dashing along every <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-020-1-098"/> minute. But when
                                    we told them that Morgan was captured they seemed to discredit the other report
                                    somewhat. When we arrived at Harrisville we found that it was all a
                                    "ruse" and that the "rebs" were not more than
                                    fifty miles of there. This morning (Monday) we have the official report of the
                                    capture of Morgan and the balance of his crew. Thus <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> has the name of taking prisoner the indomitable and hitherto
                                    "invincible" John H. Morgan, of the force of nearly five thousand
                                    men, all well mounted, with which Morgan crossed the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> river, only a few stragglers less than one hundred have escaped death
                                    or capture. He was so hotly pursued all the while that he had no opportunity of
                                    doing much mischief and his raid was converted into a flight. He passed all around
                                    Belmont County but never came into it. He stoled a great many horses on his route
                                    but a good many will get their horses back. He took two horses at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> belonging to Sam Lewis, Mr. Lewis has got one of them back and will
                                    probably get the other one, Neiswangers also had one taken. In crossing the C. 0. R.
                                    R. they burnt Campbells Station, 14 miles above Barnesville. I think Morgans raid
                                    has done more good than harm, as it has arroused the people out of their lethargy
                                    and tended to unite the people. This evening the Citizens had a little jolification
                                    over the good news. Speeches were made by Col Poorman, Judge Kennow and Cowen, R. S.
                                    Clark, R. E. Chambers and others. Tar barrels were burnt and everybody rejoiced.
                                    This ends the great "Morgan raid." The family are all as well as
                                    usual. There is no other news of importance. Let Hie Craft read this and it will
                                    answer for both. I would like to be hearing from Spig soon as he has not written for
                                    sometime. Chun Carroll came home last week. He has been sick but is some better. He
                                    and Mary are now in town for a few days.</p>
